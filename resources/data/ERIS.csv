"BACKGROUND: Gyrodactylus salaris is a directly transmitted ectoparasite that reproduces in situ on its fish host. Wild Norwegian (East Atlantic) salmon stocks are thought to be especially susceptible to the parasite due to lack of co-adaptation, contrary to Baltic salmon stocks. This study i) identifies whether time- and density-dependent mechanisms in gyrodactylid population growth exist in G. salaris-Atlantic salmon interactions and ii) based on differences between Norwegian and Baltic stocks, determines whether the 'Atlantic susceptible, Baltic resistant' paradigm holds as an example of local adaptation. METHODS: A total of 18 datasets of G. salaris population growth on individually isolated Atlantic salmon (12 different stocks) infected with three parasite strains were re-analysed using a Bayesian approach. Datasets included over 2000 observations of 388 individual fish. RESULTS: The best fitting model of population growth was time-limited; parasite population growth rate declined consistently from the beginning of infection. We found no evidence of exponential population growth in any dataset. In some stocks, a density dependence in the size of the initial inoculum limited the maximum rate of parasite population growth. There is no evidence to support the hypothesis that all Norwegian and Scottish Atlantic salmon stocks are equally susceptible to G. salaris, while Baltic stocks control and limit infections due to co-evolution. Northern and Western Norwegian as well as the Scottish Shin stocks, support higher initial parasite population growth rates than Baltic, South-eastern Norwegian, or the Scottish Conon stocks, and several Norwegian stocks tested (Akerselva, Altaelva, Lierelva, Numedalslagen), and the Scottish stocks (i.e. Conon, Shin), were able to limit infections after 40-50 days. No significant differences in performance of the three parasite strains (Batnfjordselva, Figga, and Lierelva), or the two parasite mitochondrial haplotypes (A and F) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a spectrum of growth rates, with some fish of the South-eastern Norwegian stocks sustaining parasite population growth rates overlapping those seen on Baltic Neva and Indalsalv stocks. This observation is inconsistent with the 'Baltic-resistant, Atlantic-susceptible' hypothesis, but suggests heterogeneity, perhaps linked to other host resistance genes driven by selection for local disease syndromes.",0
"A Monte Carlo procedure considering the variability in oyster handling from harvest to raw consumption estimated reductions in the number of Vibrio vulnificus induced septicemia cases achieved by high-pressure processing (HPP). The calculations yielded pathogen load distributions in raw oysters from harvest to consumption. In the warm season, 2-6 min treatments at 250 MPa and 1 √ÅC would lower the predicted number of septicemia cases associated with raw oyster consumption from 4932 to less than four per 100 million consumption events (95% confidence). This study highlighted that HPP conditions should be selected according to the seasonal pathogen load and environment temperature. Finally, the procedure emphasized that the variability in the V. vulnificus population at harvest, before and after HPP treatments, reflecting in part the microbiological quantification methods used, significantly affected the estimated number of septicemia cases. Therefore, improving microbiological quantification should provide better predictions of the number of septicemia cases. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Concerns with transgenic animals include the potential ecological risks associated with release or escape to the natural environment, and a critical requirement for assessment of ecological effects is the ability to distinguish transgenic animals from wild type. Here, we explore geometric morphometrics (GeoM) and human expertise to distinguish growth-hormone-transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) specimens from wild type. First, we simulated an escape of 3-month-old hatchery-reared wild-type and transgenic fish to an artificial stream, and recaptured them at the time of seaward migration at an age of 13 months. Second, we reared fish in the stream from first-feeding fry until an age of 13 months, thereby simulating fish arising from a successful spawn in the wild of an escaped hatchery-reared transgenic fish. All fish were then assessed from 'photographs by visual identification (VID) by local staff and by GeoM based on 13 morphological landmarks. A leave-one-out discriminant analysis of GeoM data had on average 86% (72-100% for individual groups) accuracy in assigning the correct genotypes, whereas the human experts were correct, on average, in only 49% of cases (range of 18-100% for individual fish groups). However, serious errors (i.e., classifying transgenic specimens as wild type) occurred for 7% (GeoM) and 67% (VID) of transgenic fish, and all of these incorrect assignments arose with fish reared in the stream from the first-feeding stage. The results show that we presently lack the skills of visually distinguishing transgenic coho salmon from wild type with a high level of accuracy, but that further development-of GeoM methods could be useful in identifying second-generation,fish from nature as a nonmolecular approach.",1
"The activities of 2 species of burrowing shrimp have a negative impact on the growth and survival of oysters reared on intertidal mudflats in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor, Washington (USA). To maintain viable harvests, oyster growers proposed the application of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid onto harvested beds for the control of burrowing shrimp. In test applications, water column concentrations of imidacloprid were relatively low and dissipated rapidly. The foraging activities of the green sturgeon (listed in the US Endangered Species Act) could result in exposure to higher, more sustained imidacloprid concentrations within sediment porewater and from the consumption of contaminated shrimp. Controlled experiments were conducted using surrogate white sturgeon to determine acute and chronic effect concentrations, to examine overt effects at more environmentally realistic concentrations and durations of exposure, and to assess chemical depuration. The 96-h median lethal concentration was 124 mg L(-1) , and the predicted 35-d no-observed-adverse-effect concentration was 0.7 mg L(-1) . No overt effects were observed following environmentally relevant exposures. Imidacloprid half-life in plasma was greater than 32 h. Measured concentrations of imidacloprid in porewater were significantly lower than the derived acute and chronic effect concentrations for white sturgeon. Exposure risk quotients were calculated using the effect concentrations and estimated environmental exposure. The resulting values were considerably below the level of concern for direct effects from either acute or chronic exposure to an endangered species.",1
"Calcium-chelating marine bone collagen oligopeptides (MBCP-Ca) were prepared by using salmon bone as raw material and calcium carbonate as calcium resource. The total protein content, chelating rate and yield were determined. Results showed that the total protein content, chelating rate and yield were 62.56% 0.26%, 51.38% 0.09% and 42.06% 0.10%, respectively. Then, MBCP-Ca was separated and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). A total of 8 fractions were collected and subjected to Q-TOF mass spectrometer to identify peptide sequences. A total of 22 peptide sequences were identified, and most molecular weights of the peptides were below 1000 u.",0
"Cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) were assessed in the edible tissues of Crassrotrea corteziensis oysters collected during the rainy and dry seasons in 27 sites from 8 coastal lagoons of the southeast Gulf of California. In addition, C. palmula oysters were sampled at 9 sites from the same mangrove roots where C. corteziensis oysters were collected. Metal analyses were performed by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Cd, Cu, and Zn), graphite furnace (Pb), and cold vapor detection (Hg). The obtained mean levels were (microg g(-1) dry weight) as follows: Cd 6.05 +/- 2.77, Cu 60.0 +/- 33.4, Hg 0.38 +/- 0.17, Pb 1.11 +/- 0.63, and Zn 777 +/- 528 microg g(-1). For all metals except Hg, the concentrations were greater during dry season than during rainy seasons. The high levels, particularly that for Cd, were related to upwelling along the eastern Gulf of California. High Hg levels in the rainy season were associated with the transport of materials from the watershed to the lagoon. Shrimp farming, agriculture, and other sources were considered as potential sources to explain the differences in metal bioavailability in the 8 lagoons. The mean concentrations of Cd (Santa Maria-La Reforma lagoon), Cu [San Ignacio-Navachiste-El Macapule (SINM), Urias (URI), and Altata-Ensenada del Pabellon lagoons], and zinc (Zn) (URI, Santa Maria-Ohuira-Topolobampo, El Colorado, and SINM lagoons) during the dry season were greater than the maximum permissible limits. C. palmula collected in 8 sites where they were present simultaneously with C. corteziensis had consistently greater metal levels than C. corteziensis, but correlation analyses showed a high and significant (P < 0.05) correlation between metal concentrations in both species. The correlation equations obtained are useful where the same species is not distributed and is necessary to compare results from distinct regions.",0
"We examined 1454 juvenile Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), captured in nearshore waters off the coasts of Washington and Oregon (USA) from 1999 to 2004 for infection by Renibacterium salmoninarum, Nanophyetus salmincola Chapin and skin metacercariae. The prevalence and intensities for each of these infections were established for both yearling and subyearling Chinook salmon. Two metrics of salmon growth, weight residuals and plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, were determined for salmon infected with these pathogens/parasites, both individually and in combination, with uninfected fish used for comparison. Yearling Chinook salmon infected with R. salmoninarum had significantly reduced weight residuals. Chinook salmon infected with skin metacercariae alone did not have significantly reduced growth metrics. Dual infections were not associated with significantly more severe effects on the growth metrics than single infections; the number of triple infections was very low and precluded statistical comparison. Overall, these data suggest that infections by these organisms can be associated with reduced juvenile Chinook salmon growth. Because growth in the first year at sea has been linked to survival for some stocks of Chinook salmon, the infections may therefore play a role in regulating these populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.",0
"A new stochastic model for the simultaneous growth of Listeria monocytogenes and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was developed and validated on data from naturally contaminated samples of cold-smoked Greenland halibut (CSGH) and cold-smoked salmon (CSS). During industrial processing these samples were added acetic and/or lactic acids. The stochastic model was developed from an existing deterministic model including the effect of 12 environmental parameters and microbial interaction (O. Mejlholm and P. Dalgaard, Food Microbiology, submitted for publication). Observed maximum population density (MPD) values of L. monocytogenes in naturally contaminated samples of CSGH and CSS were accurately predicted by the stochastic model based on measured variability in product characteristics and storage conditions. Results comparable to those from the stochastic model were obtained, when product characteristics of the least and most preserved sample of CSGH and CSS were used as input for the existing deterministic model. For both modelling approaches, it was shown that lag time and the effect of microbial interaction needs to be included to accurately predict MPD values of L. monocytogenes. Addition of organic acids to CSGH and CSS was confirmed as a suitable mitigation strategy against the risk of growth by L. monocytogenes as both types of products were in compliance with the EU regulation on ready-to-eat foods.",0
"The function of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) during development and molting has been thoroughly investigated in some arthropods such as insects but rarely in crustacean copepods such as the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis (L. salmonis) (Copepoda, Caligidae). The salmon louse is an ectoparasite on Atlantic salmon that has major economical impact in aquaculture due to the cost of medical treatment methods to remove lice from the fish. Handling of salmon louse infestations is further complicated by development of resistance towards available medicines. Understanding of basic molecular biological processes in the salmon louse is essential to enable development of new tools to control the parasite. In this study, we found L. salmonis EcR (LsEcR) transcript to be present in the neuronal somata of the brain, nuclei of muscle fibres and the immature intestine of the salmon louse. Furthermore, we explored the function of LsEcR during development using RNA interference mediated knock-down and through infection trials. Our results show that knock-down of LsEcR in the salmon louse is associated with hypotrophy of several tissues, delayed development and mortality. In addition, combined knock-down of LsEcR/LsRXR resulted in molting arrest during early larval stages.",0
"Willapa Bay (Washington State, USA) has been 1 of the rare intertidal locations where large-scale pesticide applications occur. Until recently, carbaryl was applied to control burrowing shrimp that decrease commercial oyster productivity. The bay is a critical habitat for green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), an anadromous species listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act. However, the hazard that carbaryl poses is unknown. Surrogate seawater-acclimated white sturgeon (A. transmontanus) were exposed to 0 mug L(-1) , 30 mug L(-1) , 100 mug L(-1) , 300 mug L(-1) , 1000 mug L(-1) , and 3000 mug L(-1) carbaryl for 6 h, and brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities were measured. Enzyme recovery was measured in an additional cohort exposed to 1000 mug L(-1) carbaryl for 6 h. Activity of AChE was reduced (p </= 0.001) at concentrations >/= 100 mug L(-1) with recovery in the 1000 mug L(-1) cohort by 72 h. Surprisingly, BChE activity was greater than controls at concentrations >/= 300 mug L(-1) (p > 0.05), a finding confirmed in additional fish exposed to 3000 mug L(-1) for 6 h (+30%, p < 0.001) with apparent recovery by 48 h. Plasma samples were collected from free-living green sturgeon before and 4 d to 5 d after application of carbaryl in Willapa Bay. Activity of BChE after application was reduced 28% (p < 0.001), indicating exposure to the pesticide. However, the lack of congruence between BChE and AChE activity in captive white sturgeon exposed to carbaryl indicates that further studies are needed to better understand the risk carbaryl exposure poses to green sturgeon.

"Infectious pancreatic necrosis is a significant disease of farmed salmonids resulting in direct economic losses due to high mortality and disease-management costs. Significant outbreaks of the disease occurred in farmed Atlantic salmon in Ireland between 2003 and 2007, associated with imported ova and smolts. As the virus was known to occur in the country since the development of aquaculture in the 1980s, this study examined archived samples to determine whether these older isolates were associated with virulent forms. The study showed that two genotypes of IPNV were present in the 1990s, genotype 3 and genotype 5. A more virulent subtype of the virus first appeared in 2003 associated with clinical outbreaks of IPN, and this subtype is now the most prevalent form of IPNV found in the country. The data also indicated that IPNV in Ireland is more closely related to Scottish and continental European isolates than to Norwegian, Chilean and Australasian genogroup 5 isolates.",1
"We report here the first evidence in an invertebrate, the oyster Crassostrea gigas, of a phenomenon of Presence-Absence Variation (PAV) affecting immune-related genes. We previously evidenced an extraordinary interindividual variability in the basal mRNA abundances of oyster immune genes including those coding for a family of antimicrobial peptides, the big defensins (Cg-BigDef). Cg-BigDef is a diverse family composed of three members: Cg-BigDef1 to -3. Here, we show that besides a high polymorphism in Cg-BigDef mRNA expression, not all individual oysters express simultaneously the three Cg-BigDefs. Moreover, in numerous individuals, no expression of Cg-BigDefs could be detected. Further investigation at the genomic level revealed that in individuals in which the transcription of one or all Cg-BigDefs was absent the corresponding Cg-bigdef gene was missing. In our experiments, no correlation was found between Cg-bigdef PAV and oyster capacity to survive Vibrio infections. The discovery of P-A immune genes in oysters leads to reconsider the role that the immune system plays in the individual adaptation to survive environmental, biotic and abiotic stresses.",0
"The blanching and vacuum were used for deodorizing the oyster meat with sensory evaluation as analysis index. The volatile compounds were determined by headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed that optimum conditions of dedorization were temperature 80√ÅC, time 3 min and the vacuum degree 0.07 MPa. After deodorization, the flavour components of oyster meat decreased from 12 kinds to 10 kinds, the relative content decreased from 19.18% to 15.19%, the odor removal rate reached 20.8%. It showed this method could better removed the flavour components of oyster and the oyster meat flavour increased for furans increased. This study showed that the flavour components of oyster meat can be better removed by the method of blanching and vacuum.",1
"Oyster is taste-well and nutrient-rich, however, which processing and utilization were affected by the fishy flavors. In order to deodorize the hydrolysate of oyster, Mailard reaction was used and the main taste compounds and volatile substances of hydrolysate after Maillard reaction were analyzed. Result showed that Maillard reaction of oyster hydrolysate, which was obtained by flavorzyme and papain, was carried out under the condition that pH of 7, with 2% (w/v) of glucose at 100 √ÅC for 30 min, and the sensitive evaluation of Maillard reaction product was the best. Copared with hydrolysate of oyster before Maillard reaction, lactic acid and succinic acid of hydrolysate after Maillard reaction were increased 26.4% and 20.1%, respectively. ATP related compounds of hydrolysate after Maillard reaction were decreased slightly, free amino acids content of hydrolysate after Maillard reaction was increased 10%, and flavor amino acids of them were increased 14.7%. 41 and 40 kinds of volatile substances were determined from hydrolysates of oyster and it after Maillard reaction, respectively. Aldehydes, ketone and esters compounds of them were decreased significantly after Maillard reaction. Acids, alkane and nitrogen- and sulfur containing compounds were decreased slightly, but alcohol compounds were increased significantly and an ethyl maltol, with fresh and sweet flavor, was produced after Maillard reaction. The results indicated that Maillard reaction could improve the flavour of hydrolysate of oyster, and which products have limitless applications.",0
"Knowledge of the fate of human noroviruses (NoV) in the marine environment is key to better controlling shellfish-related NoV gastroenteritis. We quantified NoV and Escherichia coli in sewage from storm tank discharges and treated effluent processed by a UV-disinfection plant following activated sludge treatment and studied the fate of these microorganisms in an oyster harvesting area impacted by frequent stormwater discharges and infrequent freshwater discharges. Oyster monitoring sites were positioned at intervals downstream from the wastewater treatment works (WwTW) outfall impacting the harvesting area. The decay rates of NoV in oysters as a function of the distance from the outfall were less rapid than those for E. coli that had concentrations of NoV of the same order of magnitude and were over 7 km away from the outfall. Levels of E. coli in oysters from more tidally influenced areas of the estuary were higher around high water than around low water, whereas tidal flows had no influence on NoV contamination in the oysters. The study provides comparative data on the contamination profiles and loadings of NoV and E. coli in a commercial oyster fishery impacted by a WwTW.",0
"A beta Poisson dose-response model for Vibrio vulnificus food poisoning cases leading to septicemia was used to evaluate the effect of depuration at 15 degrees C on the estimated health risk associated with raw oyster consumption. Statistical variability sources included V. vulnificus level at harvest, time and temperature during harvest and transportation to processing plants, decimal reductions (SV) observed during experimental circulation depuration treatments, refrigerated storage time before consumption, oyster size, and number of oysters per consumption event. Although reaching nondetectable V. vulnificus levels (<30 most probable number per gram) throughout the year and a 3.52 SV were estimated not possible at the 95% confidence level, depuration for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days would reduce the warm season (June through September) risk from 2,669 cases to 558, 93, 38, and 47 cases per 100 million consumption events, respectively. At the 95% confidence level, 47 and 16 h of depuration would reduce the warm and transition season (April through May and October through November) risk, respectively, to 100 cases per 100 million consumption events, which is assumed to be an acceptable risk; 1 case per 100 million events would be the risk when consuming untreated raw oysters in the cold season (December through March).",0
"Mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation in fish poses well-known health risks to wildlife and humans through fish consumption. Yet fish Hg concentrations are highly variable, and key factors driving this variability remain unclear. One little studied source of variation is the influence of habitat-specific feeding on Hg accumulation in lake fish. However, this is likely important because most lake fish feed in multiple habitats during their lives, and the Hg and caloric content of prey from different habitats can differ. This study used a three-pronged approach to investigate the extent to which habitat-specific prey determine differences in Hg bioaccumulation in fish. This study first compared Hg concentrations in common nearshore benthic invertebrates and pelagic zooplankton across five lakes and over the summer season in one lake, and found that pelagic zooplankton generally had higher Hg concentrations than most benthic taxa across lakes, and over a season in one lake. Second, using a bioenergetics model, the effects of prey caloric content from habitat-specific diets on fish growth and Hg accumulation were calculated. This model predicted that the consumption of benthic prey results in lower fish Hg concentrations due to higher prey caloric content and growth dilution (high weight gain relative to Hg from food), in addition to lower prey Hg levels. Third, using data from the literature, links between fish Hg content and the degree of benthivory, were examined, and showed that benthivory was associated with reduced Hg concentrations in lake fish. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that higher Hg content and lower caloric content make pelagic zooplankton prey greater sources of Hg for fish than nearshore benthic prey in lakes. Hence, habitat-specific foraging is likely to be a strong driver of variation in Hg levels within and between fish species.",0
"Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor (WA, USA) comprise the largest region of commercial oyster cultivation on the Pacific Coast. The activities of 2 species of burrowing shrimp impair growth and survival of oysters reared on the intertidal mudflats. To maintain viable harvests, the oyster growers have proposed controlling the shrimp by applying the insecticide imidacloprid onto harvested beds. Green sturgeon (listed in the Endangered Species Act) forage on burrowing shrimp and could be exposed to imidacloprid in the sediment porewater and through consumed prey. Studies were conducted to evaluate the likelihood that green sturgeon would be exposed to imidacloprid and to characterize the subsequent environmental exposure. Comparisons between treated and untreated control beds following test application of the insecticide suggested that green sturgeon fed opportunistically on imidacloprid-impaired shrimp. The highest interpolated imidacloprid residue concentrations in field samples following chemical application were 27.8 microg kg(-1) and 31.4 microg kg(-1) in porewater and shrimp, respectively. Results from modeled branchial and dietary uptake, based on conservative assumptions, indicated that the porewater exposure route had the greatest contribution to systemic absorption of imidacloprid. The highest average daily uptake from porewater (177.9 microg kg(-1) body wt) was 9.5-fold greater than total dietary uptake (18.8 microg kg(-1) body wt). Concentrations and durations of exposure would be lower than the levels expected to elicit direct acute or chronic toxic effects.",1
"Local adaptation to heterogeneous environments generates population diversity within species, significantly increasing ecosystem stability and flows of ecosystem services. However, few studies have isolated the specific mechanisms that create and maintain this diversity. Here, we examined the relationship between water temperature in streams used for spawning and genetic diversity at a gene involved in immune function [the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)] in 14 populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) sampled across the Wood River basin in south-western Alaska. The largest influence on MHC diversity was lake basin, but we also found a significant positive correlation between average water temperature and MHC diversity. This positive relationship between temperature and MHC diversity appears to have been produced by natural selection at very local scales rather than neutral processes, as no correlation was observed between temperature and genetic diversity at 90 neutral markers. Additionally, no significant relationship was observed between temperature variability and MHC diversity. Although lake basin was the largest driver of differences in MHC diversity, our results also demonstrate that fine-scale differences in water temperature may generate variable selection regimes in populations that spawn in habitats separated by as little as 1 km. Additionally, our results indicated that some populations may be reaching a maximum level of MHC diversity. We postulate that salmon from populations in warm streams may delay spawning until late summer to avoid thermal stress as well as the elevated levels of pathogen prevalence and virulence associated with warm temperatures earlier in the summer.",0
"UNLABELLED: Little is known about the antiviral response in mollusks. As in other invertebrates, the interferon signaling pathways have not been identified, and in fact, there is a debate about whether invertebrates possess antiviral immunity similar to that of vertebrates. In marine bivalves, due to their filtering activity, interaction with putative pathogens, including viruses, is very high, suggesting that they should have mechanisms to address these infections. In this study, we confirmed that constitutively expressed molecules in naive mussels confer resistance in oysters to ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) when oyster hemocytes are incubated with mussel hemolymph. Using a proteomic approach, myticin C peptides were identified in both mussel hemolymph and hemocytes. Myticins, antimicrobial peptides that have been previously characterized, were constitutively expressed in a fraction of mussel hemocytes and showed antiviral activity against OsHV-1, suggesting that these molecules could be responsible for the antiviral activity of mussel hemolymph. For the first time, a molecule from a bivalve has shown antiviral activity against a virus affecting mollusks. Moreover, myticin C peptides showed antiviral activity against human herpes simplex viruses 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2). In summary, our work sheds light on the invertebrate antiviral immune response with the identification of a molecule with potential biotechnological applications. IMPORTANCE: Several bioactive molecules that have potential pharmaceutical or industrial applications have been identified and isolated from marine invertebrates. Myticin C, an antimicrobial peptide from the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) that was identified by proteomic techniques in both mussel hemolymph and hemocytes, showed potential as an antiviral agent against ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), which represents a major threat to the oyster-farming sector. Both hemolymph from mussels and a myticin C peptide inhibited OsHV-1 replication in oyster hemocytes. Additionally, a modified peptide derived from myticin C or the nanoencapsulated normal peptide also showed antiviral activity against the human herpesviruses HSV-1 and HSV-2. Therefore, myticin C is an example of the biotechnological and therapeutic potential of mollusks.",0
"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious disease that is endemic to salmon farming in Chile and causes great economic losses to the industry. Here we compared different diagnostic methods to detect IPNV in field samples, including 3 real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays, cell culture isolation, and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Additionally, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to investigate the genogroups prevailing in Chile, as well as their geographic distribution and virulence. The 3 qRT-PCR assays used primers that targeted regions of the VP2 and VP1 genes of the virus and were tested in 46 samples, presenting a fair agreement within their results. All samples were positive for at least 2 of the qRT-PCR assays, 29 were positive for cell culture, and 23 for IFAT, showing less sensitivity for these latter 2 methods. For the phylogenetic analysis, portions of 1180 and 523 bp of the VP2 region of segment A were amplified by RT-PCR, sequenced and compared with sequences from reference strains and from isolates reported by previous studies carried out in Chile. Most of the sequenced isolates belonged to genogroup 5 (European origin), and 5 were classified within genogroup 1 (American origin). Chilean isolates formed clusters within each of the genogroups found, evidencing a clear differentiation from the reference strains. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive study completed for IPNV in Chile, covering isolates from sea- and freshwater salmon farms and showing a high prevalence of this virus in the country.",0
"Sea lice are copepod ectoparasites with vast reproductive potential and affect a wide variety of fish species. The number of parasites causing morbidity is proportional to fish size. Natural low host density restricts massive parasite dispersal. However, expanded salmon farming has shifted the conditions in favor of the parasite. Salmon farms are often situated near wild salmonid migrating routes, with smolts being particularly vulnerable to sea lice infestation. In order to protect both farmed and wild salmonids passing or residing in the proximity of the farms, several measures are taken. Medicinal treatment of farmed fish has been the most predictable and efficacious, leading to extensive use of the available compounds. This has resulted in drug-resistant parasites occurring on farmed and possibly wild salmonids.",1
"Introduction. Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vph) is a halophilic bacterium implicated in numerous outbreaks of gastroenteritis involving raw or undercooked oysters, thereby underscoring the need for effective interventions for controlling the pathogen in oysters. Purpose. This study investigated the efficacy of bactericidal concentrations of three GRAS-status phytochemicals, namely trans-cinnamaldehyde (5 mM), carvacrol (6 mM) and eugenol (18 mM) in decreasing Vph in oysters during depuration. Moreover, the efficacy of these phytochemicals in reducing Vph in shucked oysters was determined. Methods. A two-isolate cocktail of Vph (~8 log CFU/ml) was added to artificial seawater tanks to facilitate pathogen accumulation in oysters. Infected oysters were transferred to depuration tanks containing water with or without the phytochemicals. Oysters collected at 0, 6, 12, 24 h of depuration were homogenized in neutralizing broth and enumerated on Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salt Sucrose agar following serial dilutions. Additionally, shucked oysters were surface-inoculated with ~6 log CFU of Vph and subjected to air-drying for 30 min. The oyster meat was treated with the phytochemicals for 2 min, and surviving Vph was enumerated as before. Both experiments had duplicate samples and repeated three times. Results. In the depuration experiment, the average accumulation of Vph was ~6 log CFU/oyster. Approximately 4.5 to 5.0 log CFU of Vph/oyster was recovered from control samples. However, the presence of phytochemicals in the depuration water decreased Vph by ~3.5 log CFU/oyster (P< 0.05). Additionally, trans-cinnamaldehyde and eugenol reduced Vph on shucked oyster meat to undetectable levels, whereas carvacrol decreased the pathogen by ~5.0 log CFU/oyster (P< 0.05). Significance. The results suggest that trans-cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol and eugenol could potentially be used to reduce Vph in oysters. However, the effect of these phytochemicals on the sensory characteristics of oysters needs to determined. Additionally, follow up studies under commercial settings are necessary to validate these results.",0
"Viral diseases are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in oysters, resulting in significant economic losses. We investigated the proteomic responses of these two species of oysters to generic double-stranded RNAs (poly I:C and poly A:U). Analysis of proteomic data using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitaion (iTRAQ) indicated that there were significant differences in the proteomic responses of the two oyster species resulting from this treatment. Gene ontology analysis showed that several biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function were unique to the different data sets. For example, a number of proteins implicated in the TLR signaling pathway were associated with the Saccostrea glomerata data set but were absent in the Crassostra gigas data set. These results suggest that the differences in the proteomic responses to dsRNA may underpin the biological differences in viral susceptibility. Molecular targets previously shown to be expressed in C. gigas in response to OsHV1 infections were not present in our proteomic data sets, although they were present in the RNA extracted from the very same tissues. Taken together, our data indicate that there are substantial disparities between transcriptomic and proteomic responses to dsRNA challenge, and a comprehensive account of the oysters' biological responses to these treatments must take into account that disparity.",0
"The plant pathogen Fusarium proliferatum has a wide host range and occurs worldwide. Many isolates of the fungus produce mycotoxins in plant tissues, which, if ingested, can cause harm to animals and humans. In 2008, an outbreak of salmon blotch of onions, caused by F. proliferatum, was detected in southern Israel. The source and distribution of the fungus in Israel were unknown. Inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR) were used to identify repetitive motifs present in seven isolates of F. proliferatum from Israel, Germany and Austria. ISSR repeat motifs were, used to develop 17 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Six of these SSR markers were polymorphic in and consistently amplified from ten isolates collected in Israel, Germany, Austria and North America, from cucumber, onion, garlic, maize, and asparagus. These six polymorphic SSR alleles included 5 to 12 copies of di-, tri, and pentanucleotide motifs and yielded six to 9 alleles each. Sixteen of the SSR loci were amplified at least one of the seven Fusarium species, F. verticillioides, F. thapsinum, F. subglutinans, F. andiyazi, F. globosum, F. fujikoroi and F. oxysporum. The data demonstrate that these SSRs can be used for characterization of F. proliferatum isolates from diverse hosts and geographic locations and that they are transferable to other species of Fusarium.",0
"Oysters accumulate zinc at high tissue concentrations, and the metal response element (MRE)-binding transcription factor (MTF) functions as the cellular zinc sensor that coordinates the expression of genes involved in zinc efflux and storage, as well as those that protect against metal toxicity. In this study, we cloned MTF-1 in oysters and examined its regulation mechanism for its classic target genes, including MTs and ZnT1 under zinc exposure conditions. We cloned CgMTF-1 and determined the subcellular locations of its protein product in HEK293 cells. CgMTF-1 has a 2826bp open reading frame that encodes a predicted polypeptide with 707 amino acid residues, showing six well-conserved zinc finger domains that are required for metal binding. In HEK293 cell lines, CgMTF-1 primarily localizes in the cell nucleus under unstressed conditions and nuclear translocation was not critical for the activation of this gene. We searched for CgMTF-1-regulated genes in oysters using RNA interference. Decreased expression levels of CgMT1, CgMT4, and CgZnT1 were observed after CgMTF-1 interference (>70% inhibition) under zinc exposure, indicating the critical role of CgMTF-1 in the regulation of these genes. We searched for a direct regulation mechanism involving CgMTF-1 for CgMT1, CgMT4, and CgZnT1 in vitro. EMSA experiments indicated that CgMTF-1 can bind with the MREs found in the CgZnT1, CgMT1 and CgMT4 promoter regions. Additionally, luciferase reporter gene experiments indicated that CgMTF-1 could activate the CgMT1, CgMT4, and CgZnT1 promoters. Overall, our results suggest that CgMTF-1 directly coordinates the regulation of CgMTs and CgZnT1 expression and plays important roles in protecting oysters under zinc exposure conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the function of MTF-1 in marine bivalves and provides new insights into the mechanisms of zinc accumulation and tolerance in mollusks.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Crassostrea gigas oyster extract has been reported to have antioxidant, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering properties that may be useful for treating cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of C. gigas oyster extract on cardiovascular function in tissues from healthy rats. METHODS: Single-cell microelectrode and isolated thoracic aortic organ bath studies were performed on tissues from 8-week-old healthy Wistar rats, using varying concentrations of C. gigas oyster extract. To elucidate a mechanism of action for the oyster's vasoactive properties, concentration response curves were carried out in the presence of a calcium channel inhibitior (verapamil), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester), a potassium channel inhibitor (4-aminopyridine), in addition to the alpha-adrenoceptor inhibitor prazosin. RESULTS: Oyster solution at 7 500 mg/mL inhibited noradrenaline-induced contraction in isolated aortic rings. Cardiac electrophysiology results showed that neither concentration of oyster solution was able to significantly reduce action potential duration at all phases of repolarisation in left ventricular papillary muscles from healthy animals. CONCLUSION: When administered to healthy vascular tissue, C. gigas oyster extract inhibits contraction induced by noradrenaline. This effect is likely to be mediated through alpha-adrenoceptor inhibition, and to a lesser extent, calcium modulating activity.",0
"Interaction of oleuropein, the major bio-phenol in olive leaf and fruit, with salmon sperm double-stranded DNA was investigated by employing electronic absorption titrations, fluorescence quenching spectroscopy, competitive fluorescence spectroscopy, thermal denaturation and voltammetric studies. Titration of oleuropein with the DNA caused a hypochromism accompanied with a red shift indicating an intercalative mode of interaction. Binding constant of 1.4x10(4) M(-1) was obtained for this interaction. From the curves of fluorescence titration of oleuropein with the DNA, binding constant and binding sites were calculated to be 8.61x10(3) M(-1) and 1.05, respectively. Competitive studies with ethidium bromide (a well-known DNA intercalator) showed that the bio-phenol could take the place of ethidium bromide in the DNA intercalation sites. The interaction of oleuropein with DNA was also studied electrochemically. In the presence of the DNA, the anodic and cathodic peak currents of oleuropein decreased accompanied with increases in peak-to-peak potential separation and formal potential, indicating the intercalation of oleuropein into the DNA double helix. Moreover, melting temperature of the DNA was found to increase in the presence of oleuropein, indicating the stabilization of the DNA double helix due to an intercalative interaction.",0
"Replacing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA)-rich fish oil with alternative lipids in Florida Pompano Trachinotus carolinus feeds is likely to cause tissue LC-PUFA depletion in a manner similar to that observed in other species; however, there is little information available regarding fish oil sparing in this species. Moreover, it is unknown whether alternative lipids with different levels of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), or C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18 PUFAs) are equally suitable in this context. Accordingly, we assessed the production performance and tissue composition of juvenile Florida Pompano (43.4 0.2 g) fed diets containing menhaden fish oil (FISH) or 25:75 blends of fish oil and standard soybean oil (C18 PUFA SOY), MUFA-enriched soybean oil (MUFA SOY), SFA-enriched soybean oil (SFA SOY), palm oil (PALM), or poultry fat (POULTRY). After 8 weeks, all diets were well accepted, and weight gain (228 20%, grand mean SE) and specific growth rate (2.2 0.1% body weight/day) were unaffected by dietary treatment. Feed conversion ratio, feed intake, and hepatosomatic index varied among treatments; however, the ranges of values observed were relatively narrow (FCR = 1.33-1.61, feed intake = 3.09-3.65% body weight/day, HSI = 1.1-1.5) and pairwise comparisons revealed few differences among treatments. Fatty acid profiles of the fillet, liver, and eye tissues generally mirrored dietary fatty acid composition, whereas the brain tissue was more resistant to dietary influence. Compared to those fed the FISH diet, fillets of fish fed the reduced fish oil diets had lower levels of n-3 fatty acids and LC-PUFAs, and greater levels of the fatty acids that were abundant in the alternative lipids. These trends were observed, albeit to a lesser extent in liver and eye tissues, but not in brain tissue, which was relatively resistant to diet-induced compositional change. In general, tissue fatty acid profile distortion was greatest among fish fed the MUFA SOY and C18 PUFA SOY diets, least overt among fish fed the SFA SOY diet, and intermediate among fish fed the PALM and POULTRY diets. All alternative lipids appeared effective as partial substitutes for menhaden fish oil, but fully hydrogenated, SFA-rich soybean oil may offer some strategic advantage in terms of limiting diet-induced modification of tissue fatty acid profile in Florida Pompano. Statement of relevance. As there are few studies addressing lipid nutrition of Trachinotus spp. and there is scarce information regarding the influence of different alternative lipid source on tissue levels of LC-PUFAs in these species, this study is relevant to aquafeed manufacturers and those culturing Florida Pompano and other Trachinotus spp. The present results provide valuable information regarding alternative lipids in marine carnivorous finfish feeds and their effects on fish performance and tissue fatty acid composition. Further, these findings highlight the promising potential of fully hydrogenated, SFA-rich soybean oil in aquafeeds. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"In 2013 Allium cepa bulbs from different fields in Northern and Southern Germany, seeds and sets from onion breeders were analysed for infestation with Fusarium species. The same investigation was done in 2014 with different edible Allium spp. from local markets. Different Fusarium spp. were isolated and identified by morphological characterisation. 24 different Fusarium spp. were identified. The diversity of Fusarium spp. and the intensity of infestation was higher on edible bulbs compared to the younger sets and seeds. The analysed onions and other edible Allium spp. from local markets showed also high contents of different Fusarium species. The most prevalent identified Fusarium sp. in the analysed Allium spp. in Germany was Fusarium oxysporum which can cause the Fusarium Basal Rot, followed by Fusarium solani. Fusarium proliferatum, which can cause the Fusarium Salmon Blotch in onions, could be detected in about half of the sampled onion fields and in approximately 10% of all analysed onions from fields. Also in the onion sets, on the surface of the seeds and in other edible Allium spp. F. proliferatum could be identified. Besides F. proliferatum, further mycotoxin producing Fusarium spp. like Fusarium equiseti or Fusarium tricinctum were identified. Other Fusarium spp. like Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium poae were first described in Allium sp. in this study. The two most prevalent Fusarium spp. F. oxysporum and F. solani are able to produce mycotoxins like enniatins, fumonisins, moniliformin and T-2 toxins. Fusarium sp. like F. proliferatum, F. equiseti and F. tricinctum are able to produce additional toxins like beauvericins, zearalenone and diacetoscirpenol. This high number of Fusarium spp., which are able to produce a broad spectrum of different mycotoxins, could be a potential health risk for human beings and livestock.",0
"The physicochemical properties of oyster shell-derived adsorbents prepared by calcination at different temperatures were characterized by elemental analysis, specific surface area, particle size distribution, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The pH value in natural oyster shell increased from 9 to 12.7 following calcination above 750 degrees C. All of the oyster shell-derived adsorbents exhibited a BET surface area that ranged from 1.8 to 64.6 m(2)/g. Clearly, the proportion of particles within the ranges 25-50 mum and 50-100 mum increased after calcination, regardless of calcination temperature. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics of cadmium (Cd) were investigated, and the mechanisms of sorption discussed. Experimental equilibrium data were fitted to a Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. Most Cd adsorption occurred during the initial hours of contact time, and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model best fitted the adsorption process. Cd sorption profiles indicated an initial, low Cd sorption region (25.25-32.36 mg/g) that was associated with calcination temperatures of up to 650 degrees C for 2 h, and a second region that contributed to high Cd sorption from 750 degrees C, with the maximum sorption capacity reaching a value of 1666.67 mg/g at 900 degrees C. The high Cd-removal capacity of oyster shell-derived adsorbents above 750 degrees C is attributed to their enhanced specific surface area, their material porosity, the bulk precipitation of Cd hydroxide and otavite on shell fragments, the formation of ettringite as a secondary precipitate, and ion exchange via Ca ions. This study highlights the effectiveness of calcined oyster shells in Cd removal from highly contaminated water and wastewater.",0
"Captive rearing programs (hatcheries) are often used in conservation and management efforts for at-risk salmonid fish populations. However, hatcheries typically rear juveniles in environments that contrast starkly with natural conditions, which may lead to phenotypic and/or genetic changes that adversely affect the performance of juveniles upon their release to the wild. Environmental enrichment has been proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficacy of population restoration efforts from captive-rearing programs; in this study, we examine the influence of environmental enrichment during embryo and yolk-sac larval rearing on the transcriptome of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Full siblings were reared in either a hatchery environment devoid of structure or an environment enriched with gravel substrate. At the end of endogenous feeding by juveniles, we examined patterns of gene transcript abundance in head tissues using the cGRASP-designed Agilent 4x44K microarray. Significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) indicated that 808 genes were differentially transcribed between the rearing environments and a total of 184 gene ontological (GO) terms were over- or under-represented in this gene list, several associated with mitosis/cell cycle and muscle and heart development. There were also pronounced differences among families in the degree of transcriptional response to rearing environment enrichment, suggesting that gene-by-environment effects, possibly related to parental origin, could influence the efficacy of enrichment interventions.",0
"C-type lectins (CTLs), serving as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), are a superfamily of Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-recognition proteins that participate in nonself-recognition and pathogen elimination. In the present study, a single carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) CTL was identified from oyster Crassostrea gigas (designated as CgCLec-2). There was only one CRD within the deduced amino acid sequence of CgCLec-2 consisting of 129 amino acid residues. A conserved EPN (Glu246-Pro247-Asn248) motif was found in Ca(2+)-binding site 2 of CgCLec-2. The CgCLec-2 mRNA could be detected in all the examined tissues at different expression levels in oysters. The mRNA expression of CgCLec-2 in hemocytes was up-regulated significantly at 6 h post Vibrio splendidus challenge. The recombinant CgCLec-2 (rCgCLec-2) could bind various Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), including lipopolysaccharide, mannan and peptidoglycan, and displayed strong binding abilities to Vibrio anguillarum, V. splendidus and Yarrowiali polytica and week binding ability to Staphylococcus aureus. It could also enhance the phagocytic activity of oyster hemocytes to V. splendidus and exhibited growth suppression activity against gram-positive bacteria S. aureus but no effect on gram-negative bacteria V. splendidus. Furthermore, the interaction between rCgCLec-2 and rCgMASPL-1 was confirmed by GST Pull down. The results suggested that CgCLec-2 served as not only a PRR in immune recognition but also a regulatory factor in pathogen elimination, and played a potential role in the activation of complement system.",0
"Over the last decade, risk analysis has gradually been introduced as a tool to make decisions about food safety policies. In this framework, the ALOP (Appropriate Level of Protection) concept, which can be seen as a statement of the degree of public protection that should be attained in a country, was introduced. In addition, FSO (Food Safety Objectives) was introduced to provide a link between the ALOP and target points/goals in the supply chain. Historically, ALOP and FSO decisions have been based on the ALARA (As Low As reasonably Achievable) approach. Since an ALARA approach is based on the status of current technology, it is likely that the ALOP is attainable, provided a substantial portion of the industry complies with technological requirements or adopt ""best practices"" that will achieve the FSO. Food managers must control and government agencies must enforce and monitor the fulfilment of FSO. Once FSO has been established and adopted by the food industry, a major concern is to evaluate the results of the implementation of FSO in order to verify compliance. This paper introduces the concept of food safety margin (FSM) and its formulation based on classical and probabilistic approaches, which are intended to be used as a tool to measure the degree of compliance with FSO. For a better understanding of how food safety margins perform, FSM are estimated for Listeria monocytogenes in three different products, (semi-soft cheese, heat treated meat and cold smoked salmon). The results obtained, adopting both classical and probabilistic approaches, are discussed. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Kudoa thyrsites (Myxozoa) encysts within myocytes of a variety of fishes. While infected fish appear unharmed, parasite-derived enzymes degrade the flesh post-mortem. In regions of British Columbia (BC), Canada, up to 4-7% of fillets can be affected, thus having economic consequences and impacting the competitiveness of BC's farms. K. thyrsites was monitored in two farms having high (HP) or low (LP) historical infection prevalence. At each farm, 30 fish were sampled monthly for blood and muscle during the first year followed by nine samplings during year two. Prevalence and intensity were measured by PCR and histology of muscle samples. In parallel, fillet tests were used to quantify myoliquefaction. Infections were detected by PCR after 355 and 509 degree days at LP and HP farms, respectively. Prevalence reached 100% at the HP farm by 2265 degree days and declined during the second year, whereas it plateaued near 50% at the LP farm. Infection intensities decreased after 1 year at both farms. Blood was PCR-positive at both farms between 778 and 1113 degree days and again after 2000 degree days. This is the first monitoring project in a production environment and compares data between farms with different prevalence.",0
"Amoebic gill disease (AGD) affects salmonids during the marine grow-out phase in the Tasmanian industry and in other major salmonid producing countries. During the period post-transfer to seawater, the bacterial condition yersiniosis can also cause high levels of mortality in Atlantic salmon grown in Tasmania, in addition to the hatchery outbreaks. The recombinant protein r22C03, a mannose-binding protein-like (MBP-like) similar to attachment factors of other amoebae, was tested as a vaccine candidate against AGD in a large scale challenge trial. Fish were immunised with r22C03 combined with FCA via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, and given a booster five weeks later by either i.p. injection (RP group) or by a dip-immersion (mRP). Fish were then challenged twice with Neoparamoeba perurans: the initial challenge 16 weeks after primary immunisation was terminated due to presence of ulcerative lesions in the skin of salmon; the second challenge was carried out after five weeks of treatment with oxytetracycline. These skin lesions might have been associated with a concurrent infection with Yersinia ruckeri, which was detected by real-time qPCR in serum of a large proportion of moribund and survivor fish after the AGD challenge. Before and during the N. perurans infection, levels of antibodies against r22C03 were measured by ELISA in serum, skin mucus and supernatant from skin and gill explants. For the second challenge, the average size of AGD lesions was recorded from histology sections and survival curves were obtained. Before AGD challenge, r22C03 induced antibody responses in serum and explants with both vaccination strategies. At the end of the challenge, levels of antibodies were lower than before challenge irrespective of treatment. Both vaccinated groups presented increased serum antibody responses, while only mRP presented antibody responses in skin mucus, and no significant antibody responses were measured in the explants. Antibodies did not confer protection to N. perurans infection, as no difference was observed in the survival curves of the vaccinated and control groups, and there was no effect on the gill lesion size. The concurrent yersiniosis infection probably represented more closely infection patterns observed in commercial settings. However, it could have interfered with the survival results and with the ability of the fish to respond to the amoebae infection.",0
"A fundamental step in cellular defense mechanisms is the recognition of ""danger signals"" made of conserved pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by invading pathogens, by host cell germ line coded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). In this study, we used RNA-seq and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) to identify PRRs together with the network pathway of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that recognize salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV-3) infection in macrophage/dendritic like TO-cells derived from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) headkidney leukocytes. Our findings show that recognition of SAV-3 in TO-cells was restricted to endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 8 together with RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and not the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors NOD-like receptor (NLRs) genes. Among the RLRs, upregulated genes included the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation association 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2). The study points to possible involvement of the tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) in modulating RIG-I signaling being the first report that links these genes to the RLR pathway in SAV-3 infection in TO-cells. Downstream signaling suggests that both the TLR and RLR pathways use interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) 3 and 7 to produce IFN-a2. The validity of RNA-seq data generated in this study was confirmed by quantitative real time qRT-PCR showing that genes up- or downregulated by RNA-seq were also up- or downregulated by RT-PCR. Overall, this study shows that de novo transcriptome assembly identify key receptors of the TLR and RLR sensors engaged in host pathogen interaction at cellular level. We envisage that data presented here can open a road map for future intervention strategies in SAV infection of salmon.",0
"Chemical pollution by pesticides has been identified as a possible contributing factor to the massive mortality outbreaks observed in Crassostrea gigas for several years. A previous study demonstrated the vertical transmission of DNA damage by subjecting oyster genitors to the herbicide diuron at environmental concentrations during gametogenesis. This trans-generational effect occurs through damage to genitor-exposed gametes, as measured by the comet-assay. The presence of DNA damage in gametes could be linked to the formation of DNA damage in other germ cells. In order to explore this question, the levels and cell distribution of the oxidized base lesion 8-oxodGuo were studied in the gonads of exposed genitors. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV and electrochemical detection analysis showed an increase in 8-oxodGuo levels in both male and female gonads after exposure to diuron. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the presence of 8-oxodGuo at all stages of male germ cells, from early to mature stages. Conversely, the oxidized base was only present in early germ cell stages in female gonads. These results indicate that male and female genitors underwent oxidative stress following exposure to diuron, resulting in DNA oxidation in both early germ cells and gametes, such as spermatozoa, which could explain the transmission of diuron-induced DNA damage to offspring. Furthermore, immunostaining of early germ cells seems indicates that damages caused by exposure to diuron on germ line not only affect the current sexual cycle but also could affect future gametogenesis.",0
"Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleotide analog capable of inhibiting or even preventing some viral infections in mammals and also in fish. It has been seen by others that ribavirin by itself is able to stimulate the immune system of mammals, causing a differentiation of T-cells to T helper 1 cells (Th)-1. In this work, we evaluated the immune effect of ribavirin in vitro on kidney cells from Atlantic salmon and in vivo by oral administration of ribavirin to Atlantic salmon. For this purpose, the transcripts of immune molecules Tbet, GATA3, CD8, CD4, IFNalpha, IFNgamma, IL-4/13, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15 and TGF-B were quantified. The results show that ribavirin administered orally in food to Atlantic salmon increased IFNgamma and CD4 transcripts in the in vivo assays and, in addition, increased IL-12, IL-15 and CD8 in the in vitro analyses, indicating that the treatment stimulates a Th1 type response in salmon.",0
"The increasing rate of occurrence and persistence of climatic events causing salinity shifts, in combination with contamination, may further challenge organisms response to environmental stress. Hence, we studied the effects of different salinity levels (10, 20, 30 and 40) on the response of the oyster Crassostrea angulata to Arsenic (As) exposure (4 mg L(-1)). Total As, Na(+) and K(+) concentrations in oyster tissues were determined. Biochemical analysis were performed to assess osmotic regulation (CA), metabolism (ETS), enzymatic (SOD, CAT and GSTs) and non-enzymatic (GSH/GSSG and LPO) markers of oxidative stress. Results obtained showed significantly higher metabolic activities in oysters maintained in low salinity (10) exposure, coupled with higher As accumulation, as well as higher SOD and CAT activities, compared to higher salinities (30 and 40). GSTs activity and LPO levels were higher in oysters exposed to As at salinities 20, 30 and 40, compared to the same conditions without As. From our findings we concluded that the response of C. angulata to As is influenced by salinity. At the lowest salinity (10) oysters accumulated higher As concentrations, here attributed to higher metabolic rate involved in physiological osmoregulation, also stimulating antioxidant related enzymes activity (SOD and CAT) and thus preventing increased LPO (higher ETS activity also observed without As). On the contrary, at salinities 30 and 40 with As, antioxidant SOD and CAT were inhibited, enabling for LPO generation. Given our results, the effects of As on the oysters antioxidant capacity appears to be more deleterious under higher salinities (20, 30 and 40), comparing to salinity 10. The differentiated responses demonstrated in the present study in C. angulata oysters exposed to As under different salinities, bring new insights on the mechanisms of environmental adaptability of this species, namely to salinity shifts, and the interactions between such alterations and As exposure.",0
"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was introduced from Japan to many countries in the world for oyster farming, resulting in the establishment of wild populations in intertidal zones and resource competition with local faunas. This study examined physiological responses of wild oysters and farmed oysters to thermal (15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 44 degrees C) and salinity stress (39, 50 and 60ppt). The wild oysters produced more 72kDa heat shock proteins when the temperature increased from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C and the salinity increased from 39 to 50 and 60ppt. However, the amount of 69kDa heat shock protein was similar between farmed and wild oysters when the temperature increased from 15 degrees C to the sublethal temperature 37 degrees C, but it was lower in wild oysters than in farmed oysters when the temperature increased from 15 degrees C to the lethal temperature 44 degrees C. In the tissues, wild oysters used more glycogen to promote metabolic activities by increasing the level of AEC (adenylate energy charge). The results suggest that farmed oysters might have limited ability to cope with heat stress due to low energy reserve and glycolysis activity for HSP synthesis. This study provides experimental evidence on differential responses between wild and farmed oysters to temperature and salinity changes, leading to a better understanding on the pattern of distribution for invading oyster species in the marine environment and the adaptation of marine invertebrates to the threat of climate change.",0
"Lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from fresh water catfish collected from a local market. The probiotic-like characteristics of the bacteria, and its antibacterial effects against common food-borne and fish pathogens, were investigated by growing it in different diverse conditions (varying osmolarity, bile salt, acid and alkaline conditions, and temperature). The L. plantarum was encapsulated in a mixture of alginate and fish gelatin protein at different concentrations to enhance its protection during incorporation into fish feed pellets. The significance of encapsulation was proven by exposing the encapsulated L. plantarum to harsh conditions in comparison to un-encapsulated cells as a control. The results suggest that 2 % alginate and 13 % gelatin coating material had optimal textural properties, with a hardness of 1.436 N, high viscosity of 20.23 cP and highest encapsulation efficiency with 8.45 log colony forming units (CFU). The bacteria showed antagonistic effects against the fish pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae, and other common pathogens such as Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Encapsulated L. plantarum was found to tolerate pH 2 and pH 8 more efficiently compared to un-encapsulated cells, and encapsulated cells survived 6 log CFU from an initial 8.23 log CFU count at low pH 2 after a 90-min incubation and showed resistance to 50 √ÅC for 1 h. Thus, the isolated L. plantarum was found to have potential to be used successfully in fish feed and other similar applications. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and the University of Milan 2014.",1
"Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer, 1837), are fish ectoparasites causing significant economic damage in the mariculture of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758. The control of L. salmonis at fish farms relies to a large extent on treatment with anti-parasitic drugs. A problem related to chemical control is the potential for development of resistance, which in L. salmonis is documented for a number of drug classes including organophosphates, pyrethroids and avermectins. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene superfamily is found in all biota and includes a range of drug efflux transporters that can confer drug resistance to cancers and pathogens. Furthermore, some ABC transporters are recognised to be involved in conferral of insecticide resistance. While a number of studies have investigated ABC transporters in L. salmonis, no systematic analysis of the ABC gene family exists for this species. This study presents a genome-wide survey of ABC genes in L. salmonis for which, ABC superfamily members were identified through homology searching of the L. salmonis genome. In addition, ABC proteins were identified in a reference transcriptome of the parasite generated by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of a multi-stage RNA library. Searches of both genome and transcriptome allowed the identification of a total of 33 genes / transcripts coding for ABC proteins, of which 3 were represented only in the genome and 4 only in the transcriptome. Eighteen sequences were assigned to ABC subfamilies known to contain drug transporters, i.e. subfamilies B (4 sequences), C (11) and G (2). The results suggest that the ABC gene family of L. salmonis possesses fewer members than recorded for other arthropods. The present survey of the L. salmonis ABC gene superfamily will provide the basis for further research into potential roles of ABC transporters in the toxicity of salmon delousing agents and as potential mechanisms of drug resistance.",0
"Contaminant effects on defence responses of ecologically and economically important organisms, such as the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, are likely to influence their ability to resist infectious diseases, particularly at the young stages. The aim of this study was to explore the potential relationships between organic contaminants accumulated in the soft tissues of juvenile oysters, defence responses and physiological condition. Oysters were transplanted during summer and winter periods in different sites in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, the first area of oyster production in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Amongst the battery of biochemical and physiological biomarkers applied in the present work [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondyaldehyde (MDA), catecholase, laccase and lysozyme in gills, digestive glands, mantle and haemolymph, glycogen, proteins and lipids in the digestive gland and the condition index at the whole-organism level], MDA and lysozyme in the digestive gland and SOD, GPx and laccase in plasma contributed in order to significantly discriminate the sites in which oysters bioaccumulated different levels of heavy polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polybromodiphenylethers (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and lindane. These results strengthen the hypothesis that it is possible to differentiate sites depending on their contamination levels and biological effects by carrying out studies with transplanted juvenile oysters. In addition, correlations were found between antioxidant and immune-defence responses, and PAH and DDT body burdens in the first area of oyster production in France (the Marennes-Oleron Bay) and where considerable oyster mortalities have been reported. This result suggests that the presence of organic chemical contaminants in the Marennes-Oleron Bay may influence defence responses in juveniles of C. gigas, and, therefore, could influence their ability to resist infectious diseases.",1
"UNLABELLED: Poxviruses are large DNA viruses of vertebrates and insects causing disease in many animal species, including reptiles, birds, and mammals. Although poxvirus-like particles were detected in diseased farmed koi carp, ayu, and Atlantic salmon, their genetic relationships to poxviruses were not established. Here, we provide the first genome sequence of a fish poxvirus, which was isolated from farmed Atlantic salmon. In the present study, we used quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry to determine aspects of salmon gill poxvirus disease, which are described here. The gill was the main target organ where immature and mature poxvirus particles were detected. The particles were detected in detaching, apoptotic respiratory epithelial cells preceding clinical disease in the form of lethargy, respiratory distress, and mortality. In moribund salmon, blocking of gas exchange would likely be caused by the adherence of respiratory lamellae and epithelial proliferation obstructing respiratory surfaces. The virus was not found in healthy salmon or in control fish with gill disease without apoptotic cells, although transmission remains to be demonstrated. PCR of archival tissue confirmed virus infection in 14 cases with gill apoptosis in Norway starting from 1995. Phylogenomic analyses showed that the fish poxvirus is the deepest available branch of chordopoxviruses. The virus genome encompasses most key chordopoxvirus genes that are required for genome replication and expression, although the gene order is substantially different from that in other chordopoxviruses. Nevertheless, many highly conserved chordopoxvirus genes involved in viral membrane biogenesis or virus-host interactions are missing. Instead, the salmon poxvirus carries numerous genes encoding unknown proteins, many of which have low sequence complexity and contain simple repeats suggestive of intrinsic disorder or distinct protein structures. IMPORTANCE: Aquaculture is an increasingly important global source of high-quality food. To sustain the growth in aquaculture, disease control in fish farming is essential. Moreover, the spread of disease from farmed fish to wildlife is a concern. Serious poxviral diseases are emerging in aquaculture, but very little is known about the viruses and the diseases that they cause. There is a possibility that viruses with enhanced virulence may spread to new species, as has occurred with the myxoma poxvirus in rabbits. Provision of the first fish poxvirus genome sequence and specific diagnostics for the salmon gill poxvirus in Atlantic salmon may help curb this disease and provide comparative knowledge. Furthermore, because salmon gill poxvirus represents the deepest branch of chordopoxvirus so far discovered, the genome analysis provided substantial insight into the evolution of different functional modules in this important group of viruses.",1
"The evolution of drug resistant parasitic sea lice is of major concern to the salmon farming industry worldwide and challenges sustainable growth of this enterprise. To assess current status and development of L. salmonis sensitivity towards different pesticides used for parasite control in Norwegian salmon farming, a national surveillance programme was implemented in 2013. The programme aims to summarize data on the use of different pesticides applied to control L. salmonis and to test L. salmonis sensitivity to different pesticides in farms along the Norwegian coast. Here we analyse two years of test-data from biological assays designed to detect sensitivity-levels towards the pesticides azamethiphos and deltamethrin, both among the most common pesticides used in bath-treatments of farmed salmon in Norway in later years. The focus of the analysis is on how different variables predict the binomial outcome of the bioassay tests, being whether L. salmonis are immobilized/die or survive pesticide exposure. We found that local kernel densities of bath treatments, along with a spatial geographic index of test-farm locations, were significant predictors of the binomial outcome of the tests. Furthermore, the probability of L. salmonis being immobilized/dead after test-exposure was reduced by odds-ratios of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.42-0.86) for 2014 compared to 2013 and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.36-0.42) for low concentration compared to high concentration exposure. There were also significant but more marginal effects of parasite gender and developmental stage, and a relatively large random effect of test-farm. We conclude that the present data support an association between local intensities of bath treatments along the coast and the outcome of bioassay tests where salmon lice are exposed to azamethiphos or deltamethrin. Furthermore, there is a predictable structure of L. salmonis phenotypes along the coast in the data, characterized by high susceptibility to pesticides in the far north and far south, but low susceptibility in mid Norway. The study emphasizes the need to address local susceptibility to pesticides and the need for restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment efficacy.",0
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a leading cause of seafood-borne infections in the US. This organism has a high genetic diversity that complicates identification of strain relatedness and epidemiological investigations. However, sequence-based analysis methods are promising tools for these identifications. In this study, Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and Multiple-Locus Variable-Number Tandem-Repeat Analysis (MLVA) was performed on 58 V. parahaemolyticus isolates (28 of oyster and 30 of clinical origin), to identify differences in phylogeny. The results obtained by both methods were compared to Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns determined in a previous study. Forty-one unique sequence types (STs) were identified by MLST among the 58 isolates. Almost half of the isolates (22) belonged to a new ST and added to the MLST database. A ST could not be generated for 5 (8.6%) isolates, primarily due to an untypable recA locus. Analysis with eBURST did not identify any clonal complex among the strains analyzed and revealed 37 singeltons with 4 of them forming 2 groups (1 of them SLV, and the other a DLV). An established MLVA assay, targeting 12 total genes through three separate 4-plex PCRs, was successfully adapted to high resolution melt (HRM) analysis with faster and easier experimental setup; resulting in 58 unique melt curve patterns. HRM-MLVA was capable of differentiating isolates within the same PFGE cluster and having the same ST. Conclusively, combining the three methods PFGE, MLST, and HRM-MLVA, for the phylogenetic analysis of V. parahaemolyticus resulted in a high resolution subtyping scheme for V. parahaemolyticus. This scheme will be useful as a phylogenetic research tool and as an improved method for outbreak investigations for V. parahaemolyticus.",0
"Vaccination is an important strategy for the control and prevention of infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the post-smolt stage in sea-water. In this study, a heterologous gene expression system, based on a replicon construct of salmonid alphavirus (SAV), was used for in vitro and in vivo expression of IPN virus proteins. The large open reading frame of segment A, encoding the polyprotein NH2-pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH, as well as pVP2, were cloned and expressed by the SAV replicon in Chinook salmon embryo cells (CHSE-214) and epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells. The replicon constructs pSAV/polyprotein (pSAV/PP) and pSAV/pVP2 were used to immunize Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) by a single intramuscular injection and tested in a subsequent IPN virus (IPNV) challenge trial. A low to moderate protection against IPN was observed in fish immunized with the replicon vaccine that encoded the pSAV/PP, while the pSAV/pVP2 construct was not found to induce protection.",0
"Diluted bitumen (dilbit; the product of oil sands extraction) is transported through freshwater ecosystems critical to Pacific salmon. This is concerning, because crude oil disrupts cardiac development, morphology, and function in embryonic fish, and cardiac impairment in salmon can have major consequences on migratory success and fitness. The sensitivity of early life-stage salmon to dilbit and its specific cardiotoxic effects are unknown. Sockeye salmon parr were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of dilbit for 1 wk and 4 wk, followed by an examination of molecular, morphological, and organismal endpoints related to cardiotoxicity. We show that parr are sensitive to WSF of dilbit, with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations of 3.5 microg/L sufficient to induce a liver biomarker of PAH exposure, and total PAH of 16.4 microg/L and 66.7 microg/L inducing PAH biomarkers in the heart. Furthermore, WSF of dilbit induces concentration-dependent cardiac remodeling coincident with performance effects: fish exposed to 66.7 microg/L total PAH have relatively fewer myocytes and more collagen in the compact myocardium and impaired swimming performance at 4 wk, whereas the opposite changes occur in fish exposed to 3.5 microg/L total PAH. The results demonstrate cardiac sensitivity to dilbit exposure that could directly impact sockeye migratory success. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:354-360. (c) 2016 SETAC.",1
"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, a widely cultivated marine bivalve mollusc, is becoming a genetically and genomically enabled model for highly fecund marine metazoans with complex life-histories. A genome sequence is available for the Pacific oyster, as are first-generation, low-density, linkage and gene-centromere maps mostly constructed from microsatellite DNA makers. Here, higher density, second-generation, linkage maps are constructed from more than 1100 coding (exonic) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as 66 previously mapped microsatellite DNA markers, all typed in five families of Pacific oysters (nearly 172,000 genotypes). The map comprises 10 linkage groups, as expected, has an average total length of 588 cM, an average marker-spacing of 1.0 cM, and covers 86% of a genome estimated to be 616 cM. All but seven of the mapped SNPs map to 618 genome scaffolds; 260 scaffolds contain two or more mapped SNPs, but for 100 of these scaffolds (38.5%), the contained SNPs map to different linkage groups, suggesting widespread errors in scaffold assemblies. The 100 misassembled scaffolds are significantly longer than those that map to a single linkage group. On the genetic maps, marker orders and intermarker distances vary across families and mapping methods, owing to an abundance of markers segregating from only one parent, to widespread distortions of segregation ratios caused by early mortality, as previously observed for oysters, and to genotyping errors. Maps made from framework markers provide stronger support for marker orders and reasonable map lengths and are used to produce a consensus high-density linkage map containing 656 markers.",0
"Introduction. Non-proteolytic Clostridium botulinum is a major safety hazard for extended shelf life refrigerated foods. Purpose. The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal lethality of products (10 oz. beef meatball trays and 16 oz. salmon fillet trays) processed in a microwave-assisted pasteurization system (MAPS). Methods. Thermal processing parameters were selected to inactivate the spores of C. botulinum Types B and E in beef meatball trays and Type E in salmon filet trays. After a mathematical method was developed to accurately simulate the internal temperature of products, Monte Carlo simulation was used to analyze the lethalities delivered at different processing steps of the pasteurization process. Results. The simulation results showed that the majority of the lethality (63 - 70%) was accumulated in the microwave-assisted heating (MAH) section, while the remaining lethality was completed in the cooling section, suggesting that the cooling section can contribute a significant portion of the lethality. Monte Carlo simulation was also used to analyze the effect of different processing parameters on the total lethality of products. With a target lethality of 6 log-reductions in the spores, more than 98.8% of the processes will achieve a minimum of a 5-log reduction of the spores of C. botulinum Type B in 10 oz. beef meatball trays, and more 98.5% of the processes achieve > 5 log-reductions in the spores of C. botulinum Type E in 16 oz. salmon fillet trays. The results of sensitivity analysis showed that the MAH section is critical to the accumulation of lethality in the products, with the heating temperature being the most sensitive parameter influencing the total lethality, followed by the heating rate and time in this section and the temperature in the pre-heating section. Significance. The results of this study may be used to improve the design and operation of the MAPS.",0
"The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of high-hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on inactivation of human norovirus (HuNoV) in oysters and to evaluate organoleptic characteristics of oysters treated at pressure levels required for HuNoV inactivation. Genogroup I.1 (GI.1) or Genogroup II.4 (GII.4) HuNoV was inoculated into oysters and treated at 300 to 600 MPa at 25 and 0 degrees C for 2 min. After HHP, viral particles were extracted by porcine gastric mucin-conjugated magnetic beads (PGM-MBs) and viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Lower initial temperature (0 degrees C) significantly enhanced HHP inactivation of HuNoV compared to ambient temperature (25 degrees C; P < 0.05). HHP at 350 and 500 MPa at 0 degrees C could achieve more than 4 log10 reduction of GII.4 and GI.1 HuNoV in oysters, respectively. HHP treatments did not significantly change color or texture of oyster tissue. A 1- to 5-scale hedonic sensory evaluation on appearance, aroma, color, and overall acceptability showed that pressure-treated oysters received significantly higher quality scores than the untreated control (P < 0.05). Elevated pressure levels at 450 and 500 MPa did not significantly affect scores compared to 300 MPa at 0 degrees C, indicating increasing pressure level did not affect sensory acceptability of oysters. Oysters treated at 0 degrees C had slightly lower acceptability than the group treated at room temperature on day 1 (P < 0.05), but after 1 wk storage, no significant difference in sensory attributes and consumer desirability was observed (P > 0.05).",0
"We investigated the abundance of total and pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus in shellfish sampled from four provinces in China during May 2013 and March 2014 using the most probable number-polymerase chain reaction (MPN-PCR) method. Total V. parahaemolyticus was detected in 67.7% of 496 samples. A total of 38.1% and 10.1% of samples exceeded 1,000 MPN g(-1) and 10,000 MPN g(-1), respectively. V. parahaemolyticus densities followed a seasonal and geographical trend, with Guangxi and Sichuan shellfish possessing total V. parahaemolyticus levels that were 100-fold higher than those of the Liaoning and Shandong regions. Moreover, the levels of V. parahaemolyticus were at least 10-fold higher in the summer and autumn than in the cooler seasons. Pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus levels were generally lower than total V. parahaemolyticus levels by several log units and tended to be high in samples contaminated with high total V. parahaemolyticus levels. The aqua farms had a lower prevalence but higher abundance of total V. parahaemolyticus compared to retail markets. The catering markets showed the lowest levels of total V. parahaemolyticus, but 20.0% of samples exceeded 1,000 MPN g(-1). The levels of both total and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in oysters were higher than in clams. The log-transformed abundance of V. parahaemolyticus was significantly correlated with both water temperature and air temperature but not water salinity. These results provide baseline contamination data of V. parahaemolyticus in shellfish in China, which can be applied to local risk assessments to prioritize risk control to key sectors and evaluate the effectiveness of future control measures.",0
"Foods and biomaterials are, in general, heterogeneous and it is often a challenge to obtain spectral data which are representative for the chemical composition and distribution. This paper presents a setup for near-infrared (NIR) transmission imaging where the samples are completely trans-illuminated, probing the entire sample. The system measures falling samples at high speed and consists of an NIR imaging scanner covering the spectral range 760-1040 nm and a powerful line light source. The investigated samples were rather big: whole pork bellies of thickness up to 5 cm, salmon fillets with skin, and 3 cm thick model samples of ground pork meat. Partial least square regression models for fat were developed for ground pork and salmon fillet with high correlations (R = 0.98 and R = 0.95, respectively). The regression models were applied at pixel level in the hyperspectral transmission images and resulted in images of fat distribution where also deeply embedded fat clearly contributed to the result. The results suggest that it is possible to use transmission imaging for rapid, nondestructive, and representative sampling of very heterogeneous foods. The proposed system is suitable for industrial use.",0
"The variant muVar of OsHV-1 has been identified as the causative agent of an emerging disease in Europe affecting Crassostrea gigas oysters which has caused significant mortalities in C. gigas oyster stocks in France, Ireland, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy. Microvariants presenting some differences to the variant muVar have also been associated with mortalities in Australia and New Zealand. This study examined 30 Crassostrea gigas production bays in Ireland for the presence of Ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1 and variants) between 2003 and 2012. A retrospective study conducted on archive Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) C. gigas material associated with mortality outbreaks between 2003 and 2008, found no evidence of the OsHV-1 reference type. Molecular analysis using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) real-time PCR specific for the identification of variants presenting the deletion in the microsatellite locus upstream of the ORF4 present in the variant muVar of OsHV-1 found one FFPE sample to be positive from a cohort of C. gigas oysters collected in 2007. Following reports of significant mortalities in three bays in 2008, the variant of OsHV-1, interpreted as the variant muVar was confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis. In 2009, 16 bays had confirmed mortality events associated with the variant interpreted as the variant muVar, and in a separate site the OsHV-1 reference type was also confirmed. By 2012, 29 bays around the Irish coastline were confirmed positive for the presence of the variant interpreted as the variant muVar of OsHV-1. Although the variant muVar was found to be the predominant genotype detected in 29 bays of the 30 bays in the study, co-existence with another genotype close to the variant muVar (with guanidine insertion) was also observed in 6 of these 29 bays. Only one sample consistent with the OsHV-1 reference type (HQ842610) was identified in one oyster producing bay in Ireland in 2009. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Effects of experimental exposure to Alexandrium fundyense, a Paralytic Shellfish Toxin (PST) producer known to affect bivalve physiological condition, upon eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica with a variable natural infestation of the digenetic trematode Bucephalus sp. were determined. After a three-week exposure to cultured A. fundyense or to a control algal treatment with a non-toxic dinoflagellate, adult oysters were assessed for a suite of variables: histopathological condition, hematological variables (total and differential hemocyte counts, morphology), hemocyte functions (Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential), and expression in gills of genes involved in immune responses and cellular protection (MnSOD, CAT, GPX, MT-IV, galectin CvGal) or suspected to be (Dominin, Segon). By comparing individual oysters infested heavily with Bucephalus sp. and uninfested individuals, we found altered gonad and digestive gland tissue and an inflammatory response (increased hemocyte concentration in circulating hemolymph and hemocyte infiltrations in tissues) associated with trematode infestation. Exposure to A. fundyense led to a higher weighted prevalence of infection by the protozoan parasite Perkinsus marinus, responsible for Dermo disease. Additionally, exposure to A. fundyense in trematode-infested oysters was associated with the highest prevalence of P. marinus infection. These observations suggest that the development of P. marinus infection was advanced by A. fundyense exposure, and that, in trematode-infested oysters, P. marinus risk of infection was higher when exposed to A. fundyense. These effects were associated with suppression of the inflammatory response to trematode infestation by A. fundyense exposure. Additionally, the combination of trematode infestation and A. fundyense exposure caused degeneration of adductor muscle fibers, suggesting alteration of valve movements and catch state, which could increase susceptibility to predation. Altogether, these results suggest that exposure of trematode-infested oysters to A. fundyense can lead to overall physiological weakness that decrease oyster defense mechanisms.",1
"In salmonid aquaculture, a variety of technologies have been deployed that attempt to limit a range of environmental impacts associated with net-pen culture. One such technology employs a floating, solid-walled enclosure as the primary culture environment, providing greater potential control over negative interactions with surroundings waters while limiting energy use required for water circulation, thermo-regulation and supplemental oxygen provision. Here, we utilize life cycle assessment to model contributions to a suite of global-scale resource depletion and environmental concerns (including global warming potential, acidification potential, marine eutrophication potential, cumulative energy use, and biotic resource use) of such a technology deployed commercially to rear Chinook salmon in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Results indicate that at full grow-out, feed provisioning and on-site energy use dominate contributions across four of five impact categories assessed. For example, per tonne of salmon harvested, feed contributed approximately 72% to global warming potential, 72% to acidification potential, and accounted for 100% of biotic resource use. However, for both feed and on-site energy use, impacts are heavily influenced by specific sources of inputs; therefore efforts to improve the environmental performance of this technology should focus on reducing these in favor of less impactful alternatives.",0
"Global climate change is expected to have multiple impacts on food and water safety. Knowledge synthesis methods can provide a credible and robust assessment of the evidence on these potential impacts to inform risk assessments. To illustrate the utility of these methods to synthesize data for a case study scenario of one of the potential impacts of climate change on food safety, and to inform a complementary risk assessment model, we conducted a systematic review of the effects of water temperature and salinity on Vibrio parahaemolyticus in raw oysters and harvest waters. We searched four bibliographic databases for literature then two independent reviewers screened 953 citations for relevance and extracted data from 120 relevant articles. Sufficient data for meta-analysis were provided in 19 articles. Random-effects meta-analysis, a quality-of-evidence assessment, and meta-regression (where applicable) were conducted on unique data subsets reporting correlation coefficients for the relationships of interest. A positive correlation was identified between water temperature and V. parahaemolyticus in oysters (r = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.68) and water (r = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.70). However, both analyses were significantly heterogeneous (I2 = 74% and I2 = 75%, respectively), which was not explained by the variables evaluated in meta-regression. No consistent relationship was identified for water salinity. A low and very low quality-of-evidence was identified for the water temperature and salinity relationships, irrespective of sampling media. Due to insufficient reporting and availability, we were unable to perform meta-analysis on regression coefficients for direct inclusion in the risk assessment model. However, the synthesis process provided a structured and transparent evaluation of the evidence to confirm associations between water temperature and V. parahaemolyticus densities, indicate no consistent association between salinity and V. parahaemolyticus densities, and compile available regression coefficients. Future synthesis research could evaluate other effects of climate on food and water safety to inform additional risk assessments. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",1
"Bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum, threatens wild and propagated salmonids worldwide and leads to substantial economic losses. In addition to being horizontally transmitted, F. psychrophilum can be passed from infected parents to their progeny, furthering the negative impacts of this pathogen. In Michigan, both feral and captive salmonid broodstocks are the gamete sources used in fishery propagation efforts. A 5-year study was initiated to follow the prevalence of systemic F. psychrophilum infections in feral broodstocks of four species (steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss [potadromous Rainbow Trout]; Coho Salmon O. kisutch; Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha; and Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar) residing in three Great Lakes watersheds. Additionally, captive broodstocks of four species (Rainbow Trout, Brown Trout Salmo trutta, Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, and Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis) maintained at two facilities were assessed for the presence of F. psychrophilum. The resultant offspring from each broodstock population were sampled for F. psychrophilum infections multiple times throughout hatchery residency. Using selective flavobacterial culture and PCR confirmation, F. psychrophilum was detected in all broodstocks except the captive Lake Trout and Brook Trout. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that among the infected feral broodstocks, Chinook Salmon from the Lake Michigan watershed had the highest prevalence of systemic F. psychrophilum infection (mean = 63.2%). Among the captive broodstocks, the Gilchrist Creek strain of Brown Trout had the highest infection prevalence (mean = 5%). Collectively, the captive broodstocks were found to have significantly lower infection prevalence than the feral broodstocks. Despite the high prevalence of systemic F. psychrophilum infections in many broodstock populations, the bacterium was rarely detected in their progeny during hatchery rearing. However, heavy losses associated with clinical BCWD outbreaks did occur. Collectively, our results reinforce that BCWD continues to threaten Great Lakes basin salmonids.",0
"Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is the main health problem for the salmon industry in Tasmania, Australia and is now reported in most salmon producing countries. Antibody and gene expression responses to the pathogen, Neoparamoeba perurans, have been studied independently following primary exposure; however, the effects of sequential reinfection, which can often occur during net-pen culture of salmon, remain unclear. The association between the transcription of immunoglobulin (Ig) and their systemic and mucosal antibody levels in regards to AGD is unknown. Herein, we assessed the antibody responses as well as Ig transcription in the gills of Atlantic salmon infected only once and also sequentially with N. perurans. After four successive AGD challenges, no significant differences in plasma or skin mucus levels of IgM were observed between AGD-naive and challenged fish. However, IgM gene expression in gill lesions of AGD-affected fish increased up to 31 d after infection, while no changes in IgT, TCR and CD8 transcription were observed. Changes at IgM transcription level did not match the lack of antibody response in mucus, which is possibly explained by weak correlations existing between protein and mRNA abundances in cells and tissues. In the second experiment, which investigated Ig responses to AGD at the transcriptional as well as antibody production level in salmon after a single infection, the levels of serum or skin mucus IgM antibody were not affected and no changes in the IgM or IgT transcription were induced.",1
"Nitric oxide (NO) is a key immune defense agent that is produced from l-arginine in the airways by leukocytes and airway epithelial cells, primarily via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Deficiencies in nasal NO levels have been associated with diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and chronic rhinosinusitis. Herein, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept regarding a potential new therapeutic approach for such disorders. We show that arginine-rich low molecular weight peptides (LMWPs) derived from the FDA-approved protamine (obtained from salmon sperm) are effective at significantly raising NO production in both RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage and LA4 mouse epithelial cell lines. LMWP is produced using a stable, easily produced immobilized thermolysin gel column followed by size-exclusion purification. Monomeric l-arginine induces concentration-dependent increases in NO production in stimulated RAW 264.7 and LA4 cells, as measured by stable nitrite in the cell media. In stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, LMWP significantly increases iNOS expression and total NO production 12-24 h post-treatment compared to cells given equivalent levels of monomeric l-arginine. For stimulated LA4 cells, LMWPs are effective in significantly increasing NO production compared to equivalent l-arginine monomer concentrations over 24 h but do not substantially enhance iNOS expression. The use of the arginase inhibitor S-boronoethyl-l-cysteine in combination with LMWPs results in even higher NO production by stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and LA4 cells. Increases in NO due to LMWPs, compared to l-arginine, occur only after 4 h, which may be due to iNOS elevation rather than increased substrate availability.",0
"Individual-based modeling (IBM) approach combined with the microenvironment modeling of vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon was more effective to describe the variability of the growth of a few Listeria monocytogenes cells contaminating irradiated salmon slices than the traditional population models. The IBM approach was particularly relevant to predict the absence of growth in 25% (5 among 20) of artificially contaminated cold-smoked salmon samples stored at 8 degrees C. These results confirmed similar observations obtained with smear soft cheese (Ferrier et al., 2013). These two different food models were used to compare the IBM/microscale and population/macroscale modeling approaches in more global exposure and risk assessment frameworks taking into account the variability and/or the uncertainty of the factors influencing the growth of L. monocytogenes. We observed that the traditional population models significantly overestimate exposure and risk estimates in comparison to IBM approach when contamination of foods occurs with a low number of cells (<100 per serving). Moreover, the exposure estimates obtained with the population model were characterized by a great uncertainty. The overestimation was mainly linked to the ability of IBM to predict no growth situations rather than the consideration of microscale environment. On the other hand, when the aim of quantitative risk assessment studies is only to assess the relative impact of changes in control measures affecting the growth of foodborne bacteria, the two modeling approach gave similar results and the simplest population approach was suitable.",0
"The T-box transcription factor T-bet is expressed in a number of hematopoietic cell types in mammals and plays an essential role in the lineage determination of Th1 T-helper cells and is considered as an essential feature for both innate and adaptive immune responses in higher vertebrates. In the present study, we have identified and characterized the full-length Atlantic salmon T-bet cDNA (3502 bp). The putative primary structure of the polypeptide deduced from the cDNA sequence contained 612 aa, which possessed a T-box DNA binding domain. Phylogenetic study and gene synteny revealed it is as a homolog to mammalian T-bet. Quantitative PCR analysis of different tissues in healthy fish showed that salmon T-bet gene was highly expressed in spleen, followed by head kidney, and was expressed in intestine, skin, and liver at lower levels. Moreover, the time-dependent expression profile of T-bet, interferon gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin-22 (IL-22), and natural killer enhancement factor in mucosal tissues during water-borne infection with live Aeromonas salmonicida, indicated the involvement of T-bet in mucosal immune response in Atlantic salmon.",0
"This study reports the levels of total arsenic and arsenic species in marine biota such as clams (Meretrix meretrix; N=21) and pearl oyster (Pinctada radiata; N=5) collected from nine costal sites in Jan 2014, and cuttlefish (Sepia pharaonis; N=8), shrimp (Penaeus semisulcatus; N=1), and seven commercially important finfish species (N=23) collected during Apr-May 2013 from seven offshore sites in the western Arabian Gulf. Total As and As species such as dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), arsenobetaine (AB), trimethylarsine oxide (TMAO), arsenocholine (AC), tetramethylarsonium ion (Tetra), arsenosugar-glycerol (As-Gly) and inorganic As (iAs) were determined by using ICPMS and HPLC/ICPMS. In bivalves, the total As concentrations ranged from 16 to 118mg/kg dry mass; the toxic iAs fraction contributed on average less than 0.8% of the total As, while the nontoxic AB fraction formed around 58%. Total As concentrations for the remaining seafood (cuttlefish, shrimp and finfish) ranged from 11 to 134mg/kg dry mass and the iAs and AB fractions contributed on average 0.03% and 81% respectively of the total As. There was no significant relationship between the tissue concentrations of total As and iAs in the samples. There was also no significant relationship between As levels in seafood and geographical location or salinity of the waters from which samples were collected. Based on our results, we recommend introducing a maximum permissible level of arsenic in seafood from the Gulf based on iAs content rather than based on total As. Our analyses of cancer risks and non-cancer hazards identified non-negligible risks and the potential for hazards; the greatest risks were identified for expatriate consumers of bivalves and high-end consumers of seafood. Despite this, many uncertainties remain that would be best addressed by further analyses.",0
"Plastics are persistent synthetic polymers that accumulate as waste in the marine environment. Microplastic (MP) particles are derived from the breakdown of larger debris or can enter the environment as microscopic fragments. Because filter-feeder organisms ingest MP while feeding, they are likely to be impacted by MP pollution. To assess the impact of polystyrene microspheres (micro-PS) on the physiology of the Pacific oyster, adult oysters were experimentally exposed to virgin micro-PS (2 and 6 microm in diameter; 0.023 mg.L(-1)) for 2 mo during a reproductive cycle. Effects were investigated on ecophysiological parameters; cellular, transcriptomic, and proteomic responses; fecundity; and offspring development. Oysters preferentially ingested the 6-microm micro-PS over the 2-microm-diameter particles. Consumption of microalgae and absorption efficiency were significantly higher in exposed oysters, suggesting compensatory and physical effects on both digestive parameters. After 2 mo, exposed oysters had significant decreases in oocyte number (-38%), diameter (-5%), and sperm velocity (-23%). The D-larval yield and larval development of offspring derived from exposed parents decreased by 41% and 18%, respectively, compared with control offspring. Dynamic energy budget modeling, supported by transcriptomic profiles, suggested a significant shift of energy allocation from reproduction to structural growth, and elevated maintenance costs in exposed oysters, which is thought to be caused by interference with energy uptake. Molecular signatures of endocrine disruption were also revealed, but no endocrine disruptors were found in the biological samples. This study provides evidence that micro-PS cause feeding modifications and reproductive disruption in oysters, with significant impacts on offspring.",1
"BACKGROUND: The sea louse is the most economically and environmentally serious ectoparasite of marine salmonids. Sea lice have been largely controlled by treatment with a variety of medicines. In order to understand the sustainability of medicine usage, an analysis of sea louse treatment data has been carried out for all Scottish salmon farms from 2005 to 2011. RESULTS: Overall, there was an increase from 0.156 to 0.282 treatments month(-1) ; treatments could involve one or multiple agents. This increase was mostly in bath treatments (cypermethrin in 2007, largely replaced by deltamethrin and azamethiphos in 2008). Treatments using in-feed treatments (emamectin benzoate and teflubenzuron) increased only slowly. Treatments involving more than one medicine in a single month also increased, as did the probability of follow-up treatments. Treatments were seasonal, with peaks of in-feed treatments in March and August and bath treatments more frequent between August and December. CONCLUSION: Frequency of sea louse treatment increased substantially, with an increase in multiagent and follow-up treatments. This increase in treatment activity is expensive to the industry and increases exposure of the neighbouring environment. This indicates that earlier louse control practices were not sustainable and so adapted.",1
"Noroviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis associated with bivalve shellfish consumption. This study aimed to detect and characterize noroviruses in three bivalve shellfish species: oysters (Saccostrea forskali), cockles (Anadara nodifera), and mussels (Perna viridis). The virus concentration procedure (adsorption-twice elution-extraction) and a molecular method were employed to identify noroviruses in shellfish. RT-nested PCR was able to detect known norovirus GII.4 of 8.8 x 10(-2) genome copies/g of digestive tissues from oyster and cockle concentrates, whereas in mussel concentrates, the positive result was seen at 8.8 x 10(2) copies/g of digestive tissues. From August 2011 to July 2012, a total of 300 shellfish samples, including each of 100 samples from oysters, cockles, and mussels were collected and tested for noroviruses. Norovirus RNA was detected in 12.3 % of shellfish samples. Of the noroviruses, 7.7 % were of the genogroup (G) I, 2.6 % GII, and 2.0 % were mixed GI and GII. The detection rate of norovirus GI was 2.1 times higher than GII. With regards to the different shellfish species, 17 % of the oyster samples were positive, while 14.0 and 6.0 % were positive for noroviruses found in mussels and cockles, respectively. Norovirus contamination in the shellfish occurred throughout the year with the highest peak in September. Seventeen norovirus-positive PCR products were characterized upon a partial sequence analysis of the capsid gene. Based on phylogenetic analysis, five different genotypes of norovirus GI (GI.2, GI.3, GI.4, GI.5, and GI.9) and four different genotypes of GII (GII.1, GII.2, GII.3, and GII.4) were identified. These findings indicate the prevalence and distribution of noroviruses in three shellfish species. The high prevalence of noroviruses in oysters contributes to the optimization of monitoring plans to improve the preventive strategies of acute gastroenteritis.",0
"Two Chlamydiales have previously been found to infect Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), Candidatus Piscichlamydia salmonis and Candidatus Clavichlamydia salmonicola. Both develop intracellularly in cyst-like inclusions in gill cells, generally referred to as epitheliocysts. Here, we present evidence for the association of a novel species of Chlamydiales with epitheliocystis in Atlantic salmon. Based on its partial 16S rRNA gene sequence, it is a new member of the family Simkaniaceae, and a 95.7 % identity to the type species Candidatus Syngnamydia venezia suggests inclusion in the candidate genus Syngnamydia. The presence of the bacterium in epitheliocysts in gills of Atlantic salmon was demonstrated by RNA-RNA hybridization. Ultrastructurally, the novel bacterium produces pleomorphic reticulate bodies and elementary bodies (EBs) with a characteristic morphology. The EBs are short rods with a terminal disc-like cap area, a sub-apical spherical vacuole-like electron-lucent structure and a post-equatorial nucleoid. We propose the name Candidatus Syngnamydia salmonis for this new agent from epitheliocysts in seawater-reared salmon .",1
"Reductions in flesh contaminant concentrations were evaluated in a 36-week feeding trial examining several dietary techniques. Atlantic salmon were fed one of seven dietary treatments for 24 weeks. These diets included a fishmeal, fish oil control diet, an industry control diet, three diets that examined a 75% replacement level of anchovy oil (AO) with flaxseed oil, canola oil and poultry fat, and two diets formulated to be low in contaminants formulated with canola oil, activated carbon-treated anchovy oil and canola protein concentrate or soy protein concentrate. Following this initial 24-week feeding interval, a 12-week finishing diet was utilized to restore the levels of omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFAs). The salmon had marked reductions in their flesh concentrations of total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin-like PCBs and total toxic equivalents by the end of the grow-out phase, but also exhibited significant depressions in their flesh concentrations of n-3 HUFAs relative to 100AO-fed fish. The 12-week finishing diet period was effective in partially re-instating omega-3 levels to those present in the flesh lipids of fish fed 100AO while concurrently maintaining lower flesh contaminant concentrations. 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",0
"Salmon farming is an important economic activity, and employer, particularly for remoter areas of Scotland; crustacean fisheries are also significant small businesses in these areas. Salmon frames (the head and spine that remain after evisceration and filleting) are sometimes used to bait the creel pots used to catch lobsters and crabs. These frames may contain pathogens that could potentially be spread to salmon farms in the vicinity of creel fisheries. Therefore, an analysis has been carried out for key pathogens of farmed salmon to assess the risks associated with this process. Infection of farms via creel bait requires that: (1) pathogens are present in salmon at harvest; (2) they are not removed from the salmon that used for bait during processing; (3) they transmit from creel pot baits to salmon farms. This last step is critical and leads to most of the uncertainty in results. Risk were assessed for 7 viruses, 3 bacteria, and 3 eukaryotic parasites of importance to salmon farming. A potentially significant risk was identified in association with disease control programmes if fish were filleted at a secondary processor; such a situation should arise only rarely. A very low risk, per event, was identified from imports, however, because of large numbers of Norwegian imports processed in the UK this risk is always present. Risks were at worst of low (disease control) or very low (imports) probability and are significant only because of the magnitude of consequences.",1
"BACKGROUND: Methods of stunning used in salmon slaughter are still the subject of research. Fish quality can be influenced by pre-, ante- and post-mortem conditions, including handling before slaughter, slaughter methods and storage conditions. Carbon monoxide (CO) is known to improve colour stability in red muscle and to reduce microbial growth and lipid oxidation in live fish exposed to CO. Quality differences in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., stunned by CO or percussion, were evaluated and compared by different techniques [near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS), electronic nose (EN), electronic tongue (ET)] and sensory analysis. RESULTS: Thawed samples, freeze-dried preparates and NIRS devices proved to be the most efficient combinations for discriminating the treatments applied to salmon, i.e. first the stunning methods adopted, then the back-prediction of the maximum time to reach rigor mortis and finally to correlate some sensory attributes. A trained panel found significant differences between control and CO-stunned salmon: reduced tactile crumbliness, reduced odour and aroma intensities, and reduced tenderness of CO-treated fillets. CO stunning reduced radiation absorbance in spectra of thawed and freeze-dried fillets, but not fillet samples stored in ethanol, where it may have interacted with myoglobin and myosin. CONCLUSIONS: The good results in a rapid discrimination of thawed samples detected by NIRS suggest suitable applications in the fish industry. CO treatment could mitigate sensory perception, but consumer tests are needed to confirm our findings. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",0
"A total of 46 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, 21 parent and 25 alkylated) were determined in seawater, surface sediment and oyster from coastal area of Dalian, North China. The concentration of Sigma46PAHs in seawater, sediment, and oyster were 136-621 ng/L, 172-4700 ng/g dry weight (dw) and 60.0-129 ng/g wet weight (ww) in winter, and 65.0-1130 ng/L, 71.1-1090 ng/g dw and 72.8-216 ng/g ww in summer, respectively. High PAH levels were found in industrial area both in winter and summer. Selected PAH levels in sediments were compared with Sediments Quality Guidelines (ERM-ERL, TEL-PEL indexes) for evaluation probable toxic effects on marine organism and the results indicate that surface sediment from all sampling sites have a low to medium ecotoxicological risk. Daily intake of PAHs via oyster as seafood by humans were estimated and the results indicated that oyster intake would not pose a health risk to humans even 30 days after a oil spill accident near by. Water-sediment exchange analysis showed that, both in winter and summer, the fluxes for most high molecular weight PAHs were from seawater to sediment, while for low molecular weight PAHs, an equilibrium was reached between seawater and sediment.",0
"Five commercial rapid screening methods for Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning were assessed for the analysis of naturally contaminated bivalve mollusc samples from GB. A range of shellfish species including mussels, scallops, clams, oysters and cockles, both positive and negative for domoic acid were assessed, with kit performance measured through comparison with the reference HPLC-UV method. Two lateral flow immunoassays manufactured by Neogen and Scotia Rapid Testing Ltd, were both found to provide a simple and accurate qualitative detection of ASP in shellfish. No false negative or false positive results were returned by either assay. The Scotia method showed the additional advantage of providing a numerical result which was found to correlate well with domoic acid concentration, thus providing a useful additional semi-quantitative aspect to the testing. Three ELISA kits, supplied by Beacon, Biosense and Bioo Scientific were all found to provide a good qualitative indication for the presence of domoic acid. Quantitative results varied between the three assays. The Beacon assay was the only kit to return no false negative results for samples containing domoic acid at concentrations above the maximum permitted regulatory limit of 20 mg/kg, but with, on average, a slight over-estimation of toxin concentrations. Both the Biosense and, more notably, the Bioo Scientific kits tended to under-estimate toxin levels, with both assays also returning false negative results. All methods were relatively straightforward to use, with the lateral flow assays in particular providing a simple and rapid methodology suited to those with no access to laboratory equipment. Whilst the data has provided some evidence for suitability for indicative testing for some species of bivalve shellfish from GB, further work would ideally be required using a larger number of test kit batches on a greater number of samples for any method being utilised safely for routine testing.",0
"Invertebrates typically carry out detoxification of accumulated metals. There is, therefore, no threshold total body concentration of accumulated metal initiating toxicity, the onset of toxic effects rather being related to a critical concentration of metabolically available (MA) accumulated metal. The challenge remains as to whether any particular combination of subcellular fractions of accumulated metal can be identified to represent this theoretical MA component. One candidate combined fraction is the so-termed metal sensitive fraction (MSF), consisting of metal bound to organelles and non-detoxificatory soluble proteins. In this study, we used laboratory zinc accumulation and toxicity data for four populations of the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis with different histories of zinc exposure in the field to address the challenge. We conclude that in a 'control' population of the oyster, the MSF does approximate to the theoretical metabolically available zinc concentration. In populations with a history of field exposure to raised zinc bioavailabilities, however, the MSF would include more zinc detoxified in the lysosome component of organelle-bound metal, and the MSF in such populations would deviate more from the theoretical MA metal concentration.",0
"Parasites of the genus Perkinsus cause high mortality and economic losses in bivalves commonly produced in global aquaculture. Although the immune responses of oysters and clams naturally infected with Perkinsus marinus or Perkinsus olseni have been extensively studied, there is not much information on host response at the early stages of infection. In this study, we analysed how P. olseni influences the gene expression profiles of haemocytes from the Manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum) using temporal experimental infections and an immune-enriched microarray. We identified an early phase of infection that was characterised by no mortality and by the increased expression of genes associated with pathogen recognition, production of nitrogen radicals and antimicrobial activity. Cellular processes such as inhibition of serine proteases and proliferation were also involved in this early response. This phase was followed by an intermediate stage, when the pathogen was most likely multiplying and infecting new areas of the body, and animals began to die. In this stage, many genes related to cell movement were over-expressed. Thirty days after infection metabolic pathway genes were the most affected. Apoptosis appears to be important during pathogenesis. Our results provide novel observations of the broader innate immune response triggered by P. olseni at different infection stages.",0
"Mortality rates of wild Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts implanted with acoustic transmitters were assessed to determine if mortality was size dependent. The routinely accepted, but widely debated, '2% transmitter mass: body mass' rule in biotelemetry was tested by extending the transmitter burden up to 12.7% of body mass in small [mean fork length (LF ) 138.3 mm, range 115-168 mm] downstream migrating S. salar smolts. Over the short timescale of emigration (range 11.9-44.5 days) through the lower river and estuary, mortality was not related to S. salar size, nor was a relationship found between mortality probability and transmitter mass: body mass or transmitter length: LF ratios. This study provides further evidence that smolt migration studies can deviate from the '2% rule' of thumb, to more appropriate study-specific measures, which enables the use of fishes representative of the body size in natural populations without undue effects.",0
"Ocean acidification (OA) has been found to affect an array of normal physiological processes in mollusks, especially posing a significant threat to the fabrication process of mollusk shell. In the current study, the impact of exposure to elevated pCO2 condition was investigated in mantle tissue of Crassostrea gigas by an integrated metabolomic and proteomic approach. Analysis of metabolome and proteome revealed that elevated pCO2 could affect energy metabolism in oyster C. gigas, marked by differentially altered ATP, succinate, MDH, PEPCK and ALDH levels. Moreover, the up-regulated calponin-2, tropomyosins and myosin light chains indicated that elevated pCO2 probably caused disturbances in cytoskeleton structure in mantle tissue of oyster C. gigas. This work demonstrated that a combination of proteomics and metabolomics could provide important insights into the effects of OA at molecular levels.",0
"Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, a relatively rare but life-threatening disease primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the seafood processing industry in the Republic of Ireland. The occurrence of L. monocytogenes was determined by regular sampling of both food samples and processing environment swabs at eight seafood processing facilities over two calendar years. All samples were analyzed by the International Organization for Standardization 11290-1 standard method, and the isolates were characterized by PCR, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, serotyping, and the occurrence of some genes related to survival under stress (SSI-1, Tn6188, and bcrABC). A prevalence of 2.5% in 508 samples (433 environmental swabs and 75 food samples) was found. From the isolates obtained, eight different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles were identified, two occurring in more than one facility and one occurring in food and the environment. Five of the eight pulsotypes identified contained at least one of the three stress survival-related genes tested. The tolerance of the isolates to benzalkonium chloride, a representative quaternary ammonium compound, was also examined and ranged from 5.5 +/- 0.5 to 8.5 +/- 0.5 ppm of benzalkonium chloride. To evaluate the ability of smoked salmon to support the growth of L. monocytogenes, including the T4 widespread pulsotype that was isolated, a challenge test was performed on cold-smoked salmon obtained from two separate producers. The results showed clearly that both types of smoked salmon supported the growth of L. monocytogenes. Although occurrence of L. monocytogenes on seafood was low, this study showed that the smoked salmon used in this study can support the growth of L. monocytogenes; therefore, vigilance is required in the processing facilities to reduce the associated risk.",0
"Interleukin 17 (IL17) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in immune response. Recently, five novel IL17 homologs have been identified by screening and analyzing the genome of pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. In the present study, the functions of CgIL17-5 were investigated by examining the distribution of its mRNA and protein, ligands binding and modulation in immune response. The mRNA expression levels of CgIL17-5 in hemocytes of oysters post twice challenges of Vibrio splendidus were all significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01), while the secondary pathogen infection attenuated the expression level of CgIL17-5 mRNA compared with the primary challenge. CgIL17-5 was found to be located on oyster hemocyte membranes through fluorescence confocal assay. The luciferase reporter assays showed that CgIL17-5 could activate the transfactors NF-kappaB, CREB and ATF-1, and involve in their signal pathways in HEK293T cells. Meanwhile, CgIL17-5 could augment the IL6 synthesis in HuVEC cells, playing the similar roles as human IL17 in inflammatory response. Additionally, the recombinant CgIL17-5 (rCgIL17-5) could directly bind peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), poly (I:C) and beta-1,3-glucan, with the highest affinity to PGN, and significantly inhibit the growth of Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli. All the results collectively suggested that CgIL17-5, as an ancient inflammatory cytokine, could not only activate signal transduction for the release of other cytokines, but also mediate the clearance of extracellular bacteria in oysters.",0
"BACKGROUND: Parvicapsula pseudobranchicola is a marine myxosporean parasite infecting farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A major site for the parasite is the pseudobranch, which may be destroyed in heavily infected fish. Parvicapsulosis may be associated with significant mortality, although the main effect of infections seems to be runting. In situ hybridization (ISH) is, in the absence of specific antibodies, the preferred method for the detection of cell- and tissue tropisms of myxozoans in the early phases of infection of the host, and provides information about the possible association between the pathogen and pathology. A positive diagnosis of parvicapsulosis is based on histopathology and PCR. The aim of the present work was to develop a specific, sensitive and robust ISH assay for the detection of P. pseudobranchicola in tissues. METHODS: The ISH method was designed to specifically target P. pseudobranchicola 18S rDNA/rRNA using a locked nucleic acid (LNA) modified oligonucleotide probe. The method was tested on paraffin embedded P. pseudobranchicola infected pseudobranchs. The infections were confirmed by light microscopy revealing the presence of typical P. pseudobranchicola trophozoites and spores, and the presence of parasite was confirmed with real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Specific regions stained by ISH overlapped well with the parasitized and degenerated regions in neighbouring HE stained sections. No staining was observed in pseudobranchs of Atlantic salmon which had been held in P. pseudobranchicola-free water. CONCLUSIONS: We report here the development of a sensitive ISH assay for the detection of P. pseudobranchicola in paraffin embedded tissue. The technique will be valuable in the study of host entry, early proliferation, pre-spore development, pathology and tissue tropism in Atlantic salmon.",0
"Piscirickettsiosis is the most prevalent salt-water infectious disease in farmed salmonids in Chile. Antimicrobials are used to treat this disease; however, there is growing concern about the poor response to therapeutants on some fish farms. The objective of this study was to assess whether factors such as type of antibiotic used, average fish weight, temperature at the beginning of the treatment, and mortality at the time of treatment administration affect the probability of treatment failure against piscirickettsiosis. Pen-level treatment and production information for the first treatment event from 2014 pens on 118 farms was used in a logistic mixed model to assess treatment failure. We defined a failed treatment as when the average mortality 3 wk after the treatment was above 0.1%. Farm and company were included in the model as random effects. We found that the antibiotic product, mortality level before the treatment, and fish weight at the start of the treatment all had a significant effect on treatment outcome. Our results suggest that antibiotic treatment success is higher if the treatment is administered when mortality associated with piscirickettsiosis is relatively low. We discuss the effect of weight on treatment success and its potential relationships with husbandry practices and drug pharmacokinetics.",0
"The aims of the present study were to obtain the seafood dietary patterns of coastal residents, to determine the concentrations of heavy metals, and to evaluate the possible health risks caused by seafood intake. The daily food intakes of 24 types of seafood were collected from 738 participants from Xiamen, a southern Chinese coastal city, using food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and dietary history method. One hundred and fifty-six samples of 14 types of highest intake seafood were collected from local markets for lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) determination. Health risks via seafood consumption were evaluated by calculating the target hazard quotient (THQ) and the total hazard index (HI) for carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The results showed that the seafood daily intake of Xiamen residents was 61.5 (2.14, 115) g/day. The concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg, and As in seafood were ND-0.45 mg/kg, ND-0.19 mg/kg, ND-0.80 mg/kg, ND-0.70 mg/kg, and 0.32-16.9 mg/kg, respectively. Concentrations of Cd and As in some samples were higher than national limitation standards. Consumption of 14 common types of seafood would not pose non-carcinogenic risk. However, some types, such as sparuslatus, oyster, and porphyra tenera, would form a carcinogenic risk. Regardless of a carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic risk, As posed the highest risk on humans. The observed HI value for non-carcinogenic effect of all metals in all seafood reached 0.69-2.20, and the metal orders of risk can be listed as As > Hg > Cr > Cd > Pb, reiterating the risk of As is a matter of concern in seafood from Xiamen markets.",0
"C-type lectin receptors (CTLRs) play vital roles in immune responses as pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). In this study, we identified a novel C-type lectin receptor (PaCTLRC) gene from ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis. Predicted PaCTLRC is a single transmembrane receptor with a typical carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) at its C-terminus. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that PaCTLRC was most closely related to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) CLRC, but was significantly different from two other ayu CTLRs, aCLR and PaCD209L. PaCTLRC transcript was detected in all tested tissues and cells, with high levels in the liver; and its expression was significantly altered upon Vibrio anguillarum infection. Refolded recombinant PaCTLRC (rPaCTLRC) agglutinated three types of Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus iniae) and four types of Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, V. anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner in vitro, and Gram-positive bacteria were shown to be biologically relevant ligands for PaCTLRC. rPaCTLRC bound to d-mannose, d-galactose, l-fucose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN), exhibiting a relative binding strength to d-mannose and PGN. d-Mannose, l-fucose, GlcNAc, LPS and PGN could inhibit the agglutinating activity of rPaCTLRC, while d-galactose did not functioned. PaCTLRC neutralization using anti-PaCTLRC IgG resulted in the inhibition of phagocytosis by ayu monocytes/macrophages (MO/MPhi) of S. aureus but not of E. coli, and produced a consistently higher survival rate of S. aureus than that of E. coli. d-Mannose, LPS and PGN treatment had no significant influence on the phagocytosis of ayu MO/MPhi. These results suggest that PaCTLRC may serve as a Gram-positive bacteria-preferred PRR which is involved in pathogen recognition and signal transduction in ayu MO/MPhi.",0
"Human antidepressants have been previously shown to induce foot detachment from the substrate in aquatic snails. Prior to foot detachment, antidepressants also affect snail crawling speed. We tested two commonly prescribed antidepressants, venlafaxine (""Effexor"") and fluoxetine (""Prozac"") on crawling speed and time to reach the air-water interface in two species of marine snail, the oyster drill Urosalpinx cinerea and the American starsnail Lithopoma americanum. Exposure to venlafaxine increased crawling speed in both species, while fluoxetine slowed them down. Our lowest LOEC (lowest observed effect concentration) was 31.3 mug/L venlafaxine in Urosalpinx. Similarly, snails (L. americanum) exposed to venlafaxine tended to move faster and more often to the air-water interface, but exposure to fluoxetine slowed them down. Our lowest LOEC was 345 mug/L fluoxetine in Lithopoma. These results indicate that venlafaxine boosts locomotion, while fluoxetine reduces it, and both behaviors are preludes to foot detachment. The different effects of these two antidepressants on snail locomotion suggest differing physiological mechanisms of action in marine snails as well as possible ecological consequences.",0
"The salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis Kroyer, is the major obstacle facing a sustainable future for farmers of salmonids in the North Atlantic Ocean. Medicinal compounds have been the most utilized tool to prevent salmon lice infestation; however, the active compounds have become less effective or considered environmentally unfriendly in the past years. Novel medicinal compounds are thus highly desired. In two experiment series, 26 medicinal compounds were screened for their efficacy against salmon lice, in a 30-min exposure and 24-h exposure, respectively. Pyriprole, imidacloprid, cartap and spinetoram were effective at 50 mg L(-1) in the short-time exposure. In the 24-h exposure, pyriprole, propoxur, cartap, imidacloprid, fenoxycarb, pyriproxyfen, nitenpyram, spinetoram, spiromesifen and diflubenzuron induced a high level of immobilization at 5 mg L(-1) . The EC50 values of the effective compounds were calculated in further titration studies for both exposure periods. Several physiological and biochemical pathways were discovered as possible targets for medicinal intervention against the salmon louse.",0
"Resuspended contaminated sediments represent an important route of contaminant exposure for aquatic organisms. During resuspension events, filter-feeding organisms are exposed to contaminants, in both the dissolved form (at the gills) and the particulate form (in the digestive system). In addition, these organisms must manage the physical stress associated with an increase in total suspended solids (TSS). To date, few studies have experimentally compared the contributions to biological stress of contaminated and clean suspended solids. The authors mixed field-collected sediments (<63 mum) from clean and contaminated field sites to create 4 treatments of increasing metal concentrations. Sydney rock oysters were then exposed to sediment treatments at different TSS concentrations for 4 d, and cellular biomarkers (lysosomal membrane stability, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione) were measured to evaluate sublethal toxicity. Lysosomal membrane stability was the most sensitive biomarker for distinguishing effects from resuspended contaminated sediments, as increasing amounts of contaminated TSS increased lysosomal membrane destabilization. The authors' results illustrate the importance of considering contaminant exposures from resuspended sediments when assessing the toxicity of contaminants to aquatic organisms.",0
"Norovirus (NoV) is one of the most important seafood- and water-borne viruses, and is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks. In the present study we investigated the effect of curcumin as a sensitizer to photodynamic treatment both in buffer and in oysters against murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), a surrogate of NoV. MNV-1 cultured in buffer and MNV-1 bio-accumulated in oysters were irradiated with a novel LED light source with a wavelength of 470nm and an energy of 3.6J/cm(2). Inactivation of MNV-1 was investigated by plaque assays. After virus was extracted from the gut of oysters treated over a range of curcumin concentrations, the ultrastructural morphology of the virus was observed using electron microscopy, and the integrity of viral nucleic acids and stability of viral capsid proteins were also determined. Results showed that the infectivity of MNV-1 was significantly inhibited by 1-3logPFU/ml, with significant damage to viral nucleic acids in a curcumin dose-dependent manner after photodynamic activation. Virus morphology was altered after the photodynamic treatment with curcumin, presumably due to the change of the viral capsid protein structures. The data suggest that treatment of oysters with photodynamic activation of curcumin is a potentially efficacious and cost-effective method to inactivate food-borne NoV. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the toxicology of this approach in detail and perform sensory evaluation of the treated product.",0
"Monitoring the immune response in fish over the progression of a disease is traditionally carried out by experimental infection whereby animals are killed at regular intervals and samples taken. We describe here a novel approach to infectiology for salmonid fish where blood samples are collected repeatedly in a small group of PIT-tagged animals. This approach contributes to the reduction of animals used in research and to improved data quality. Two groups of 12 PIT-tagged Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were i.p infected with Infectious Salmon Anaemia Virus (ISAV) or culture medium and placed in 1 m3 tanks. Blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 21 and 25 days post infection. The viral load, immune and stress response were determined in individual fish by real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) on the blood cells, as well as the haematocrit used as an indicator of haemolysis, a clinical consequence of ISAV infection. ""In-tank"" anaesthesia was used in order to reduce the stress related to chase and netting prior to sampling. The data were analysed using a statistical approach which is novel with respect to its use in fish immunology. The repeated blood collection procedure did not induce stress response as measured by HSP70 and HSP90 gene expression in the un-infected animals. A strong increase in viraemia as well as a significant induction of Mx and gammaIP gene expression were observed in the infected group. Interleukin 10 was found induced at the later stage of the infection whereas no induction of CD8 or gamma IFN could be detected. These results and the advantages of this approach are discussed.",0
"Cryptochromes are flavin- and pterin-containing photoreceptors of the cryptochrome/photolyase family. They play critical roles in organisms, among are which light-dependent and light-independent roles in biological rhythms. The present work aimed at describing a cryptochrome gene in the oyster Crassostrea gigas by (i) a characterization and phylogenetic analysis and (ii) by studying its expression in the relationship to rhythmic valve behavior in different entrainment regimes. Cryptochrome expression was focused on the adductor muscle of the oyster, the effector of the valve behavior. The results suggest involvement of Cgcry1 in oyster rhythmicity as a sensor of environmental zeitgebers, associated with circadian rhythms and potentially to tidal activity. The characterized gene belongs to type 1 cryptochrome/insect-type cry. Additionally, Cgcry1 presented a daily oscillation under L:D entrainment, which disappeared in constant darkness. Transcript expression of Cgcry1 also oscillated at tidal frequency under tidal entrainment and in constant darkness. Finally, exposure of tidally entrained oysters to saxitoxin (STX)-producing alga Alexandrium minutum induced a dose effect response in oysters by first altering Cgcry1 expression and then the behavior of oysters with increasing concentrations of toxins. This study initiates the characterization of the molecular clock in the oyster C. gigas and its interactions with environmental zeitgebers.",0
"Cultured pearls are the product of grafting and rearing of Pinctada margaritifera pearl oysters in their natural environment. Nucleus rejections and oyster mortality appear to result from bacterial infections or from an inappropriate grafting practice. To reduce the impact of bacterial infections, synthetic antibiotics have been applied during the grafting practice. However, the use of such antibiotics presents a number of problems associated with their incomplete biodegradability, limited efficacy in some cases, and an increased risk of selecting for antimicrobial resistant bacteria. We investigated the application of a marine antimicrobial peptide, tachyplesin, which is present in the Japanese horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus, in combination with two marine bacterial exopolymers as alternative treatment agents. In field studies, the combination treatment resulted in a significant reduction in graft failures vs. untreated controls. The combination of tachyplesin (73 mg/L) with two bacterial exopolysaccharides (0.5% w/w) acting as filming agents, reduces graft-associated bacterial contamination. The survival data were similar to that reported for antibiotic treatments. These data suggest that non-antibiotic treatments of pearl oysters may provide an effective means of improving oyster survival following grafting procedures.",0
"The aim of this study was to elucidate how vitamin E (alpha tocopherol) may ameliorate the toxicity of the pesticide chlorpyrifos in Atlantic salmon. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were exposed to vitamin E, chlorpyrifos or a combination of vitamin E and chlorpyrifos (all 100 muM). Transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and metabolomics were used to screen for effects of vitamin E and chlorpyrifos. By introducing vitamin E, the number of upregulated transcripts induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was reduced from 941 to 626, while the number of downregulated transcripts was reduced from 901 to 742 compared to the control. Adding only vitamin E had no effect on the transcriptome. Jak-STAT signaling was the most significantly affected pathway by chlorpyrifos treatment according to the transcriptomics data. The metabolomics data showed that accumulation of multiple long chain fatty acids and dipeptides and amino acids in chlorpyrifos treated cells was partially alleviated by vitamin E treatment. Significant interaction effects between chlorpyrifos and vitamin E were seen for 15 metabolites, including 12 dipeptides. The antioxidant had relatively modest effects on chlorpyrifos-induced oxidative stress. By combining the two data sets, the study suggests that vitamin E supplementation prevents uptake and accumulation of fatty acids, and counteracts inhibited carbohydrate metabolism. Overall, this study shows that vitamin E only to a moderate degree modifies chlorpyrifos toxicity in Atlantic salmon liver cells.",0
"Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is an orthomyxovirus causing high mortality in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The collective data from the Atlantic salmon-ISAV interactions, performed ""in vitro"" using various salmon cell lines and ""in vivo"" fish infected with different ISAV isolates, have shown a strong regulation of immune related transcripts during the infection. Despite this strong defence response, the majority of fish succumb to infections with ISAV. The deficient protection of the host against ISAV is in part due to virulence factors of the virus, which allow evade the host-defence machinery. As such, the viral replication is uninhibited and viral loads quickly spread to several tissues causing massive cellular damage before the host can develop an effective cell-mediated and humoral outcome. To interrogate the correlation of the viral replication with the host defence response, we used fish that have been infected by cohabitation with ISAV-injected salmons. Whole gene expression patterns were measured with RNA-seq using RNA extracted from Head-kidney, Liver and Gills. The results show divergent mRNA abundance of functional modules related to interferon pathway, adaptive/innate immune response and cellular proliferation/differentiation. Furthermore, gene regulation in distinct tissues during the infection process was independently controlled within the each tissue and the observed mRNA expression suggests high modulation of the ISAV-segment transcription. Importantly this is the first time that strong correlations between functional modules containing significant immune process with protein-protein affinities and viral-segment transcription have been made between different tissues of ISAV-infected fish.",0
"The importance of proinflamatory cytokines and acute phase proteins in pathogenesis and progression of MM is well known. However, there are any studies evaluating the role of NT-proCN in management and treatment of MM. The aim of our study was to evaluate the concentration of NT-proCNP and acute phase proteins in patients with MM before and after stem cell transplantation. We involved 40 newly diagnosed MM patients in stage III according to the Durie-Salmon classification and treated with high dose of melphalan (200mg/m2) prior to ASCT. Concentration of NT-proCNP, hs-CRP and SAA were measured before conditioning treatment and every 4days until the 24th day after stem cell infusion. We observed low NT-proCNP levels before conditioning treatment (0.121+/-0.04pmol/l), the higher in day on ASCT (0.28+/-0.14pmol/l). Further we showed significant gradual increase concentration of NT-proCNP up to 12days after stem cells infusion (1.07+/-0.72pmol/l). The kinetics of hs-CRP and SAA levels were similar to NT-proCNP. We showed positive correlation between NT-proCNP levels and absolute neutrophil and platelets count in patients after ASCT. NT-proCNP can be useful parameter to assess effectiveness of treatment and monitoring of hematopoetic recovery time in patients with MM after stem cell transplantations.",0
"Apex marine predators alter their foraging behavior in response to spatial and/or seasonal changes in natural prey distribution and abundance. However, few studies have identified the impacts of aquaculture that represents a spatially and temporally predictable and abundant resource on their foraging behavior. Using satellite telemetry and stable isotope analysis we examined the degree of spatial overlap between the South American sea lion (SASL) and salmon farms, and quantify the amount of native prey versus farmed salmonids in SASL diets. We instrumented eight SASL individuals with SRDL-GPS tags. Vibrissae, hair and skin samples were collected for delta13C and delta15N analyses from five of the tagged individuals and from four males captured in a haul-out located adjacent to salmon farms. Tracking results showed that almost all the foraging areas of SASL are within close proximity to salmon farms. The most important prey for the individuals analyzed was farmed salmonids, with an estimated median (+/-SD) contribution of 19.7 +/- 13.5 per thousand and 15.3 +/- 9.6 per thousand for hair and skin, respectively. Using vibrissae as a temporal record of diet for each individual, we observed a remarkable switch in diet composition in two SASL, from farmed salmonids to pelagic fishes, which coincided with the decrease of salmon production due to the infectious salmon anemia virus that affected salmon farms in Chile at the end of 2008. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of integrating stable isotope derived dietary data with movement patterns to characterize the impacts of a non-native prey on the foraging ecology of an apex marine predator, providing important applied implications in situations where interactions between aquaculture and wildlife are common.",0
"Bivalves are animals with worldwide distribution. Although they play key roles in economic activities, human feeding and environmental studies, there is a considerable lack of knowledge about the relationship between their immune system and antioxidant defenses. Here, we performed an in vitro experiment where Crassostrea gigas hemocytes were exposed to the electrophilic compound 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB, 0.1-50 muM) for one hour. CDNB treatment clearly disturbed thiol homeostasis, causing a concentration-dependent decrease in the glutathione (GSH) content and a decrease in the activity of two thiol reductases, glutathione reductase (GR - 2.5 and 50 muM CDNB) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR - only 50 muM CDNB). The MTT reduction assay showed that none of the CDNB concentrations tested significantly altered cell viability. However, there was a decrease in the hemocyte's ability to uptake the neutral red dye, which indicates lysosomal impairment (>/=12.5 muM CDNB). Cellular immunocompetence was further investigated and, despite the lower GSH content, GR activity and impairment in lysosome integrity, hemocyte functions (adhesion capacity, phagocytosis of latex beads and laminarin-induced ROS production) were preserved in the 2.5 and 12.5 muM CDNB treatments. These results suggest a minor importance of thiol pools and GR activity in C. gigas hemocyte's immunocompetence, in an in vitro acute exposure model. The 50 muM CDNB treatment, however, significantly compromised all the measured hemocyte functions. This response was associated with TrxR inhibition, increased lysosome impairment, decreased GSH content, and lower GR activity. Therefore, it seems that TrxR may be particularly important for the hemocyte function, or, alternatively, it is only affected when a deeply aggravated scenario in thiol homeostasis is set up. Such findings point out the need for further studies towards a better understanding of antioxidant and immune defenses interactions in bivalve cellular systems.",0
"A new, image-based, tritiated ligand technique for measuring cardiac beta2 -adrenoceptor (beta2 -AR) binding characteristics was developed and validated with adult rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss hearts so that the tissue limitation of traditional receptor binding techniques could be overcome and measurements could be made in hearts nearly 14-times smaller than previously used. The myocardial cell-surface (functional) beta2 -AR density of O. nerka smolts sampled at the headwaters of the Chilko River was 54.2 fmol mg protein(-1) and about half of that previously found in return migrating adults of the same population, but still more than twice that of adult hatchery O. mykiss (21.1 fmol mg protein(-1) ). This technique now opens the possibility of investigating cardiac receptor density in a much wider range of fish species and life stages.",0
"The year-round presence of ovigerous females of the parasite Caligus rogercresseyi in the fish farms of southern Chile results in a continuous source of the copepodid (infestive) stage of this louse. The short generation time in spring-summer could lead to high abundances of this copepodid, potentially leading to high infestation levels for fish. Knowing how heavy lice infestations affect Salmo salar can help determine how to time antiparasitic treatments so as to both minimize the treatment impact and reduce lice infestation levels for fish. This study aimed to describe the effects of high infestations of the copepodid stage of C. rogercresseyi on the physiology of S. salar. Two groups of S. salar were used: an infested group (75 copepodids per fish) and a control group (not infested). Sixty-five days after the first infestation, the infested fish group was re-infested at an infestation pressure of 200 copepodids per fish. Sampling was done prior to and following the second infestation, at 56 and 67 days (the latter 2 days following the second infestation). Several physiological variables were measured: cortisol (primary stress response) and glucose, proteins, amino acids, triglycerides, lactate, osmolality levels, and number and diameter of skin mucous cells (secondary stress responses). The plasma cortisol, glucose, and triglyceride levels were altered in the heavily infested fish, as was the diameter of skin mucous cells. These results suggest that heavy infestations of C. rogercresseyi lead to an acute stress response, metabolic reorganization, and increased mucus production in S. salar under heavy infestation conditions.",0
"Recently, the problem of heavy metal pollution has attracted many attentions in global scale. The problem of heavy metal contamination in fresh and processing shellfish products is urgently to be solved due to their strong ability of heavy metal enrichment. As the only existing natural alkaline polysaccharide, chitosan has strong ability of heavy metal chelating. In this paper, the molecular structure characteristics and adsorbent mechanism of chitosan in absorbing and removing heavy metals are analyzed. The importance of biological adsorbent on the removal of heavy metals was discussed in this paper. It was investigated of chitosan on heavy metals removal for economic shellfish products, such as oysters and scallop. Finally, considering the industry and cost requirements, suggestions for the future research on the topic of heavy metal removal from shellfish are proposed.",0
"One paradigm of oysters as the hyper-accumulators of many toxic metals is the inter-individual variation of metals, but the molecular mechanisms remain very elusive. A comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome of Crassostrea angulata was conducted to reveal the relationship between gene expression and differential Cu body burden in oysters. Gene ontology analysis for the differentially expressed genes showed that the neurotransmitter transporter might affect the oyster behavior, which in turn led to difference in Cu accumulation. The ATP-binding cassette transporters superfamily played an important role in the maintenance of cell Cu homeostasis, vitellogenin and apolipophorin transport, and elimination of excess Cu. Gill and mantle Cu concentrations were significantly reduced after silencing the GABA transporter 2 (GAT2) gene, but increased after the injection of GABA receptor antagonists, suggesting that the function of GABA transporter 2 gene was strongly related to Cu accumulation. These findings demonstrated that GABA transporter can control the action of transmitter GABA in the nervous system, thereby affecting the Cu accumulation in the gills and mantles.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To quantify Vibrio parahaemolyticus densities in American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) under cold storage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 320 oysters were stored at 7 degrees C for nine days and total and pathogenic densities were determined by the NMP-PCR methodology. RESULTS: V. parahaemolyticus tlh+ densities were observed on 0,3, and 6 days of storage at 1.134, 2.764 and 0.785 log10NMP/g, respectively, and pathogenic density trh+ on 0 and 3 days at 0.477 and 0.519 log10NMP/g, respectively; the pathogenic densities tdh+ (0.519 log10NMP/g), tdh+/trh+ (0.519 log10NMP/g), and tdh+orf8+ (-0.444 log10NMP/g) were detected on day 3 of storage. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that V. parahaemolyticus growth and pathogenic genes occurrence at 7 degrees C involve changes in the genetic expression as a cold shock response, favoring V. parahaemolyticus survival and virulence, representing a health risk.",0
"In order to provide a theoretical foundation for the thermal sterilization of cold smoked salmon, the influence of heat treatments on the inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes and the changes in the quality of cold smoked salmon were investigated. A sample of cold smoked salmon inoculated with a strain of L. monocytogenes (ATCC19113) was sealed in a capillary tube, and subjected to heat treatment at 58 √ÅC, 60√ÅC, 62 √ÅC, 64√ÅC, and 66 √ÅC for 18 min, 8.8 min, 4 min, 2 min, and 1 min, respectively. The changes in viable bacterial cell count at the different temperatures was monitored. Small samples (D 30 mm * H 6 mm) were sealed in an aluminium heating unit (D 35 mm * H 6 mm) and heated in a water bath at 50√ÅC, 57√ÅC, 64√ÅC, and 70√ÅC for 120 min, 90 min, 60 min, and 40 min, respectively. The corresponding changes in quality were studied. The results showed that the inactivation curve exhibited a logarithmic linear relationship (R2 = 0.94). The quality indexes of cold smoked salmon, including cooking loss, the a* value, b* value, and the shear force followed first-order reaction kinetics, while the L*value followed zero-order reaction kinetics. As the a* value of cold smoked salmon was closely linked to thermal inactivation of L. monocytogenes, the overlapping region between thermal-death-time curves of L. monocytogenes (ATCC19113) and the a* quality deterioration curve was the operational range to carry out the combination of temperature and heat treatment time, which could meet the requirements for sterilization without deteriorating quality of cold smoked salmon.",0
"Introduction. Vibrio parahaemolyticusis recognized as a marine seafood-borne pathogen that occurs globally and causes gastrointestinal and immunological disorders in humans. Like other Vibrio, it can form biofilms through bacterial attachment to surfaces,which is recognized as a vital characteristic of the microorganism, and it can attach on various sources of organic and inorganic matter and form biofilms on them. Purpose. We investigated the correlation of variability of biofilm, quorum sensing and motility of 22 strains of V. parahaemolyticus on the stainless steel (SS) surface. Methods. Biofilm formation index (BFI) assay, motility assay, autoinducer 2 (AI-2) assay, exoprotease assay and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis were used as the indexes to determine any correlation between biofilm formation and motility/quorumsensing of V. parahaemolyticus on stainless steel surface. The student t-test was used to analyze for Pearson correlation between two indexes. Results. The strains VP 4 (oyster isolates), VP 9 (warty squid isolates) and VP 13 (mussel isolates) were highest biofilm former among 22 strains of V. parahaemolyticus based on the BFI and FESEM. The swimming motility showed positive correlation (39.5%) with the formation of biofilm than swarming motility (-0.12%) in varieties of V. parahaemolyticus strains. The biofilm forming ability of V. parahaemolyticus strains was dependent on quorum sensing. We observed 72.8% positive correlation between SS biofilm and AI-2 and 60.6% positive correlation between SS biofilm and exoprotease production. Significance. This study found that the biofilm forming ability of V. parahaemolyticus strains was dependent on quorum sensing and motility. These findings afford useful information in understanding of strain variability, besides in strain selection for exploitation in the context of food safety challenge and to determine the ability to form biofilms. These insights in biofilm formation features will permit us to further optimize approaches to control the biofilm formation of V. Parahaemolyticus.",0
"OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of oysters to trap and maintain viable Cryptosporidium oocysts, and the feasibility of Cryptosporidium multiplication in oysters' organs. METHODS: Seventy oysters were raised in experimentally seeded natural seawater for up to 3 months, with weekly oocysts inoculations. Cryptosporidium oocysts, viable and non-viable, as well as other stages were detected using two immunofluorescence vital staining techniques (Sporo-Glo and Merifluor((R))) with confocal microscopy. Viability rate at various times after inoculations were calculated. RESULTS: Cryptosporidium oocysts were found most concentrated in oysters' digestive organs than in gill and water inside the oysters. Oocysts numbers were 857.33 at 24 h after inoculation and strikingly decreased to 243.00 and 126.67 oocysts at 72 h and 7 days, respectively. The oocysts in oyster were also less viable over time; 70%, 60% and 30% viable at 24 h, 72 h and 7 days after inoculation, respectively. At 77 days, the number of oocysts was very low and none was found at 84 days onwards. Although some oocysts were ruptured with released sporozoites, there was no evidence throughout the study of sporozoites multiplication to indicate that oyster is a biological host. Despite the significant reduction in oocysts number after 7 days of inoculation, the remained viable oocysts can still cause cryptosporidiosis. CONCLUSION: The findings confirm that Cryptosporidium parvum does not multiply in oyster, and is therefore not a biological host. Nevertheless, the results suggest that oyster can be an effective transmission vehicle for Cryptosporidium oocysts, especially within 24-72 h of contamination, with viable oocysts present at up to 7 days post infection. Unless consuming well-cooked oyster dishes, eating raw oyster remains a public health concern and at least 3 days of depuration in clean sea water prior to consumption is recommended.",0
"Advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), a pathogenic factor implicated in diabetes and other chronic diseases, are produced in cooked meat products. The objective of this study was to determine the AGE content, as measured by Nepsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML) levels, in cooked chicken, pork, beef and fish (salmon and tilapia) prepared by three common cooking methods used by U.S. consumers: frying, baking, and broiling. The CML was detected in all the cooked samples, but the levels were dependent on types of meat, cooking conditions, and the final internal temperature. Broiling and frying at higher cooking temperature produced higher levels of CML, and broiled beef contained the highest CML content (21.8mug/g). Baked salmon (8.6mug/g) and baked tilapia (9.7mug/g) contained less CML as compared to the other muscle food samples.",0
"Yersinia ruckeri is a ubiquitous pathogen of finfish capable of causing major mortalities in farmed fish stocks. It can be transmitted vertically from parent to progeny as well as horizontally in the water column from both clinically infected fish and asymptomatic carriers, and is consequently capable of infecting fish at early stages of development. Immunisation strategies that can protect small fry are therefore critical for the effective management of fish health, as is the ability to detect covertly infected fish. In this study, first-feeding Atlantic salmon fry (<0.5 g) were immunised either by oral administration of a microencapsulated Y. ruckeri vaccine formulation (0.38 g initial weight), or via immersion in bacterin suspension (0.26 g), with and without a booster immersion vaccination at 1g size. Protection in groups receiving only immersion immunisation did not differ significantly from untreated controls when challenged with Y. ruckeri at approximately 5 g size, while orally immunised fish were significantly better protected than untreated controls (F=4.38, df=4,10, P=0.026), with RPS varying between 29.4% (ORAL) and 51% (ORAL+DIP). A quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to successfully detect covertly infected fish among challenge survivors, indicating more than 50% of surviving fish in each group were infected with no significant differences between immunised fish and untreated controls.",0
"Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the causative agent of bacterial cold water disease and rainbow trout fry mortality syndrome in salmonid fishes and is associated with significant losses in the aquaculture industry. The virulence factors and molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis of F. psychrophilum are poorly understood. Moreover, at the present time, there are no effective vaccines and control using antimicrobial agents is problematic due to growing antimicrobial resistance and the fact that sick fish don't eat. In the hopes of identifying vaccine and therapeutic targets, we sequenced the genome of the type strain ATCC 49418 which was isolated from the kidney of a Coho salmon (Oncorhychus kisutch) in Washington State (U.S.A.) in 1989. The genome is 2,715,909 bp with a G+C content of 32.75%. It contains 6 rRNA operons, 49 tRNA genes, and is predicted to encode 2,329 proteins.",1
"Controlling infestations of copepodid ectoparasites in the salmon industry is increasingly problematic given higher instances of drug resistance or loss of sensitivity. Despite the importance of this issue, the molecular mechanisms and genes implicated in resistance/susceptibility are only scarcely understood. The objective of the present study was to identify and evaluate the expression levels of candidate genes associated with delousing drug response in the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi. From RNA-seq data obtained for adult male and female sea lice, 62.48 M reads were assembled in 70,349 high-quality contigs. BLASTX analysis against UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot and the ESTs available for crustaceans in the NCBI database identified 870 transcripts previously related to genes associated with delousing drug response. Furthermore, 14 candidate genes were validated through RT-qPCR and were evaluated with deltamethrin and azamethiphos bioassays. The results evidenced an overregulation of genes involved in ion transport in salmon lice treated with deltamethrin, while those treated with azamethiphos evidenced an overregulation of genes such as cytochrome P450, Carboxylesterase, and acetylcholine receptors. The present study provides a multigene panel to test delousing drug response to pyrethroids and organophosphates in a highly prevalent pathogen of the Chilean salmon industry.",0
"Protozoan pathogens represent a serious threat to oyster aquaculture, since they can lead to significant production loses. Moreover, oysters can concentrate human pathogens through filter feeding, thus putting at risk raw oyster consumers' health. Using PCR-based assays in oysters (Crassostrea virginica) from Maine, we expand the Northeast range in the USA for the protozoans Perkinsus marinus, Perkinsus chesapeaki, and Haplosporidium nelsoni, and report for the first time the detection of the human pathogens Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum. Oysters hosting both P. marinus and P. chesapeaki were more than three times as likely to be infected by a non-Perkinsus than those free of Perkinsus infections.",1
"The Muchalat Inlet, British Columbia, is among the most westerly points at which aquaculture is practiced in Canada. In this paper, we summarise data from over 18000 wild fish sampled at 16 sites over an 8 yr period, between 2004 and 2011. The most prevalent wild species was chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta (82.4%), followed by Chinook O. tshawytscha (10%) and coho O. kisutch (4.3%). However, inter-annual and seasonal variation was evident, and smaller numbers of other Pacific salmon and stickleback species were sporadically observed. A high percentage of wild salmon (~95%) had no sea lice parasites present, with less than 1% of the fish hosting a mobile-stage sea louse. Of the data for which sea lice species were recorded, just over 96% of samples were identified as Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Logistic regression models assessed the association between the presence of lice and a range of independent variables. These models indicated a significant degree of spatial variation, much of which could be explained in terms of salinity levels. There were also important variations through time, both over the season within a year and across years. In addition, coho salmon were significantly more likely (odds ratio = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.20-2.3) to be infected than chum salmon. The protective effect of low salinity was most clearly seen at values lower than 15 psu, although this was dependent on fish species.",0
"BACKGROUND: The principal sources of medical collagen are pork, calf skin and bone. There are now more studies on a much safer, alternative source of active collagen, mainly from aquatic life. Active collagen and its peptides FCP (fish collagen peptides) have already been extracted from the skin of salmon, cobia, hoki, tilapia, zebrafish, ling, shark, silver carp and also jellyfish. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of fish collagen on human fibroblasts from gingiva. The cytotoxicity of the new formulation and induction of endogenous collagen was estimated by means of the collagen derived from fish skin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fish collagen was extracted from the skin of silver carp at 16 degrees Celsius. To compare the biocompatibility and endogenous collagen production Geistlich Bio-Gide(R) membrane was ordered in Geistlich Biomaterials (Geistich AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland). The culture of human fibroblasts was performed acc. to Saczko et al. The fibroblasts were treated 96 hours with 1.0%, 0.5% and 0.1% experimental collagen formulation to induce endogenous collagen production. The Sircol collagen assay was done to measure amount of collagen. Cell viability was assessed by measuring mitochondrial activity in MTT assay after 24 h followed by 24 h of incubation with experimental collagen formulation. Qualitative analysis was performed by immunocytochemically staining of collagen type I and III. RESULTS: Preparations of fish collagen are not cytotoxic at concentrations below 1%. Cells cultured in the presence of this product are characterized by a large number of endogenous collagen, which is comparable to the control. In case of porcine collagen membrane was noticed decreased to 83% production of endogenous collagen and reduction of cell viability to 69%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that experimental fish collagen is an innovative product which may induce expression of endogenous collagen in fibroblasts.",0
"More and more infectious diseases affect marine molluscs. Some diseases have impacted commercial species including MSX and Dermo of the eastern oyster, QPX of hard clams, withering syndrome of abalone and ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) infections of many molluscs. Although the exact transmission mechanisms are not well understood, human activities and associated environmental changes often correlate with increased disease prevalence. For instance, hatcheries and large-scale aquaculture create high host densities, which, along with increasing ocean temperature, might have contributed to OsHV-1 epizootics in scallops and oysters. A key to understanding linkages between the environment and disease is to understand how the environment affects the host immune system. Although we might be tempted to downplay the role of immunity in invertebrates, recent advances in genomics have provided insights into host and parasite genomes and revealed surprisingly sophisticated innate immune systems in molluscs. All major innate immune pathways are found in molluscs with many immune receptors, regulators and effectors expanded. The expanded gene families provide great diversity and complexity in innate immune response, which may be key to mollusc's defence against diverse pathogens in the absence of adaptive immunity. Further advances in host and parasite genomics should improve our understanding of genetic variation in parasite virulence and host disease resistance.",1
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the most prevalent gastroenteritis-causing pathogen in Korea and in some other Asian countries. It is frequently found in oysters and other seafood. This study monitored changes in the prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus and environmental parameters in oyster aquaculture environments in Korea. From June to October 2014, we tested oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from shellfish-harvesting areas off the west coast of Korea. These 71 isolates were the sum of 16 (22.5%), 19 (26.8%), 23 (32.4%), and 13 (18.3%) isolates collected in July, August, September, and October, respectively. These 71 isolates had the following profiles of resistance against 16 antibiotics: all isolates were resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin, and 52.2, 50.7, and 50.7% of isolates exhibited resistance to cephalothin, rifampin, and streptomycin, respectively. PCR analysis for the presence of the species-specific toxR gene confirmed that 38 (53.5%) of the total 71 isolated strains were positive for V. parahaemolyticus. In PCR analysis for virulence of V. parahaemolyticus, of the 71 isolates tested in the present study, only 38 (53.5%) were positive for the trh virulence gene and 71 (100%) was negative for the tdh virulence gene.",0
"Diseases which cause skeletal muscle myopathy are some of the most economically damaging diseases in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., aquaculture. Despite this, there are limited means of assessing fish health non-destructively. Previous investigation of the serum proteome of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., during pancreas disease (PD) has identified proteins in serum that have potential as biomarkers of the disease. Amongst these proteins, the enzyme enolase was selected as the most viable for use as a biomarker of muscle myopathy associated with PD. Western blot and immunoassay (ELISA) validated enolase as a biomarker for PD, whilst immunohistochemistry identified white muscle as the source of enolase. Enolase was shown to be a specific marker for white muscle myopathy in salmon, rising in serum concentration significantly correlating with pathological damage to the tissue.",0
"Cysts of the protozoan parasite Giardia have been detected in many bivalve shellfish species worldwide. The detection of zoonotic Giardia duodenalis assemblages A and B is of public health concern, yet there is limited data available demonstrating the bioaccumulation and elimination of Giardia cysts in bivalve shellfish. This study quantified G. duodenalis cysts that were filtered and retained by oysters (Crassostrea virginica) over a one week chronic exposure period, or 24 hour exposure followed by a 6 day depuration period, using static tank systems containing 10 L of 29 ppt water inoculated with 1000 or 10,000 cysts. Under chronic exposure, each oyster retained a mean of 13.4 and 87.4 cysts during the first 24h of exposure at low and high doses, respectively, and the cysts bioaccumulated at a rate of 1.2 and 6.8 cysts/oyster/day, respectively, for the remaining duration of the trials. In acute exposure trials, oysters retained 13.8 cysts or 78.9 cysts at low and high doses, respectively, during the initial 24 hour exposure and naturally depurated cysts at a rate of -0.92 cysts/oyster/day and -2.2 cysts/oyster/day, respectively, after transfer. Although most G. duodenalis cysts were eliminated within the first 24h via pseudofeces and feces, detection of some cysts in the fecal material on day 7 of acute exposure trials was indicative of cysts which passed through the digestive tract and released in feces. Only 48-53% of the initial tank inocula were recovered and may indicate that some cysts were selectively filtered by oysters but degraded through digestion.",0
"BACKGROUND: We previously reported that fish proteins can alleviate metabolic syndrome (MetS) in obese animals and human subjects. OBJECTIVES: We tested whether a salmon peptide fraction (SPF) could improve MetS in mice and explored potential mechanisms of action. METHODS: ApoB(100) only, LDL receptor knockout male mice (LDLR(-/-)/ApoB(100/100)) were fed a high-fat and -sucrose (HFS) diet (25 g/kg sucrose). Two groups were fed 10 g/kg casein hydrolysate (HFS), and 1 group was additionally fed 4.35 g/kg fish oil (FO; HFS+FO). Two other groups were fed 10 g SPF/kg (HFS+SPF), and 1 group was additionally fed 4.35 g FO/kg (HFS+SPF+FO). A fifth (reference) group was fed a standard feed pellet diet. We assessed the impact of dietary treatments on glucose tolerance, adipose tissue inflammation, lipid homeostasis, and hepatic insulin signaling. The effects of SPF on glucose uptake, hepatic glucose production, and inducible nitric oxide synthase activity were further studied in vitro with the use of L6 myocytes, FAO hepatocytes, and J774 macrophages. RESULTS: Mice fed HFS+SPF or HFS+SPF+FO diets had lower body weight (protein effect, P = 0.024), feed efficiency (protein effect, P = 0.018), and liver weight (protein effect, P = 0.003) as well as lower concentrations of adipose tissue cytokines and chemokines (protein effect, P </= 0.003) compared with HFS and HFS+FO groups. They also had greater glucose tolerance (protein effect, P < 0.001), lower activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/S6 kinase 1/insulin receptor substrate 1 (mTORC1/S6K1/IRS1) pathway, and increased insulin signaling in liver compared with the HFS and HFS+FO groups. The HFS+FO, HFS+SPF, and HFS+SPF+FO groups had lower plasma triglycerides (protein effect, P = 0.003; lipid effect, P = 0.002) than did the HFS group. SPF increased glucose uptake and decreased HGP and iNOS activation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: SPF reduces obesity-linked MetS features in LDLR(-/-)/ApoB(100/100) mice. The anti-inflammatory and glucoregulatory properties of SPF were confirmed in L6 myocytes, FAO hepatocytes, and J774 macrophages.",0
"Genitors of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas were submitted during gametogenesis to a short pulse exposure to the herbicide diuron at a realistic environmental concentration. Histological analysis showed no effect of diuron on gametogenesis course, sex ratio and reproductive effort. A non-significant increase in testosterone and progesterone levels was observed in genitors exposed to the herbicide. At cell level, diuron exposure was shown to modulate the phagocytic activity of circulating hemocytes. The results of a transcriptional analysis showed that diuron affected the expression of genes belonging to functions known to play a major role during oyster gametogenesis such as gene transcription regulation, DNA replication and repair, DNA methylation and cytokinesis. Taking into account the results we previously obtained on the same genitors, this study showed a negative effect of diuron on oyster reproduction by inducing both structural and functional modifications of the DNA.",0
"Pacific salmon are a dominant component of the northeast Pacific ecosystem. Their status is of concern because salmon abundance is highly variable--including protected stocks, a recently closed fishery, and actively managed fisheries that provide substantial ecosystem services. Variable ocean conditions, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), have influenced these fisheries, while diminished diversity of freshwater habitats have increased variability via the portfolio effect. We address the question of how recent changes in ocean conditions will affect populations of two salmon species. Since the 1980s, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have been more frequently associated with central tropical Pacific warming (CPW) rather than the canonical eastern Pacific warming ENSO (EPW). CPW is linked to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), whereas EPW is linked to the PDO, different indicators of northeast Pacific Ocean ecosystem productivity. Here we show that both coho and Chinook salmon survival rates along western North America indicate that the NPGO, rather than the PDO, explains salmon survival since the 1980s. The observed increase in NPGO variance in recent decades was accompanied by an increase in coherence of local survival rates of these two species, increasing salmon variability via the portfolio effect. Such increases in coherence among salmon stocks are usually attributed to controllable freshwater influences such as hatcheries and habitat degradation, but the unknown mechanism underlying the ocean climate effect identified here is not directly subject to management actions.",1
"Since 2008, mass mortality outbreaks have been reported in all French regions producing Pacific oysters, and in several Member States of the European Union. These mass mortality events of Pacific oysters are related to OsHV-1 infection. They occur during spring and summer periods leaving suspect the quality of the marine environment and the role of seasonal use of pesticides associated with the arrival of freshwater in oyster rearing areas. Pesticides have been also detected in French coastal waters, especially in areas of oyster production. Using PMA real-time PCR we showed that a mixture of 14 pesticides has no effect on the integrity of virus capsids from viral suspension in the conditions tested. A contact of oysters with this pesticide mixture was related to higher mortality rates among experimentally infected animals in comparison with control ones (no previous pesticide exposure before experimental infection). We therefore suggest that pesticides at realistic concentration can exert adverse effects on Pacific oysters and causes an increased susceptibility to the viral infection in experimental conditions.",0
"A headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME GC-MS) method is described, to screen seafood for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated with petrochemical taint. VOCs are extracted from the headspace of heated sample homogenates by adsorption onto a SPME fiber and desorbed for analysis by GC-MS. Targeted compounds are determined semi-quantitatively using representative calibration standards for the various classes (alkanes, alkylbenzenes, indanes/tetralins, and naphthalenes) of VOCs analyzed. Sample preparation is minimal, and the analyses are rapid and automated with a capacity of 50 samples per day. The method was optimized in terms of headspace temperature, sample heating time, extraction time, and desorption time using oyster samples fortified with target compounds. Calibrations for hydrocarbon components were linear in the range of 8.3-167 ng/g; the limit of detection ranged between 0.05 and 0.21 ng/g, and the limit of quantitation between 0.16 and 0.69 ng/g. Good precision (RSD < 10 % at 16.7 ng/g for individual VOCs) and accuracy (recovery range 89-118 % at 25 ng/g) were obtained in oyster, crab, shrimp, and finfish matrices. The trueness of the method was demonstrated by quantifying VOCs at 1-2-ppb levels in oyster fortified with certified reference material NIST SRM 1491a. Following single laboratory validation, the method was employed for the determination of VOCs in seafood exposed to oil contaminated seawater and for the determination of background VOC levels in seafood species from the Gulf of Mexico and local food stores. The method as described can be used to supplement human sensory testing for petrochemical taint in seafood.",0
"Domesticated and growth hormone (GH) transgenic salmon provide an interesting model to compare effects of selected versus engineered phenotypic change on relative fitness in an ecological context. Phenotype in domestication is altered via polygenic selection of traits over multiple generations, whereas in transgenesis is altered by a single locus in one generation. These established and emerging technologies both result in elevated growth rates in culture, and are associated with similar secondary effects such as increased foraging, decreased predator avoidance, and similar endocrine and gene expression profiles. As such, there is concern regarding ecological consequences should fish that have been genetically altered escape to natural ecosystems. To determine if the type of genetic change influences fitness components associated with ecological success outside of the culture environments they were produced for, we examined growth and survival of domesticated, transgenic, and wild-type coho salmon fry under different environmental conditions. In simple conditions (i.e. culture) with unlimited food, transgenic fish had the greatest growth, while in naturalized stream tanks (limited natural food, with or without predators) domesticated fish had greatest growth and survival of the three fish groups. As such, the largest growth in culture conditions may not translate to the greatest ecological effects in natural conditions, and shifts in phenotype over multiple rather than one loci may result in greater success in a wider range of conditions. These differences may arise from very different historical opportunities of transgenic and domesticated strains to select for multiple growth pathways or counter-select against negative secondary changes arising from elevated capacity for growth, with domesticated fish potentially obtaining or retaining adaptive responses to multiple environmental conditions not yet acquired in recently generated transgenic strains.",0
"Introduction. Microbiological investigations of smoked salmon have traditionally focused on Listeria monocytogenes; however, few have examined total microbial spoilage communities over time. This is particularly true of hot smoked salmon, as curing reduces survival of heat-labile microorganisms. Purpose. The objective of this study was to examine the microbiome of hot smoked salmon over a 5-week refrigerated shelf life using traditional microbiological and next-generation sequencing methodologies. Methods. Hot smoked salmon fillets were stored aerobically at 4√ÅC for 35days with duplicate sampling on days 0, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 27, and 35. Traditional culture-based methods were used to determine aerobic plate count and lactic acid bacteria count, and representative isolates were chosen for genotyping by RS-RAPD. Microbial diversity was characterized by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequencing data were analyzed using QIIME 1.8. Results. Microbiome analysis depicted a complex initial diversity that decreased from day 7 through 17 but rebounded at day 21. Photobacterium, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were initially predominant, followed by a transition towards a population dominated by Moraxcellaceae. Spoilage populations beyond 3 weeks include Staphylococcus and Micrococcaceae. Brochothrix were observed as major constituents throughout, except during an intermediate spoilage period. Total mesophilic APC reached 2.8 x 107 CFU/g after 5 weeks, from which isolates clustered into 8 major clades by genotyping. Total LABs steadily increased to 2.0 x 106 CFU/g and yeasts to 3.2 x 105 CFU/g over the same period. Enterococcal populations remained near detection limits until day 21, after which sporadic growth to 1.0 x 105 CFU/g was observed. Genotyping of 198 isolates revealed temporal relationships complementary to deep sequencing data. Significance. Traditional microbiological culture and next-generation sequencing yielded complementary data that deepen understanding of microbial population dynamics during refrigerated storage of smoked salmon, and may enable targeted and more effective methods to increase shelf life.",0
"Edible shellfish Mytilus galloprovincialis and Crassostrea gigas have been investigated for the paralytic shellfish poisons using mouse bioassay and high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Paralytic shellfish poisons toxins were detected in mussels and oysters from September 2007 to May 2008. The level of paralytic shellfish poisons toxins in mussels reached the maximum in November with 832.9 mug saxitoxin-eq/100 g tissue. In oysters, toxins were detected with a maximum of 11.2 mug saxitoxin-eq/100 g tissue. The toxin high performance liquid chromatography profiles in mussels and oysters revealed the dominance of gonyautoxin 5 and N-sulfocarbamoyl-gonyautoxin-2 and -3 (C1-2), whereas GTX1-4, saxitoxin, and neosaxitoxin were found at low amounts. Overall, levels of paralytic shellfish poisons toxins were 20-70 times greater in mussels than in oysters. This is the first report on the qualitative and quantitative paralytic shellfish poisons content of M. galloprovincialis and C. gigas from a shellfish farming lagoon in Tunisia. ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",1

"Glyphosate-based herbicides are extensively used and can be measured in aquatic ecosystems, including coastal waters. The effect of glyphosate on non-target organisms is an issue of worldwide concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of subchronic exposure to glyphosate in juvenile oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Yearling oysters were exposed to three concentrations of glyphosate (0.1, 1 and 100mugL(-1)) for 56days. Various endpoints were studied, from the individual level (e.g., gametogenesis and tissue alterations) to the molecular level (mRNA quantification), including biochemical endpoints such as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase activities and malondialdehyde content. No mortality and growth occurred during the experiment, and individual biomarkers revealed only slight effects. The levels of gene expression significantly increased in oysters exposed to the highest glyphosate concentration (GST and metallothioneins) or to all concentrations (multi-xenobiotic resistance). These results suggested an activation of defence mechanisms at the molecular level.",1
"Suboptimal egg incubation temperature is a risk factor for the development of skeletal deformities in teleosts. Triplicate diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., egg batches were incubated at 6, 8 and 10 degrees C up until first feeding, whereupon fish were reared on a natural temperature before examination for externally visible skeletal deformities (jaw and spine) and radiographed for vertebral deformities and morphology at the parr stage. Increasing incubation temperatures and triploidy increased the number of fish showing one or more deformed vertebrae. Triploids had significantly higher mean vertebrae cranio-caudal length (L) and dorsal-ventral height (H) ratio at 6 and 10 degrees C than diploids, but triploidy had no effect on mean vertebrae centra area. Triploids demonstrated an increase in lower jaw deformities with increased incubation temperature, whereas jaw deformities were rare in diploids. Fish incubated at 10 degrees C had a significantly lower mean vertebral number than fish incubated at 6 degrees C, and triploids had lower mean vertebral numbers than diploids. Diploid fish with 58 vertebrae had a significantly higher mean vertebral centra area than fish with 59 vertebrae, but vertebral number did not affect the mean vertebral L/H ratio. The results are discussed with respect to the welfare and production of farmed salmonids.",1
"Glazing is a technique used to retard fish deterioration during storage. This work focuses on the study of distinct variables (fish temperature, coating temperature, dipping time) that affect the thickness of edible coatings (water glazing and 1.5% chitosan) applied on frozen fish. Samples of frozen Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) at -15, -20, and -25 √ÅC were either glazed with water at 0.5, 1.5 or 2.5 √ÅC or coated with 1.5% chitosan solution at 2.5, 5 or 8 √ÅC, by dipping during 10-60 s. For both water and chitosan coatings, lowering the salmon and coating solution temperatures resulted in an increase of coating thickness. At the same conditions, higher thickness values were obtained when using chitosan (max. thickness of 1.41 0.05 mm) compared to water (max. thickness of 0.84 0.03 mm). Freezing temperature and crystallization heat were found to be lower for 1.5% chitosan solution than for water, thus favoring phase change. Salmon temperature profiles allowed determining, for different dipping conditions, whether the salmon temperature was within food safety standards to prevent the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. The concept of safe dipping time is proposed to define how long a frozen product can be dipped into a solution without the temperature raising to a point where it can constitute a hazard.

"The transcription factor Fos is a member of one of the best-studied AP-1 sub-families and has been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes, including the regulation of apoptosis, immune responses and cytokine production. In this report, a novel mollusk Fos (referred to as ChFos) gene was cloned and characterized from the Hong Kong oyster, Crassostrea hongkongensis. The deduced ChFos protein sequence comprised 333 amino acids and shared significant homology with invertebrate homologs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ChFos clusters with Fos from Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea ariakensis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that ChFos mRNA was broadly expressed in all tested tissues and during different stages of the oyster's embryonic and larval development. In addition, the expression of ChFos mRNA was significantly up-regulated under challenge with microorganisms (Vibrio alginolyticus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs: LPS, PGN and polyI:C). Moreover, fluorescence microscopy showed that ChFos protein is localized in the nucleus in HEK293T cells. Reporter assays suggested that ChFos may act as an efficient transcription activator in the regulation of AP-1-responsive gene expression through interaction with ChJun. Overall, this study presents the first experimental evidence of the presence and functional characteristics of Fos in mollusks, which reveals its involvement in host protection against immune challenge in the oyster.",0
"Arsenic (As) exists as the toxic inorganic forms in marine water and sediment, while marine oysters usually accumulate high As contents mostly as the less toxic organic forms. It has not yet been clear that how As is biotransformed in marine oysters. This study therefore investigated the biotransformation and detoxification of two inorganic As forms (As(III) and As(V)) in Bombay oyster Saccostrea cucullata after waterborne exposures for 30 days. Seven treatments of dissolved As exposure (clean seawater, 1, 5, 20 mg/L As(III), and 1, 5, 20 mg/L As(V)) were performed. Body As concentration increased significantly after all As exposure treatments except 1mg/L As(V). Total As, As(III), and As(V) concentration were positive correlated with glutathione-S-transferases (GST) activities, suggesting GST might play an important role in the As biotransformation and detoxification process. Organic As species were predominant in control and the low As exposed oysters, whereas a large fraction of As was remained as the inorganic forms in the high As exposed oysters, suggesting As could be biotransformed efficiently in the oysters in clean or light contaminated environment. The results of As speciation demonstrated the As biotransformation in the oysters included As(V) reduction, methylation to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and subsequent conversion to arsenobetaine (AsB). More As was distributed in the subcellular metallothionein-like proteins fraction (MTLP) functioning sequestration and detoxification in the inorganic As exposed oysters, suggesting it was also a strategy for oysters against As stress. In summary, this study elucidated that marine oysters had high ability to accumulate, biotransform, and detoxify inorganic As.",0
"Waste oyster shells cause great environmental concerns and nickel is a harmful heavy metal. Therefore, we applied the Taguchi method to take care of both issues by optimizing the controllable factors for Ni(II) removal by calcined oyster shell powders (OSP), including the pH (P), OSP calcined temperature (T), Ni(II) concentration (C), OSP dose (D), and contact time (t). The results show that their percentage contribution in descending order is P (64.3%) > T (18.9%) > C (8.8%) > D (5.1%) > t (1.7%). The optimum condition is pH of 10 and OSP calcined temperature of 900 degrees C. Under the optimum condition, the Ni(II) can be removed almost completely; the higher the pH, the more the precipitation; the higher the calcined temperature, the more the adsorption. The latter is due to the large number of porosities created at the calcination temperature of 900 degrees C. The porosities generate a large amount of cavities which significantly increase the surface area for adsorption. A multiple linear regression equation obtained to correlate Ni(II) removal with the controllable factors is: Ni(II) removal(%) = 10.35 x P + 0.045 x T - 1.29 x C + 19.33 x D + 0.09 x t - 59.83. This equation predicts Ni(II) removal well and can be used for estimating Ni(II) removal during the design stage of Ni(II) removal by calcined OSP. Thus, OSP can be used to remove nickel effectively and the formula for removal prediction is developed for practical applications.",0
"Vibrio vulnificus (Vv) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) are opportunistic human pathogens naturally associated with the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. The abundances of both pathogens in oysters are positively correlated with temperature, thus ingestion of raw oysters during the warm summer months is a risk factor for contracting illness from these bacteria. Current post-harvest processing (PHP) methods for elimination of these pathogens are expensive and kill the oyster, changing their organoleptic properties and making them less appealing to some consumers. High salinity has proven effective in reducing Vv numbers in the wild and our research aims at developing an indoor recirculating system to reduce pathogenic Vibrios while maintaining the taste and texture of live oysters. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of temperature on the efficacy of high salinity depuration. Vv was enumerated as most probable number (MPN) per gram of oyster tissue using the FDA-approved modified cellobiose polymyxin colistin (mCPC) protocol and with an alternative Vibrio specific media CHROMagar Vibrio (CaV). CaV was also used to quantify Vp. Oysters were held at 35 psu for 10 days at three temperatures: low (20 degrees C), mid (22.5 degrees C) and high (25 degrees C). There was no difference in MPN/g of Vv between media; however more Vv isolates were obtained from mCPC than CaV. There was no significant effect of temperature on reduction of Vv or Vp throughout depuration but there was a tendency for low temperatures to be less effective than the higher ones. High salinity resulted in a significant decrease in Vv by day 3 and again by day 10, and a decrease in Vp by day 3. Oyster condition indices were maintained throughout depuration and mortality was low (4% across three trials). Overall these results support the use of mCPC for Vv enumeration and demonstrate the promise of high salinity depuration for PHP of the Eastern oyster. The trend for lower temperatures to be less effective is surprising and indicates a potential interaction between salinity and temperature that should be further investigated.",0
"The host-pathogen interactions between the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV-1) are poorly characterised. Herpesviruses are a group of large, DNA viruses that are known to encode gene products that subvert their host's antiviral response. It is likely that OsHV-1 has also evolved similar strategies as its genome encodes genes with high homology to C. gigas inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and an interferon-stimulated gene (termed CH25H). The first objective of this study was to simultaneously investigate the expression of C. gigas and OsHV-1 genes that share high sequence homology during an acute infection. Comparison of apoptosis-related genes revealed that components of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (TNF) were induced in response to OsHV-1 infection, but we failed to observe evidence of apoptosis using a combination of biochemical and molecular assays. IAPs encoded by OsHV-1 were highly expressed during the acute stage of infection and may explain why we didn't observe evidence of apoptosis. However, C. gigas must have an alternative mechanism to apoptosis for clearing OsHV-1 from infected gill cells as we observed a reduction in viral DNA between 27 and 54 h post-infection. The reduction of viral DNA in C. gigas gill cells occurred after the up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (viperin, PKR, ADAR). In a second objective, we manipulated the host's anti-viral response by injecting C. gigas with a small dose of poly I:C at the time of OsHV-1 infection. This small dose of poly I:C was unable to induce transcription of known antiviral effectors (ISGs), but these oysters were still capable of inhibiting OsHV-1 replication. This result suggests dsRNA induces an anti-viral response that is additional to the IFN-like pathway.",0
"Because of the continued development and production of a variety of nanomaterials and nanoparticles, their uptake and effects on the biota of marine ecosystems must be investigated. Filter feeding bivalve molluscs are highly adapted for capturing particles from the external environment and readily internalize nano- and micro-sized particles through endocytosis, so they are commonly used as valuable indicator species for nanoparticle studies. In these studies, adult eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica, were exposed to a range of titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO2-NP) concentrations (5, 50, 500, and 5000 mug/L) in conjunction with natural sunlight. Isolated hepatopancreas tissues were also exposed to the same TiO2-NP concentrations using particles exposed to similar light and dark conditions. Dose-dependent decreases in lysosomal stability were observed in the adult oyster studies as well as in the isolated tissues, at exposures as low as 50 mug/L. Titanium accumulation in isolated hepatopancreas tissue studies was directly correlated to lysosomal destabilization. Based on measurements of lipid peroxidation as an indicator of oxidative stress, TiO2-NPs toxicity was not related to increased ROS production over the short-term course of these exposures. Analysis of particle size using dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that concentration had a significant impact on agglomeration rates, and the small agglomerates as well as individual particles are readily processed by oysters. Overall, this study illustrates that low concentrations of TiO2-NPs may cause sublethal toxicity on oysters, which might be enhanced under natural sunlight conditions. In estuarine environments, where these nanomaterials are likely to accumulate, agglomeration rates, interaction with organics, and responses to sunlight are critical in determining the extent of their bioreactivity and biological impacts.",1
"Reconstructive surgery for tumor resection, trauma, and congenital anomaly involves volume augmentation with autologous tissue transfer. However, a healthy region is damaged as a donor site, and the autologous tissue is transferred like a patchwork to the recipient site. We have attempted to induce adipogenesis activity in artificial biomaterial that is injectable with an injection needle for soft tissue augmentation. First of all, the optimal dose of pioglitazone hydrochloride was examined with adipo-precursor cells in terms of the proliferator-activated receptor-gamma mRNA expression levels affected by reagent in vitro. Then, salmon collagen with pioglitazone was adjusted in terms of the dose and the salmon collagen was injected into mouse back using an injection needle in vivo. At 4 weeks after implantation, the pioglitazone collagen gel was substituted by mature adipocytes in comparison with the case for control collagen gel without pioglitazone. These results are indicative of the possibility of promoting adipogenesis using collagen with pioglitazone as an adipose-inductive substance.",0
"Salmon and herring from the Baltic Sea are prohibited for sale for human consumption in the European Union or only allowed to be marketed under certain conditions. Fish from certain specific geographical origins also command higher prices in the market than fish from elsewhere. It is, therefore, important to be able to enforce correct labeling of geographical origin through authentication. One authentication strategy is to examine trace markers specific for a geographical origin. The chemical contaminants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) were released inhomogeneously into the environment for many years and may therefore be suitable as markers. This study comprises PCBs and PCDD/Fs analyses of 79 samples of salmon originating from Canada, Chile, China, Norway, USA, Vietnam, and the Baltic Sea near Denmark, all sampled from 2002 through 2015. Principal component analyses (PCA) were built from the combined PCB and PCDD/F profile as well as separately from the individual PCB and PCDD/F profiles. Use of the PCB profile for the PCA provided stronger power to distinguish between salmon of different geographical origin than using the PCDD/F profile or the combined profiles.

"BACKGROUND: Microbial diseases cause considerable economic losses in aquaculture and new infection control measures often rely on a better understanding of pathogenicity. However, disease studies performed in fish hosts often require specialist infrastructure (e.g., aquaria), adherence to strict legislation and do not permit high-throughput approaches; these reasons justify the development of alternative hosts. This study aimed to validate the use of larvae of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella) to investigate virulence of the important fish pathogen, Vibrio anguillarum. RESULTS: Using 11 wild-type isolates of V. anguillarum, these bacteria killed larvae in a dose-dependent manner and replicated inside the haemolymph, but infected larvae were rescued by antibiotic therapy. Crucially, virulence correlated significantly and positively in larva and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) infection models. Challenge studies with mutants knocked out for single virulence determinants confirmed conserved roles in larva and fish infections in some cases (pJM1 plasmid, rtxA), but not all (empA, flaA, flaE). CONCLUSIONS: The G. mellonella model is simple, more ethically acceptable than experiments on vertebrates and, crucially, does not necessitate liquid systems, which reduces infrastructure requirements and biohazard risks associated with contaminated water. The G. mellonella model may aid our understanding of microbial pathogens in aquaculture and lead to the timely introduction of new effective remedies for infectious diseases, while adhering to the principles of replacement, reduction and refinement (3Rs) and considerably reducing the number of vertebrates used in such studies.",0
"Apoptosis is a fundamental feature in the development of many organisms and tissue systems. It is also a mechanism of host defense against environmental stress factors or pathogens by contributing to the elimination of infected cells. Hemocytes play a key role in defense mechanisms in invertebrates and previous studies have shown that physical or chemical stress can increase apoptosis in hemocytes in mollusks. However this phenomenon has rarely been investigated in bivalves especially in the flat oyster Ostrea edulis. The apoptotic response of hemocytes from flat oysters, O. edulis, was investigated after exposure to UV and dexamethasone, two agents known to induce apoptosis in vertebrates. Flow cytometry and microscopy were combined to demonstrate that apoptosis occurs in flat oyster hemocytes. Investigated parameters like intracytoplasmic calcium activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and phosphatidyl-serine externalization were significantly modulated in cells exposed to UV whereas dexamethasone only induced an increase of DNA fragmentation. Morphological changes were also observed on UV-treated cells using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Our results confirm the apoptotic effect of UV on hemocytes of O. edulis and suggest that apoptosis is an important mechanism developed by the flat oyster against stress factors.",0
"Pacific salmon exposed to sublethal concentrations of organophosphate pesticides (OP) have impaired olfactory function that can lead to loss of behaviors that are essential for survival. These exposures often involve mixtures and can occur at levels below those which inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE). In this study, juvenile Coho salmon were exposed for 24 h to either 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 ppb chlorpyrifos (CPF), 2, 10, or 50 ppb malathion (MAL), or binary mixtures of 0.1 CPF:2 ppb MAL, 0.5 CPF:10 ppb MAL, or 2.5 CPF:10 ppb MAL to mimic single and binary environmental exposures. Microarray analysis of olfactory rosettes from pesticide-exposed salmon revealed differentially expressed genes involved in nervous system function and signaling, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, xenobiotic metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Coho exposed to OP mixtures exhibited a more pronounced loss in detection of a predatory olfactory cue relative to those exposed to single compounds, whereas respirometry experiments demonstrated that exposure to OPs, individually and in mixtures, reduced maximum respiratory capacity of olfactory rosette mitochondria. The observed molecular, biochemical, and behavioral effects occurred largely in the absence of effects on brain AChE. In summary, our results provide new insights associated with the sublethal neurotoxic effects of OP mixtures relevant to environmental exposures involving molecular and cellular pathways of injury to the salmon olfactory system that underlie neurobehavioral injury.",1
"Atlantic salmon is susceptible to the salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) and the variation in susceptibility within the species can be exploited in selective breeding programs for louse resistant fish. In this study, lice counts were completed on 3000 siblings from 150 families of Atlantic salmon identified as high resistant (HR) and low resistant (LR) families in two independent challenge trials. Skin samples behind the dorsal fin (nearby lice attachment) were collected from ten extreme families (HR or LR) and analyzed by qPCR for the expression of 32 selected genes, including a number of genes involved in T helper cell (Th) mediated immune responses, which have been previously implied to play important roles during salmon louse infections. Most genes showed lower expression patterns in the LR than in HR fish, suggesting an immunosuppressed state in LR families. The average number of lice (chalimi) was 9 in HR and 15 in LR fish. Large variation in lice counts was seen both within resistant and susceptible families, which enabled us to subdivide the groups into HR < 10 and HR > 10, and LR < 10 and LR > 10 to better understand the effect of lice burden per se. As expected, expression patterns were influenced both by genetic background and the number of attached parasites. Higher number of lice (>10) negatively affected gene expression in both HR and LR families. In general, strongest down-regulation was seen in LR > 10 and lesser down-regulation in HR < 10. HR in general and especially HR < 10 fish were better at resisting suppression of expression of both Th1 and Th2 genes. However, the best inverse correlation with infection level was seen for the prototypical Th1 genes, including several members from the interferon pathways. In addition, skin histomorphometry suggests that infected LR salmon had thicker epidermis in the area behind the dorsal fin and larger mucous cell size compared to infected HR fish, however marginally significant (p = 0.08). This histomorphometric finding was in line with the immune response being skewed in LR towards the Th2 rather than a Th1 profile. Our findings suggest that the ability to resist lice infection depends on the ability to avoid immunosuppression and not as much on the physical tissue barrier functions.",0
"Ocean acidification processes are major threats to marine calcifying organisms, mostly affecting biomineralization related processes. Abiotic stressors acting on marine systems do not act alone, rather in a combination of multiple stressors, especially in coastal habitats such as estuaries, where anthropogenic and environmental pressures are high. Arsenic (As) is a widely distributed contaminant worldwide and its toxicity has been studied on a variety of organisms. However, the effect of low pH on the toxicity of As on marine organisms is unknown. Here, we studied the combined effects of ocean acidification and As exposure on two closely related oyster species (Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas), by use of a biochemical approach. Oxidative stress related parameters were studied along with the assessment of biomineralization enzymes activity after 28days of exposure. Results showed that both species were sensitive to all tested conditions (low pH, As and pH+As), showing enhancement of antioxidant and biotransformation defenses and impairment of biomineralization processes. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) activity were significantly higher in oysters exposed to As, showing activation of detoxification mechanisms, and a lower GSTs activity was observed in low pH+As condition, indicating an impact on the oysters capacity to detoxify As in a low pH scenario. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity was significantly lower in all tested conditions, showing to be affected by both As and low pH, whereas the combined effect of low pH+As was not different from the effect of low pH alone. Multivariate analysis of biochemical data allowed for the comparison of both species performance, showing a clear distinction of response in both species. C. gigas presented overall higher enzymatic activity (GSTs; superoxide dismutase; catalase; CA and acid phosphatase) and higher cytosolic GSH content in As exposed oysters than C. angulata. Results obtained indicate a higher tolerance capacity of the Pacific oyster C. gigas towards the tested conditions.",0
"Outbreaks of norovirus (NoV) gastroenteritis are often associated with consumption of shellfish contaminated with human NoVs. Strong non-specific binding and specific binding between NoVs and histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) present in shellfish tissues may explain why depuration is ineffective. Recent studies on NoV-binding patterns in shellfish have examined the attachment of NoV virus-like particles (VLPs) to HBGAs present in shellfish using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). As NoVs are genetically diverse, it is not practical to produce a range of VLPs and specific antibodies for binding studies. Tank-based bioaccumulation experiments for binding studies also require laboratory space and time. The aim of this study was to develop an alternative method to determine binding patterns for a range of shellfish species and NoV genotypes without using VLPs, antibodies, or tanks. Pacific oysters, green-lipped mussels, two GI and four GII NoV genotypes were selected for assay development. Shellfish gut homogenates were coated onto microwell plates, then purified NoV suspensions were added to each well. Blocking and wash steps using similar reagents as used in ELISAs were carried out. RNA was extracted directly in each well, then RNA copies were quantified by RT-qPCR. Diluent buffer-coated wells spiked with NoVs were used as controls. Different binding patterns were observed. NoV binding was always higher with oysters than with mussels. The highest NoV binding was found with GI.3 and oysters, with 97 % NoV GI.3 bound to oyster homogenate compared with 5 % bound to mussel homogenate. GI.4 did not bind to mussels.",0
"Concentrations of isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-, beta-, gamma-HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were assessed in organs of the pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), chum (Oncorhynchus keta), chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), caught near the Kuril Islands (the northern-western part of the Pacific Ocean), in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea. Pesticides have been found to accumulate in fish organs in the following: muscles < liver < eggs < male gonads. The highest concentrations in muscles and liver have been recorded from sockeye. Of the DDT group, only DDE has been detected. The average concentration of HCHs + DDE in the muscles of pink, chum, chinook, and sockeye was 141, 125, 1241, 1641 ng/g lipids, respectively; and in the liver, 279, 183, 1305, 3805 ng/g lipids, respectively. The total concentration of HCHs isomers was higher than that of DDE. Average HCHs + DDE concentration in organs of salmon from study area is lower than that in salmon from Pacific coast of North America.",0
"In the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, sea lice outbreaks in caged salmon are treated with pesticides including Salmosan((R)), applied as bath treatments and then released into the surrounding seawater. The effect of chronic exposure to low concentrations of this pesticide on neighboring lobster populations is a concern. Adult male lobsters were exposed to 61 ngL(-1) of azamethiphos (a.i. in Salmosan((R)) formulation) continuously for 10 days. In addition to the direct effects of pesticide exposure, effects on the ability to cope with shipping conditions and the persistence of the effects after a 24h depuration period in clean seawater were assessed. Indicators of stress and hypoxia (serum total proteins, hemocyanin and lactate), oxidative damage (protein carbonyls in gills and serum) and altered energy allocation (hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices, hepatopancreas lipids) were assessed in addition to neurotoxicity (chlolinesterase activity in muscle). Directly after exposure, azamethiphos-treated lobsters had inhibition of muscle cholinesterase, reduced gonadosomatic index and enhanced hepatosomatic index and hepatopancreas lipid content. All these responses persisted after 24-h depuration, increasing the risk of cumulative impacts with further exposure to chemical or non-chemical stressors. In both control and treated lobsters exposed to simulated shipment conditions, concentrations of protein and lactate in serum, and protein carbonyls in gills increased. However, mortality rate was higher in azamethiphos-treated lobsters (33 +/- 14%) than in controls (2.6 +/- 4%). Shipment and azamethiphos had cumulative impacts on serum proteins. Both direct effects on neurological function and energy allocation and indirect effect on ability to cope with shipping stress could have significant impacts on lobster population and/or fisheries.",1
"Flavobacterial diseases, caused by multiple members of the Family Flavobacteriaceae, elicit serious losses in wild and farmed fish around the world. Flavobacteria are known to be transmitted horizontally; however, vertical transmission has been suspected but proven only for one fish-pathogenic flavobacterial species (e.g., Flavobacterium psychrophilum). Herein, we report on the isolation and molecular identification of multiple Flavobacterium and Chryseobacterium taxa from the ovarian fluid and eggs of feral Great Lakes Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Identified egg- and ovarian fluid-associated flavobacteria were either well-known flavobacterial fish pathogens (e.g., F. psychrophilum and F. columnare), most similar to emerging fish-associated flavobacteria (e.g., F. spartansii, F. tructae, F. piscis, C. piscium, C. scophthalmum), or were distinct from all other described Chryseobacterium and Flavobacterium spp., as determined by phylogenetic analyses using neighbor-joining, Bayesian, and Maximum Likelihood methodologies. The gamete-associated flavobacteria fell into three groups (e.g., those that were recovered from the ovarian fluid but not eggs; those that were recovered from the ovarian fluid and eggs; and those that were recovered from eggs but not ovarian fluid), a portion of which were recovered from eggs that were surface disinfected with iodophor at the commonly used dose and duration for egg disinfection. Some gamete-associated flavobacteria were also found in renal, splenic, and neurological tissues. Systemic polymicrobial infections comprised of F. psychrophilum and F. columnare were also detected at nearly an 11% prevalence. This study highlights the potential role that sexual products of female Great Lakes Chinook salmon may play in the transmission of fish-associated flavobacteria.",1
"Few studies have been published on the excretion rates of parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hydroxy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAHs) following oral exposure. This study investigated the metabolism and excretion rates of 4 parent PAHs and 10 OH-PAHs after the consumption of smoked salmon. Nine members of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation consumed 50 g of traditionally smoked salmon with breakfast and five urine samples were collected during the following 24 h. The concentrations of OH-PAHs increased from 43.9 mug/g creatinine for 2-OH-Nap to 349 ng/g creatinine for 1-OH-Pyr, 3 to 6 h post-consumption. Despite volunteers following a restricted diet, there appeared to be a secondary source of naphthalene and fluorene, which led to excretion efficiencies greater than 100%. For the parent PAHs that were detected in urine, the excretion efficiencies ranged from 13% for phenanthrene (and its metabolite) to 240% for naphthalene (and its metabolites). The half-lives for PAHs ranged from 1.4 h for retene to 3.3h for pyrene. The half-lives for OH-PAHs were higher and ranged from 1.7 h for 9-OH-fluorene to 7.0 h for 3-OH-fluorene. The concentrations of most parent PAHs, and their metabolites, returned to the background levels 24 h post-consumption.",0
"The bivalve mollusc, Crassostrea virginica, is frequently exposed to blooms of Karenia brevis along the west coast of Florida during periods of spawning and early larval development. A continuous 4-day exposure of gametes and 2-4 cell stage embryos of C. virginica to whole-cell and culture filtrate of K. brevis at 500 and 5000 cells mL(-1), was followed by a 4-day 'recovery' period. Larval growth, percent of normal, abnormal and dead larvae, and the presence of food in the larval gut were measured throughout the exposure period. Results suggest that negative effects mainly occur during embryogenesis and early development. Damage to feeding apparatus/gut may occur during embryonic development or exposure to toxins may act as a feeding deterrent on non-toxic algae. Following 2-h in vitro exposure of gametes, differences in oocyte and sperm cell parameters were investigated using flow cytometry. The reduced sperm viability in the whole-cell 5000 cells mL(-1) treatment suggests the involvement of extracellular brevetoxins (PbTx) and perhaps other harmful, uncharacterized compounds associated with the K. brevis cell membrane. The cumulative effects of reduced sperm viability, fertilization success, embryonic and larval survival, and the near-annual exposure to blooms of K. brevis could cause significant bottlenecks on oyster recruitment.",0
"A novel herpesvirus was found by molecular methods in samples of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush from Lake Erie, Pennsylvania, and Lake Ontario, Keuka Lake, and Lake Otsego, New York. Based on PCR amplification and partial sequencing of polymerase, terminase, and glycoprotein genes, a number of isolates were identified as a novel virus, which we have named Namaycush herpesvirus (NamHV) salmonid herpesvirus 5 (SalHV5). Phylogenetic analyses of three NamHV genes indicated strong clustering with other members of the genus Salmonivirus, placing these isolates into family Alloherpesviridae. The NamHV isolates were identical in the three partially sequenced genes; however, they varied from other salmonid herpesviruses in nucleotide sequence identity. In all three of the genes sequenced, NamHV shared the highest sequence identity with Atlantic Salmon papillomatosis virus (ASPV; SalHV4) isolated from Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar in northern Europe, including northwestern Russia. These results lead one to believe that NamHV and ASPV have a common ancestor that may have made a relatively recent host jump from Atlantic Salmon to Lake Trout or vice versa. Partial nucleotide sequence comparisons between NamHV and ASPV for the polymerase and glycoprotein genes differ by >5% and >10%, respectively. Additional nucleotide sequence comparisons between NamHV and epizootic epitheliotropic disease virus (EEDV/SalHV3) in the terminase, glycoprotein, and polymerase genes differ by >5%, >20%, and >10%, respectively. Thus, NamHV and EEDV may be occupying discrete ecological niches in Lake Trout. Even though NamHV shared the highest genetic identity with ASPV, each of these viruses has a separate host species, which also implies speciation. Additionally, NamHV has been detected over the last 4 years in four separate water bodies across two states, which suggests that NamHV is a distinct, naturally replicating lineage. This, in combination with a divergence in nucleotide sequence from EEDV, indicates that NamHV is a new species in the genus Salmonivirus. Received April 20, 2015; accepted October 11, 2015.",0
"The aim of the present study was to develop the first generation of a novel natural antimicrobial packaging system which could be activated by consumers at home. For this purpose, antimicrobial films having a pH-triggering mechanism which could be activated by acidification were developed by exploiting isoelectric properties and pH induced charge-charge interactions between whey proteins (WP) and lysozyme (LYS). The release tests of films in buffers and on coated smoked salmon slices at 4 √ÅC showed the immobilization of positively charged LYS by the negatively charged WP films at pHs _ 5.5. The LYS release initiated when pH was reduced below 5.5 where WP started to gain positive charges. The amount of LYS released and LYS release rate increased as pH reduced gradually from 5.5 to 3.0. The preparation of composite films of WP with beeswax (BW) and oleic acid (OLE) increased the total released LYS from films. WP, WP-OLE and WP-BW films showed antimicrobial activity against Listeria innocua in laboratory media. The smoked salmon slices coated by activated LYS containing WP-OLE films showed significantly lower (almost 0.6 decimal) L. innocua counts than controls after 1 week at 4 √ÅC. This study clearly showed that the antimicrobial films could be activated by consumers to improve safety of opened packed food stored in home type refrigerators. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Concentrations of the macroelements Ca, Mg, K and Na, microelements Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn and toxic metals As, Cd, Hg and Pb were determined in oysters and mussels collected at farming sites in the northern, central and south Adriatic Sea. Mean concentrations in oysters were (mg kg-1): As 4.51, Ca 1551, Cd 1.44, Cu 53.6, Cr 0.23, Fe 45.9, Hg 0.047, K 2476, Mg 895, Mn 2.80, Na 7148, Pb 0.52, Zn 675. Mean values in mussels were (mg kg-1): As 4.71, Ca 601, Cd 0.37, Cu 1.91, Cr 0.29, Fe 49.6, Hg 0.026, K 2246, Mg 1043, Mn 2.49, Na 7992, Pb 0.58, Zn 28.8. Significant differences in the concentrations of toxic metals and elements were found in oysters and mussels among farming sites. Obtained Cd, Hg and Pb concentration in oysters and mussels were lower than the limit levels set by the European Community. However, Cd concentration exceeded the limit level of 1 mg kg-1 in oysters from all locations except Lim Bay. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) indicate that oysters are a good source of Ca, Cu and Zn. The higher Cu and Zn concentrations than the toxicity reference values suggest a risk for consumers if larger quantities of oysters are consumed frequently. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",1
"We reported previously that okadaic acid (OA) and dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX1) were responsible for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) incidents due to consuming cultivated mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in coastal cities near the East China Sea in May 2011. Pectenotoxin-2 (PTX2) and its seco acids were also present in these mussels. Causative species of microalgae were not identified because detailed information on the location of the contaminated shellfish was not recorded. In order to explore potential causes for these poisoning events, the lipophilic toxin profiles in picked cells of Dinophysis and in shellfish samples collected from two mariculture zones in the East China Sea were analyzed in the present study. Single-cell isolates (100 cells total for each location) of Dinophysis were collected from the aquaculture zones of Gouqi Island (Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province) and Qingchuan Bay (Ningde City, Fujian Province) in July and September 2013, respectively, for lipophilic toxin profiling. Shellfish samples collected over the course of a year from the Gouqi Island aquaculture zone and mussels (M. galloprovincialis) collected four times from the Qingchuan Bay aquaculture zone were tested for lipophilic toxins by LC-MS/MS. The Dinophysis cells isolated from both sampling sites were identified under the light microscope as Dinophysis caudata. Average quota of PTX2, the predominant toxin in D. caudata isolated from the coastal waters of Gouqi Island and Qingchuan Bay, was 0.58 and 2.8 pg/cell, respectively. Only trace amounts of OA and DTX1 were detected in D. caudata. PTX2, PTX2sa, 7-epi-PTX2sa, OA, and/or DTX1 were found in samples of mussels (M. galloprovincialis and Mytilus coruscus) collected in the Gouqi Island aquaculture zone from the end of May to the beginning of July 2013. PTX2, PTX2sa, and 7-epi-PTX2sa were also detected in oyster (Crassostrea gigas) during that period, but almost no OA and DTX1 were present. Gymnodimine (GYM) was detected in almost all mussel (M. coruscus) samples, with the highest levels occurring in winter. Trace amounts of pectenotoxins (PTXs) and OAs were also found in mussels (M. galloprovincialis) collected from Qingchuan Bay. D. caudata is suggested as an important source of PTXs in shellfish cultivated in the East China Sea. This is the first report of toxin profiles for single-cell isolates of Dinophysis in the East China Sea.",0
"The antioxidant activities of enzymatically hydrolyzed (protease from Bacillus cereus SU12) oyster (Saccostrea cucullata) protein were studied. The hydrolysate exhibited a strong antioxidant potential in 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH, 85.7 0.37%), followed by hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging activity (81.6 0.3%), hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (79.32 0.6%), and reducing power assay (2.63 0.2 OD at 700 nm) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. Due to the high antioxidant potential, the hydrolysate was purified in Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography. The active peptide fraction was identified by DPPH and reducing power assay. The amino acid content of the purified active peptide fraction was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. The active fraction contained a good quantity of both essential and nonessential amino acids. The present study revealed that oyster (S. cucullata) protein hydrolysate is a potential source for natural antioxidants. Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), used as commercial flame-retardants, are bioaccumulating in threatened Pacific salmon. However, little is known of PBDE effects on critical physiological functions required for optimal health and survival. BDE-47 and BDE-99 are the predominant PBDE congeners found in Chinook salmon collected from the Pacific Northwest. In the present study, both innate immunity (phagocytosis and production of superoxide anion) and pathogen challenge were used to evaluate health and survival in groups of juvenile Chinook salmon exposed orally to either BDE-47 or BDE-99 at environmentally relevant concentrations. Head kidney macrophages from Chinook salmon exposed to BDE-99, but not those exposed to BDE-47, were found to have a reduced ability in vitro to engulf foreign particles. However, both congeners increased the in vitro production of superoxide anion in head kidney macrophages. Salmon exposed to either congener had reduced survival during challenge with the pathogenic marine bacteria Listonella anguillarum. The concentration response curves generated for these end points were nonmonotonic and demonstrated a requirement for using multiple environmentally relevant PBDE concentrations for effect studies. Consequently, predicting risk from toxicity reference values traditionally generated with monotonic concentration responses may underestimate PBDE effect on critical physiological functions required for optimal health and survival in salmon.",0
"Soluble gas stabilisation (SGS) is a recently proposed method to extend the shelf life of food. However, no studies have determined the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed in food and particularly in oysters. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine CO2 absorption and desorption rates in oysters during the solubilisation process. Cooked oysters were placed in the apparatus's chamber, CO2 was injected into the chamber, and the SGS process started at different pressures, temperatures and gas/product (g/p) ratios. CO2 absorption and desorption rates were obtained from data of CO2 concentration in the chamber headspace and calculated by mathematical models. The results showed higher absorption rates under higher pressure, higher g/p ratio and lower temperature (0 √ÅC). The concentration of CO2 dissolved in the oysters was 21008.45 mg CO2 kg product-1. On the other hand, lower desorption rates occurred for the lowest pressure (200 kPa) and lowest gas/product ratio (1:1). For CO2 desorption from oysters, it was observed that 10 min was enough to desorb a large amount of CO2 under normal atmosphere. ¬© 2015 Institute of Food Science and Technology.",0
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a crucial foodborne pathogen. The viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state of V. parahaemolyticus cannot be detected by traditional culture methods. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a method that combines propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment with real-time fluorescent loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RF-LAMP) to detect and quantify VBNC cells of V. parahaemolyticus. Different states of cells were treated with PMA in dark for 5 min and subsequently exposed to a 650 W halogen lamp for 5 min. The cells were collected and DNA was amplified by RF-LAMP. The primers which targeted six distinct regions in the tlh gene of V. parahaemolyticus were used for the PMA-RF-LAMP assay. The results indicated that the treatment with 4 mug/mL of PMA and a further exposure to light for 5 min was suitable for PMA-RF-LAMP to distinguish viable cells from dead cells of V. parahaemolyticus. The developed assay exhibited remarkably high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity, without any cross reaction with the tested non-V. parahaemolyticus strains. There was good linear correlation between Ct values and log copy/mL in the range of 6.8-6.8 * 107 copy/mL, with the reaction endpoints less than 30 cycles (30 min). It could detect as low as 14 copy/g of V. parahaemolyticus in spiked seafood samples (pomfret, shrimp, scallop, oyster and salted fish) without any interference from food matrices, dead cells and other bacteria.

"The human-pathogenic marine bacteria Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are strongly correlated with water temperature, with concentrations increasing as waters warm seasonally. Both of these bacteria can be concentrated in filter-feeding shellfish, especially oysters. Because oysters are often consumed raw, this exposes people to large doses of potentially harmful bacteria. Various models are used to predict the abundance of these bacteria in oysters, which guide shellfish harvest policy meant to reduce human health risk. Vibrio abundance and behaviour varies from site to site, suggesting that location-specific studies are needed to establish targeted risk reduction strategies. Moreover, virulence potential, rather than simple abundance, should be also be included in future modeling efforts.",0
"We report here the draft genome sequence of a rickettsia-like organism, isolated from a New Zealand Chinook salmon farm experiencing high mortality. The genome is approximately 3 Mb in size, has a G+C content of approximately 39.2%, and is predicted to contain 2,870 coding sequences.",0
"Fish is a major source for the intake of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). However, fish is scarcely consumed without being cooked, and previous studies showed that the heating of salmon fillet contaminated with BDE-209 for longer periods of time was accompanied with the partial transformation of this brominated flame retardant. In this study, we heated salmon fillet spiked with BDE-209 and verified that this process was linked with the formation of polybrominated dibenzofurans (PBDFs) in the fish. Each minute of heating 1 g salmon fillet spiked with 200 ng BDE-209 generated about 0.5 per thousand PBDFs relative to the initial amount of the pre-dioxin BDE-209. This result of the chemical analysis by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was verified by means of an effect-directed bio-assay (DR CALUX). While unheated salmon with BDE-209 and heated salmon without BDE-209 were tested nontoxic, the bioanalytical response of fish linearly increased upon heating. We also found that PBDF formation did neither occur with BDE-47 nor when BDE-209 was heated in edible oil instead of salmon fillet. Due to the formation of PBDFs in this process, the consumption of heated, BDE-209 contaminated fish may add to the uptake of dioxin-like compounds with our diet.",1
"The food-borne pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus has been reported as being present in New Zealand (NZ) seawaters, but there have been no reported outbreaks of food-borne infection from commercially grown NZ seafood. Our study determined the current incidence of V. parahaemolyticus in NZ oysters and Greenshell mussels and the prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus tdh and trh strains. Pacific (235) and dredge (21) oyster samples and mussel samples (55) were obtained from commercial shellfish-growing areas between December 2009 and June 2012. Total V. parahaemolyticus numbers and the presence of pathogenic genes tdh and trh were determined using the FDA most-probable-number (MPN) method and confirmed using PCR analysis. In samples from the North Island of NZ, V. parahaemolyticus was detected in 81% of Pacific oysters and 34% of mussel samples, while the numbers of V. parahaemolyticus tdh and trh strains were low, with just 3/215 Pacific oyster samples carrying the tdh gene. V. parahaemolyticus organisms carrying tdh and trh were not detected in South Island samples, and V. parahaemolyticus was detected in just 1/21 dredge oyster and 2/16 mussel samples. Numbers of V. parahaemolyticus organisms increased when seawater temperatures were high, the season when most commercial shellfish-growing areas are not harvested. The numbers of V. parahaemolyticus organisms in samples exceeded 1,000 MPN/g only when the seawater temperatures exceeded 19 degrees C, so this environmental parameter could be used as a trigger warning of potential hazard. There is some evidence that the total V. parahaemolyticus numbers increased compared with those reported from a previous 1981 to 1984 study, but the analytical methods differed significantly.",0
"The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA provided opportunities for women to conduct research in the late 19th and early 20th century at a time when many barriers existed to their pursuit of a scientific career. One woman who benefited from the welcoming environment at the MBL was Mary Jane Hogue. Her remarkable career as an experimental biologist spanned over 55 years. Hogue was born into a Quaker family in 1883 and received her undergraduate degree from Goucher College. She went to Germany to obtain an advanced degree, and her research at the University of Wurzburg with Theodor Boveri resulted in her Ph.D. (1909). Although her research interests included experimental embryology, and the use of tissue culture to study a variety of cell types, she is considered foremost a protozoologist. Her extraordinary demonstration of chromidia (multiple fission) in the life history of a new species of Flabellula associated with diseased oyster beds is as important as it is ignored. We discuss Hogue's career path and her science to highlight the importance of an informal network of teachers, research advisors, and other women scientists at the MBL all of whom contributed to her success as a woman scientist.",0
"During the early 1950s, Sammy M. Ray discovered that his high-salt modification of fluid thioglycollate sterility test medium caused dramatic in vitro enlargement of Perkinsus marinus (=Dermocystidium marinum) cells that coincidentally infected several experimentally cultured oyster gill tissue explants. Subsequent testing confirmed that the enlarged cells among some oyster tissues incubated in Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM) were those of that newly described oyster pathogen. Non-proliferative in vitro enlargement, cell wall thickening, and subsequent blue-black iodine-staining of hypertrophied trophozoites (=hypnospores=prezoosporangia) following incubation in RFTM are unique characteristics of confirmed members of the protistan genus Perkinsus. A number of in vitro assays and manipulations with RFTM have been developed for selective detection and enumeration of Perkinsus sp. cells in tissues of infected molluscs, and in environmental samples. RFTM-enlarged Perkinsus sp. cells from tissues of infected molluscs also serve as useful inocula for initiating in vitro isolate cultures, and cells of several Perkinsus spp. from both in vitro cultures and infected mollusc tissues may be induced to zoosporulate by brief incubations in RFTM. DNAs from RFTM-enlarged Perkinsus sp. cells provide useful templates for PCR amplifications, and for sequencing and other assays to differentiate and identify the detected Perkinsus species. We review the history and components of fluid thioglycollate and RFTM media, and the characteristics of numerous RFTM-based diagnostic assays that have been developed and used worldwide since 1952 for detection and identification of Perkinsus spp. in host mollusc tissues and environmental samples. We also review applications of RFTM for in vitro manipulations and purifications of Perkinsus sp. pathogen cells.",0
"A bacteria-parasite challenge model was used to study the role of sea lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Copepoda), as a vector of Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. Three hypotheses were tested: (i) L. salmonis can acquire A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida via water bath exposure; (ii) L. salmonis can acquire the bacteria via parasitizing infected Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar; and (iii) L. salmonis can transmit the bacteria to naive Atlantic salmon via parasitism. Adult L. salmonis exposed to varying A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida suspensions (10(1) -10(7) cells mL(-1) ) for 1.0, 3.0 or 6.0 h acquired the bacteria externally (12.5-100%) and internally (10.0-100%), with higher prevalences associated with the highest concentrations and exposures. After exposure to 10(7) cells mL(-1) , viable A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida could be isolated from the external carapace of L. salmonis for 120 h. Lepeophtheirus salmonis also acquired the bacteria externally and internally from parasitizing infected fish. Bacterial transmission was observed only when L. salmonis had acquired the pathogen internally via feeding on 'donor fish' and then by parasitizing smaller (<50 g) 'naive' fish. Under specific experimental conditions, L. salmonis can transfer A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida via parasitism; however, its role as a mechanical or biological vector was not defined.",0
"Seafood consumption is known to confer nutritional benefits and risks from contaminant exposure. Avid seafood consumers are neither well-characterized with regard to their demographic profile nor their underlying risk-benefit profile. Contaminants [e.g., mercury (Hg)] and nutrients [e.g., selenium (Se), omega-3 fatty acids] are prevalent in some seafood. Participants (N = 285) recruited on Long Island, NY, completed food frequency and health questionnaires and received blood draws analyzed for Hg, omega-3s, and Se. Participants were categorized based on frequency and type of seafood consumption. Logistic regression analyses evaluated relationships between seafood consumption and demographics, and were age- and sex-adjusted. t tests assessed relationships between seafood consumption patterns and biomarkers Hg, omega-3s, and Se. Consumption of both tuna and salmon was associated with older age: those aged 55-75 and over 75 years old were more likely than participants aged 18-34 to eat tuna and salmon (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.05, 4.89 and OR 3.67; 95% CI 1.20, 11.20, respectively). Males were less likely than females to eat fish other than tuna or salmon (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.34, 0.97). Caucasians were more likely to consume tuna (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.10, 0.96) or salmon and tuna (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.12, 0.91), while non-Caucasians were more likely to consume other fish types (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.45, 5.12). Total blood Hg was associated with weekly consumption of any type of fish (p = 0.01) and with salmon and tuna consumption (p = 0.01). Salmon was associated with plasma omega-3s (p = 0.01). Se was not associated with fish intake categories. Risk communicators can use these findings to influence seafood preferences of different demographic groups.",0
"Aquaculture is the most rapidly expanding food production sector and this trend is projected to continue in the coming decades. Intensification of farming methods alongside a tendency for farming higher trophic level species has led to concerns over nutrient loading of coastal waters. Where this is the case, Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) has been proposed as a best-practice management option for reducing environmental impact. Fed aquaculture can also affect metal concentrations of surrounding biota by acting as a point source of contamination or by altering the abiotic environment in a manner that affects the capacity of organisms to accumulate metals. Seaweeds are integral to IMTA in providing the inorganic nutrient extraction component of the system, however it is unknown whether their close proximity to other aquaculture operations facilitates increased metal accumulation. As a result, the effect of cultivation and growth environment on accumulation of metals in the kelp Laminaria digitata (Hudson) J.V. Lamouroux was investigated, providing the first comparative experimental data examining the effect of multi-species cultivation on trace metal content of macroalgae. Thalli of L. digitata growing wild, cultivated as a single species (mono-cultivated), and cultivated alongside organic Irish salmon aquaculture facilities (IMTA) were analysed for metal content (As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Sb, V, Zn). Cultivation in an IMTA context raised the content of Cu, Mn and V relative to that in mono-cultivated seaweeds however concentrations of metals were within the range of those from algae collected from undisturbed wild populations. Metal levels in the seaweeds do not pose a concern over inclusion as a dietary component with the possible exception of arsenic that exceeded some legislative limits. The results of this study provide novel information that can inform policy and sustainable aquaculture management practices aimed at reducing contamination of the aquatic environment and the impact on consumers. Statement of relevance This study provides the first comparative investigation of metals in seaweed from different cultivation environments and can be used to support best-practice management decisions involving IMTA. Laminaria digitata metal content was marginally increased for copper, manganese and vanadium at IMTA sites. Vanadium and antimony (emerging contaminants) in the commercially important seaweed L. digitata are reported for the first time. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Plant ingredients and processed animal proteins (PAP) are suitable alternative feedstuffs for fish feeds in aquaculture practice, although their use can introduce contaminants that are not previously associated with marine salmon and gilthead sea bream farming. Mycotoxins are well known natural contaminants in plant feed material, although they also could be present on PAPs after fungi growth during storage. The present study surveyed commercially available plant ingredients (19) and PAP (19) for a wide range of mycotoxins (18) according to the EU regulations. PAP showed only minor levels of ochratoxin A and fumonisin B1 and the mycotoxin carry-over from feeds to fillets of farmed Atlantic salmon and gilthead sea bream (two main species of European aquaculture) was performed with plant ingredient based diets. Deoxynivalenol was the most prevalent mycotoxin in wheat, wheat gluten and corn gluten cereals with levels ranging from 17 to 814 and mug kg(-1), followed by fumonisins in corn products (range 11.1-4901 mug kg(-1) for fumonisin B1+B2+B3). Overall mycotoxin levels in fish feeds reflected the feed ingredient composition and the level of contaminant in each feed ingredient. In all cases the studied ingredients and feeds showed levels of mycotoxins below maximum residue limits established by the Commission Recommendation 2006/576/EC. Following these guidelines no mycotoxin carry-over was found from feeds to edible fillets of salmonids and a typically marine fish, such as gilthead sea bream. As far we know, this is the first report of mycotoxin surveillance in farmed fish species.",1
"Fish are exposed to a wide variety of environmental stressors, such as chemicals and acute changes in temperature. Oxytetracycline (OTC) has been used as an antibiotic for many kinds of bacterial diseases in cultured fish, but excessive doses of OTC are known to cause side effects in fish and can have negative effects on their environment. In the present study, we examined stress-related biomarker expression in response to excessive doses of dietary OTC in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Fish received OTC (100 mg/kg body weight/day) orally for 2 weeks. The percentage of liver to body weight (hepatosomatic index; HSI) and plasma biochemical parameter, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, of the group fed a diet containing OTC were observed to be significantly higher than those of the control group. The total glutathione (tGSH) levels in the liver of OTC-fed fish were four fold higher than those in control fish and double the control levels in muscle and stomach. Plasma tGSH levels in OTC-fed fish were also higher than those in control fish. Expression levels of heat shock protein 70 in the liver, muscle, and stomach decreased by OTC administration. Accordingly, OTC-induced stress might increase the metabolic turnover of GSH due to consumption by scavenging oxidants generated by stress. These results concerning the changing patterns of stress-related biomarkers indicate that excessive doses of OTC fed to coho salmon induce oxidative stress, which might enhance oxidation in the body and result in damage to tissues, especially in the liver. The present results also suggest that tissue-specific damage caused by OTC might already exist in fish.",1
"Soybean meal-induced enteritis (SBMIE) is a well-described condition in the distal intestine of salmonids, and saponins have been implicated as the causal agent. However, the question remains whether saponins alone cause SBMIE. Moreover, the dose-response relationship has not been described. In a 10 week feeding trial with Atlantic salmon, a highly purified (95%) soya saponin preparation was supplemented (0, 2, 4, 6, or 10 g/kg) to two basal diets, one containing fishmeal as the major protein source (FM) and the other 25% lupin meal (LP). Saponins caused dose-dependent increases in the severity of inflammation independent of the basal diet, with concomitant alterations in digestive functions and immunological marker expression. Thus, saponins induced inflammation whether the diet contained other legume components or not. However, responses were often the same or stronger in fish fed the corresponding saponin-supplemented LP diets despite lower saponin exposure, suggesting potentiation by other legume component(s).",1
"This study aimed to determine the effect of temperature and period of postharvest storage on the microbiological quality and shelf life of raw mangrove oysters, Crassostrea brasiliana. A total of 150 dozen oysters were collected directly from the points of extraction or cultivation in southern Brazil, and in the laboratory, they were stored raw at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 degrees C for 1, 4, 8, 11, and 15 days. On each of these days, the oysters were subjected to microbiological analyses of aerobic mesophilic count, total coliforms, enterococci, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella. None of the tested samples under any storage condition showed contamination levels above those allowed by Brazilian legislation for E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, and there was no change (P > 0.05) in the counts of these microorganisms due to the temperature and/or period of oyster storage. Counts of enterococci and total coliforms showed a tendency to increase (P < 0.05) among the different temperatures tested. Raw mangrove oysters remain in safe microbiological conditions for consumption up to 8 days after harvesting, regardless of temperature, and their shelf life may be extended to 15 days if they are stored at temperatures not exceeding 15 degrees C.",0
"Raw oyster consumption is the most common route of exposure for Vibrio spp. infections in humans. Vibriosis has been increasing steadily in the United States despite efforts to reduce the incidence of the disease. Research has demonstrated that ice is effective in reducing postharvest Vibrio spp. growth in oysters but has raised concerns of possible contamination of oyster meat by filth (as indicated by the presence of fecal coliform bacteria or Clostridium perfringens). This study examined the use of ice slurries (<4.5 degrees C) to reduce Vibrio growth. Ice slurries showed rapid internal cooling of oysters, from 23.9 degrees C (75 degrees F) to 10 degrees C (50 degrees F) within 12 min. The initial bacterial loads in the ice slurry waters were near the limits of detection. Following repeated dipping of oysters into ice slurries, water samples exhibited significant (P < 0.05) increases in median levels of fecal coliforms (9.5 most probable number [MPN]/100 ml), C. perfringens (280 MPN/100 ml), Vibrio vulnificus (11,250 MPN/ml), and total Vibrio parahaemolyticus (3,900 MPN/ml). The microbial load in oyster meat, however, was unchanged after 15 min of submergence, with no significant differences (P < 0.05) in levels of filth indicator (range, 250 to 720 MPN/100 g) or Vibrio spp. (range, 9,000 to 20,000 MPN/g) bacteria. These results support the use of ice slurries as a postharvest application for rapid cooling of oysters to minimize Vibrio growth.",0
"Uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) across the intestine is suggested to occur in association with dietary lipids. Partial replacement of fish ingredients by vegetable ingredients in aquafeeds has led to increased levels of PAHs in marine farmed fish. We therefore investigated, intestinal uptake, tissue distribution and PAH metabolism after a single dose of (14)C-benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) or (14)C-phenanthrene (PHE) given to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) acclimatized to a fish oil or vegetable oil based diet. Both BaP and PHE were absorbed along the intestine. Fish oil based feed increased BaP concentration in the pyloric caeca and that of PHE in the proximal intestine. In contrast, vegetable oil increased BaP concentrations in the distal intestine. Extraction of whole body autoradiograms removed PHE-associated radiolabeling almost completely from the intestinal mucosa, but not BaP-associated radiolabeling, indicating the presence of BaP metabolites bound to cellular macromolecules. This observation correlates with the increased cyp1a expression in the proximal intestine, distal intestine and liver in the BaP exposed group. Furthermore, BaP-induced cyp1a expression was higher in the distal intestine of salmon fed fish oil compared to the vegetable oil fed group. PHE had no significant effect on cyp1a expression in any of these tissues. We conclude that dietary lipid composition affects intestinal PAH uptake. Fish oil based feed increased intestinal PAH concentrations probably due to an enhanced solubility in micelles composed of fish oil fatty acids. Increased BaP accumulation in the distal intestine of vegetable oil fed fish seems to be associated with a reduced Cyp1a-mediated BaP metabolism.",0
"A simple, fast, and cost-effective sample preparation method, previously developed and validated for the analysis of organic contaminants in fish using low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS), was evaluated for the analysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) pesticides using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sample preparation technique was based on the quick, easy, cheap, rugged, effective, and safe (QuEChERS) approach with filter-vial dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE). Incurred PBDEs and DDTs were analyzed in three types of fish with 3-10% lipid content: Pacific croaker, salmon, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material 1947 (Lake Michigan fish tissue). LPGC-MS/MS and ELISA results were in agreement: 108-111 and 65-82% accuracy ELISA versus LPGC-MS/MS results for PBDEs and DDTs, respectively. Similar detection limits were achieved for ELISA and LPGC-MS/MS. Matrix effects (MEs) were significant (e.g., -60%) for PBDE measurement in ELISA, but not a factor in the case of DDT pesticides. This study demonstrated that the sample preparation method can be adopted for semiquantitative screening analysis of fish samples by commercial kits for PBDEs and DDTs.",0
"A new reference material for the determination of (137)Cs, (90)Sr and Pu isotopes ((238)Pu and (239,240)Pu) is being developed using dried oyster matrix by Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). The oyster was collected from Tongyoung harbour, southern part of Korea and the artificial radionuclides ((137)Cs, (90)Sr, (238)Pu and (239,240)Pu) were spiked into the material. After pretreatment and processing, the material was tested for homogeneity and massic activities were determined by measuring (137)Cs, (90)Sr, (238)Pu and (239,240)Pu. The reference value and extended uncertainty for those isotopes will be reported later.",0
"Phagocyte recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an early key event for triggering the host innate immune response necessary for clearance of invading bacteria. The ability of fishes to recognise LPS has been questioned as contradictory results have been presented. We show here that monocyte/macrophage cultures from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) respond with an increased expression of inflammatory and antibacterial genes to both crude and ultrapure Escherichia coli LPS. Crude LPS produces higher induction than the ultrapure LPS type in both species in vitro as well as in vivo in cod injected with LPS. Crude LPS gave, in contrast to ultrapure LPS, an additional weak up-regulation of antiviral genes in salmon macrophages, most likely because of contaminants in the LPS preparation. Increased levels of chicken (c)-type lysozyme transcripts and enzyme activity were measured in salmon macrophages following ultrapure LPS stimulation demonstrating not only increased transcription but also translation. Simultaneous use and even pre-treatment with bovine sera suppressed the LPS-induced expression thereby reflecting the presence of transcription inhibitory components in sera. Together, these findings show that both cod and salmon recognise LPS per se and that the observed induction is highly dependent on the absence of sera.",0
"Marine organisms are exposed to low doses of anthropogenic contaminants during their entire life. Authorized amounts of radionuclides are discharged in the Channel by nuclear facilities. The Pacific oyster was used to investigate the potential impact of chronic exposure to ionizing radiation. Though we exposed larvae and spat for two weeks to much higher concentrations than those encountered near nuclear facilities, oyster growth and expression of 9 selected stress genes were not significantly changed. To determine potential DNA damage, 2year old oysters were exposed for two weeks to tritiated water. The comet assay was used to evaluate the level of DNA strand breaks in haemocytes, whilst the 'clearance rate' was used as a measure of physiological effects. Whilst other parameters did not alter, DNA damage significantly increased. Our results highlight the significance of the observed DNA damage and their potential consequences at higher levels of biological organization.",0
"For several years, low larval recruitment has been observed in Arcachon Bay, in southwest France. Exposure to pollutants could partly account for the reduction of early life stages of the Pacific oyster. This study evaluated the effects of copper and S-metolachlor in combination with salinity on the early life stages of Crassostrea gigas. Embryos were exposed to concentrations of copper (1, 10 and 50 mug L(-1)) or S-metolachlor (10, 100 and 1000 ng L(-1)) and six salinities (18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33 u.s.i). Embryotoxicity was measured by considering both the percentage of abnormalities and arrested development in D-shaped larvae. Embryo-larval development was only affected at salinities </=24 u.s.i, which have never been observed during C. gigas reproduction period in Arcachon Bay. Both contaminants had an effect at environmental concentrations. Our results suggest that copper and metolachlor toxicity was enhanced with decreasing salinity.",0

"Exposure to prolonged environmental stress can have impacts on the cellular homeostasis of aquatic organisms. The current study employed two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) to test whether exposure to impaired water quality conditions in the Sydney Harbour estuary has significantly altered the proteomes of the resident Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata). Adult S. glomerata were sampled from four bays in the estuary. Each bay consisted of a ""high-impact"" site adjacent to point sources of chemical contamination (e.g., storm drains/canals or legacy hotspots) and a ""low-impact"" site located approximately 5km away from point sources. A mixture of environmental stressors differed significantly between high- and low-impact sites. Specifically, PAHs, PCBs, tributyltin, Pb, and Zn were significantly elevated in oyster tissues from high-impact sites, together with depleted dissolved oxygen and low pH in the water column. A 2-DE proteomics analysis subsequently identified 238 protein spots across 24 2-DE gels, of which 27-50 spots differed significantly in relative intensity between high- and low-impact sites per bay. Twenty-five percent of the differential spots were identified in more than one bay. The identities of 80 protein spots were determined by mass spectrometry. HSP 70, PPIB, and radixin were the three most highly expressed differential proteins. Despite the largely unique proteomes evident in each bay, functional annotations revealed that half of the differentially expressed proteins fell into just two subcellular functional categories-energy metabolism and the cytoskeleton. These findings provide a framework to further investigate adaptation of cellular mechanisms to prolonged stress in S. glomerata.",0
"The crustacean ectoparasitic salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a major problem of Atlantic salmon aquaculture in the Northern hemisphere. Host-pathogen interactions in this system are highly complex. Resistance to the parasite involves variations in genetic background, nutrition, properties of skin, and status of the endocrine and immune systems. This study addressed the relationship between sex hormones and lice infection. Field observation revealed a sharp reduction of lice prevalence during sexual maturation with no difference between male and female fish. To determine if higher resistance against lice was related to sex hormones, post-smolt salmon were administered control feed and feeds containing 17beta-estradiol (20 mg/kg) and testosterone (25 mg/kg) during a 3-week pre-challenge period. After challenge with lice, counts were reduced 2-fold and 1.5-fold in fish that received 17beta-estradiol and testosterone, respectively. Gene expression analyses were performed from skin of salmon collected in the field trial and from the controlled lab experiment at three time points (end of feeding-before challenge, 3 days post challenge (dpc) and 16 dpc) using oligonucleotide microarray and qPCR. Differential expression was observed in genes associated with diverse biological processes. Both studies revealed similar changes of several antibacterial acute phase proteins; of note was induction of cathelicidin and down-regulation of a defensin gene. Treatment with hormones revealed their ability to modulate T helper cell (Th)-mediated immunity in skin. Enhanced protection achieved by 17beta-estradiol administration might in part be due to the skewing of Th responses away from the prototypic anti-parasitic Th2 immunity and towards the more effective Th1 responses. Multiple genes involved in wound healing, differentiation and remodelling of skin tissue were stimulated during maturation but suppressed with sex hormones. Such opposite regulation suggested that these processes were not associated with resistance to the parasite under the studied conditions. Both studies revealed regulation of a suite of genes encoding putative large mucosal proteins found exclusively in fish. Marked decrease of erythrocyte markers indicated reduced circulation while down-regulation of multiple zymogen granule membrane proteins and transporters of cholesterol and other compounds suggested limited availability of nutrients for the parasites.",0
"This study assessed the contamination extent and potential ecological and human health impacts for chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in sediments and indigenous benthic organisms along the coastal area of Huludao, China. We analyzed a total of eight species: two benthic fish species, two bivalves, two snails, and two decapod crustaceans. Cu, Zn, and Cd levels in sediment exceeded the Chinese marine sediment quality criteria. The geoaccumulation index was highest for Cd followed in a decreasing order by Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, and Cr. Metal levels were highest in the four mollusk species. The oyster and veined rapa whelk had the highest bioaccumulation factors, indicating that these two species would be well suited for monitoring the metal pollution in this area. Our comparison of estimated daily intake values for human consumption of the seafood species to the Food and Agricultural Organization-recommended daily dietary allowances indicate potential health risks from the intake of Cd from all shellfish other than our crab species and Zn intake from oyster consumption. An analysis of target hazard quotients identified noncarcinogenic health risks from Cd (in all shellfish analyzed except for our crab species), Cu, and Zn (in oysters and veined rapa whelks). Moreover, an analysis of cancer risk from Pb ingestion detected an increased risk for consumption of all shellfish except for the crab species. Health risks seem especially pronounced for the consumption of oysters and the veined rapa whelks; a seafood advisory may be warranted for these mollusks.",1
"All viruses infecting fish must cross the surface mucosal barrier to successfully enter a host. Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV), the causative agent of the economically important infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., has been shown to use the gills as its entry point. However, other entry ports have not been investigated despite the expression of virus receptors on the surface of epithelial cells in the skin, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the conjunctiva. Here we investigate the ISAV mucosal infection in Atlantic salmon after experimental immersion (bath) challenge and in farmed fish collected from a confirmed outbreak of ISA in Norway. We show for the first time evidence of early replication in several mucosal surfaces in addition to the gills, including the pectoral fin, skin and GI tract suggesting several potential entry points for the virus. Initially, the infection is localized and primarily infecting epithelial cells, however at later stages it becomes systemic, infecting the endothelial cells lining the circulatory system. Viruses of low and high virulence used in the challenge revealed possible variation in virus progression during infection at the mucosal surfaces.",0
"Estuaries around the world are in a state of decline following decades or more of overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Oysters (Ostreidae), ecosystem engineers in many estuaries, influence water quality, construct habitat, and provide food for humans and wildlife. In North America's Chesapeake Bay, once-thriving eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) populations have declined dramatically, making their restoration and conservation extremely challenging. Here we present data on oyster size and human harvest from Chesapeake Bay archaeological sites spanning approximately 3,500 y of Native American, colonial, and historical occupation. We compare oysters from archaeological sites with Pleistocene oyster reefs that existed before human harvest, modern oyster reefs, and other records of human oyster harvest from around the world. Native American fisheries were focused on nearshore oysters and were likely harvested at a rate that was sustainable over centuries to millennia, despite changing Holocene climatic conditions and sea-level rise. These data document resilience in oyster populations under long-term Native American harvest, sea-level rise, and climate change; provide context for managing modern oyster fisheries in the Chesapeake Bay and elsewhere around the world; and demonstrate an interdisciplinary approach that can be applied broadly to other fisheries.",0
"In this study, we investigate the type and quantity of selenium compounds in fish and marine organisms, using ion-pair reversed phase LC-ICP-MS, developed and applied for the analysis of Atlantic cod, Atlantic salmon, Greenland halibut, Atlantic herring, blue mussel, common crab, scallop, calanus, and Euphasia super. Of the samples examined, the lowest level of selenium was found in farmed Atlantic salmon (0.17 mg Se kg(-1) dm). The total selenium extraction efficiency by phosphate buffer was 2.5 times higher in sea plankton and shellfish samples than in fish samples. Analysis of Se species in each hydrolysate obtained by proteolysis showed the presence of selenomethionine, which constituted 41.5% of the selenium compounds detected in hydrolysates of Atlantic herring and 98.4% of those in extracts of Atlantic salmon. Inorganic compounds, such as selenates and selenites, were detected mainly in sea plankton and shellfish samples (<0.13 mg Se kg(-1) wm), although no correlation was found between the presence of inorganic compounds and total selenium concentration. The accuracy of the total selenium determination was validated using a certified reference material (oyster tissue (NIST 1566b)). A lyophilised powder of cod (Gadus morhua) was used to validate speciation analysis, enzymatic hydrolysis of lyophilised powder of cod recovered 54 +/- 6% of total selenium, and SeMet constituted 83.5 +/- 5.28% of selenium detected in hydrolysates. The chromatographic detection limits were, respectively, 0.30 ng mL(-1), 0.43 ng mL(-1), 0.54 ng mL(-1), 0.55 ng mL(-1), 0.57 ng mL(-1) and 0.72 ng mL(-1) for selenate, selenomethionine, selenite, Se-methyl-selenocysteine, selenocystine and selenomethionine selenoxide.The data on selenium concentrations and speciation presented here could be useful in estimating levels of selenium intake by seafood consumption.",0
"In this study, we successfully applied a previously modified version of the QuEChERS approach to quantify pesticide residues in samples of fresh salmon. Analysis was performed using a combination of liquid and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS). The validated QuEChERS method used ethyl acetate for the extraction solvent and involved two freezing steps and a C18 dispersive solid phase extraction for removal of lipids. Of the 228 pesticides initially screened, only 185 passed the method validation criteria (103 on LC-MS/MS and 82 on GC-MS/MS). In a quantitative validation, acceptable performances were achieved with overall recoveries of 70-120% and <20% RSD for 179 analytes (n = 7) over the course of five different extractions at 2 times the limit of quantification. Over 12 months, this method was used in the analysis of 708 salmon samples collected as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program. Ruggedness testing conducted throughout the entire study showed this method to be robust and suitable for long-term use.",0
"Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a ubiquitous virus in Norwegian salmon farms associated with the disease heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI). Experimental challenge has shown that the virus replicates in circulating red blood cells of Atlantic salmon prior to infecting heart myocytes. The infection route from water to blood is however still unknown. The related mammalian orthoreovirus primarily infects the lungs and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is proposed to spread mainly through the faecal-oral route. To investigate the role of the salmonid GI tract in PRV-infection, oral and anal administration of virus was compared to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. When administered anally, PRV was transferred to blood 4 days post challenge (dpc) and levels peaked at 42 dpc, similar to i.p. injected fish. PRV was detected in heart and faeces with corresponding kinetics, and inflammatory heart lesions consistent with HSMI were observed from 49 dpc. The orally intubated group showed slower virus kinetics in both blood and heart, and no signs of HSMI. Compared to the oral and i.p. administration routes, leakage of virus inoculate by anal intubation was minor and challenge was restricted to the mid- and distal intestine. These findings show that anal intubation is an efficacious method for PRV delivery to the GI tract and demonstrates that PRV can establish infection through the intestine with the potential for transmission via faeces.",0
"Paralytic Shellfish Toxin blooms are common worldwide, which makes their monitoring crucial in the prevention of poisoning incidents. These toxins can be monitored by a variety of techniques, including mouse bioassay, receptor binding assay, and liquid chromatography with either mass spectrometric or pre- or post-column fluorescence detection. The post-column oxidation liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection method, used routinely in our laboratory, has been shown to be a reliable method for monitoring paralytic shellfish toxins in mussel, scallop, oyster and clam species. However, due to its high sensitivity to naturally fluorescent matrix interferences, when working with unconventional matrices, there may be problems in identifying toxins because of naturally fluorescent interferences that co-elute with the toxin peaks. This can lead to erroneous identification. In this study, in order to overcome this challenge in echinoderm and gastropod matrices, we optimized the conversion of Gonyautoxins 1 and 4 to Neosaxitoxin with 2-mercaptoethanol. We present a new and less time-consuming method with a good recovery (82.2%, RSD 1.1%, n = 3), requiring only a single reaction step.",0
"Reports from state health departments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the annual number of reported human vibriosis cases in New England has increased in the past decade. Concurrently, there has been a shift in both the spatial distribution and seasonal detection of Vibrio spp. throughout the region based on limited monitoring data. To determine environmental factors that may underlie these emerging conditions, this study focuses on a long-term database of Vibrio parahaemolyticus concentrations in oyster samples generated from data collected from the Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire over a period of seven consecutive years. Oyster samples from two distinct sites were analyzed for V. parahaemolyticus abundance, noting significant relationships with various biotic and abiotic factors measured during the same period of study. We developed a predictive modeling tool capable of estimating the likelihood of V. parahaemolyticus presence in coastal New Hampshire oysters. Results show that the inclusion of chlorophyll a concentration to an empirical model otherwise employing only temperature and salinity variables, offers improved predictive capability for modeling the likelihood of V. parahaemolyticus in the Great Bay Estuary.",1
"Pancreas disease (PD) is a viral disease caused by Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) that affects farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)) in the seawater phase. Since its first description in Scotland in 1976, a large number of studies have been conducted relating to the disease itself and to factors contributing to agent spread and disease occurrence. This paper summarizes the currently available, scientific information on the epidemiology of PD and its associated mitigation and control measures. Available literature shows infected farmed salmonids to be the main reservoir of SAV. Transmission between seawater sites occurs mainly passively by water currents or actively through human activity coupled with inadequate biosecurity measures. All available information suggests that the current fallowing procedures are adequate to prevent agent survival within the environment through the fallowing period and thus that a repeated disease outbreak at the same site is due to a new agent introduction. There has been no scientific evaluation of currently used on-site biosecurity measures, and there is limited information on the impact of available mitigation measures and control strategies.",0
"The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes arthritic diseases in humans, whereas the aquatic salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is associated with high mortality in aquaculture of salmon and trout. Using modern biotechnological approaches, promising vaccine candidates based upon highly immunogenic, enveloped virus-like particles (eVLPs) have been developed. However, the eVLP structure (core, lipid membrane, surface glycoproteins) is more complex than that of non-enveloped, protein-only VLPs, which are structurally and morphologically 'simple'. In order to develop an alternative to alphavirus eVLPs, in this paper we engineered recombinant baculovirus vectors to produce high levels of alphavirus core-like particles (CLPs) in insect cells by expression of the CHIKV and SAV capsid proteins. The CLPs localize in dense nuclear bodies within the infected cell nucleus and are purified through a rapid and scalable protocol involving cell lysis, sonication and low-speed centrifugation steps. Furthermore, an immunogenic epitope from the alphavirus E2 glycoprotein can be successfully fused to the N-terminus of the capsid protein without disrupting the CLP self-assembling properties. We propose that immunogenic epitope-tagged alphavirus CLPs produced in insect cells present a simple and perhaps more stable alternative to alphavirus eVLPs.",0
"A collaborative study was conducted to determine selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their relevant alkyl homologs in seafood matrixes using a fast sample preparation method followed by analysis with GC/MS. The sample preparation method involves addition of (13)C-PAH surrogate mixture to homogenized samples and extraction by shaking with a water-ethyl acetate mixture. After phase separation induced by addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate-sodium chloride (2 + 1, w/w) and centrifugation, an aliquot of the ethyl acetate layer is evaporated, reconstituted in hexane, and cleaned up using silica gel SPE. The analytes are eluted with hexane-dichloromethane (3 + 1, v/v), the clean extract is carefully evaporated, reconstituted in isooctane, and analyzed by GC/MS. To allow for the use of various GC/MS instruments, GC columns, silica SPE cartridges, and evaporation techniques and equipment, performance-based criteria were developed and implemented in the qualification phase of the collaborative study. These criteria helped laboratories optimize their GC/MS, SPE cleanup, and evaporation conditions; check and eliminate potential PAH contamination in their reagent blanks; and become familiar with the method procedure. Ten laboratories from five countries qualified and completed the collaborative study, which was conducted on three seafood matrixes (mussel, oyster, and shrimp) fortified with 19 selected PAH analytes at five different levels of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) ranging from 2 to 50 mug/kg. Each matrix had a varying mixture of three different BaP levels. The other studied PAHs were at varying levels from 2 to 250 mug/kg to mimic typical PAH patterns. The fortified analytes in three matrixes were analyzed as blind duplicates at each level of BaP and corresponding other PAH levels. In addition, a blank with no added PAHs for each matrix was analyzed singly. Eight to 10 valid results were obtained for the majority of determinations. Mean recoveries of all tested analytes at the five different concentration levels were all in the range of 70-120%: 83.8-115% in shrimp, 77.3-107% in mussel, and 71.6-94.6% in oyster, except for a slightly lower mean recovery of 68.6% for benzo[ a ]anthracene fortified at 25 mug/kg in oyster (RSDr: 5.84%, RSDR: 21.1%) and lower mean recoveries for anthracene (Ant) and BaP in oyster at all three fortification levels (50.3-56.5% and 48.2-49.7%, respectively). The lower mean recoveries of Ant and BaP were linked to degradation of these analytes in oyster samples stored at -20 degrees C, which also resulted in lower reproducibility (RSDR values in the range of 44.5-64.7% for Ant and 40.6-43.5% for BaP). However, the repeatability was good (RSDr of 8.78-9.96% for Ant and 6.43-11.9% for BaP), and the HorRat values were acceptable (1.56-1.94 for Ant and 1.10-1.45 for BaP). In all other cases, repeatability, reproducibility, and HorRat values were as follows: shrimp: RSDr 1.40-26.9%, RSDR 5.41-29.4%, HorRat: 0.22-1.34; mussel: RSDr 2.52-17.1%, RSDR 4.19-32.5%, HorRat: 0.17-1.13; and oyster: RSDr 3.12-22.7%, RSDR 8.41-31.8%, HorRat: 0.34-1.39. The results demonstrate that the method is fit-for-purpose to determine PAHs and their alkyl homologs in seafood samples. The method was approved by the Expert Review Panel on PAHs as the AOAC Official First Action Method 2014.08.",0
"During its parasitic life stages, the marine ectoparasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis ingests large amounts of host blood, which contains high amounts of iron. Iron is an essential micronutrient, but also toxic in high dosages, and blood-feeding parasites like the salmon louse must thus possess an efficient system to handle the excess iron. Iron regulatory protein 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2) are known to play crucial roles in this process, by regulating several proteins involved in iron transport and storage, depending on the cellular iron concentration. To gain knowledge about the regulation of the iron metabolism in salmon lice, two IRP homologues (LsIRP1A and LsIRP1B) were identified by sequence and predicted structure similarity to known IRPs in other species. In situ hybridisation revealed that LsIRP1A and LsIRP1B mRNAs were expressed in the ovaries, oviducts and vitellogenic oocytes of adult females. Transcription levels of LsIRP1A and LsIRP1B mRNAs did not differ significantly between the different developmental stages of the salmon louse. Adults in the absence of blood as a feed source had decreased levels of LsIRP1A, but not LsIRP1B mRNA. RNA binding experiments indicated the presence of functioning IRP in salmon lice. In order to explore the biological functions of LsIRP1A and LsIRP1B, the mRNAs of both proteins were knocked down by RNA interference (RNAi) in preadult females. The knockdown was confirmed by qRT-PCR. LsIRP1B knockdown lice produced less offspring than control lice due to slightly shorter egg strings and had decreased levels of transcripts involved in egg development. Knockdown of both LsIRP1A and LsIRP1B caused increased expression of a salmon louse Ferritin (LsFer). These results confirm that salmon lice have two IRP1 homologues, LsIRP1A and LsIRP1B, and might suggest a function in cellular iron regulation in the reproductive organs and eggs.",0
"Assessing the environmental impact of salmon farms on benthic systems is traditionally undertaken using biotic indices derived from microscopic analyses of macrobenthic infaunal (MI) communities. In this study, we tested the applicability of using foraminiferal-specific high-throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcoding for monitoring these habitats. Sediment samples and physico-chemical data were collected along an enrichment gradient radiating out from three Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farms in New Zealand. HTS of environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/eRNA) resulted in 1,875,300 sequences that clustered into 349 Operational Taxonomic Units. Strong correlations were observed among various biotic indices calculated from MI data and normalized fourth-root transformed HTS data. Correlations were stronger using eRNA compared to eDNA data. Quantile regression spline analyses identified 12 key foraminiferal taxa that have potential to be used as bioindicator species. This study demonstrates the huge potential for using this method for biomonitoring of fish-farming and other marine industrial activities.",0
"Thirty-six sediment samples were collected from six mariculture sites and corresponding reference sites (approximately 200-300 m away from each mariculture site) to study the effects of mariculture on heavy metal: copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) distribution in sediments and cultured fish around the Pearl River Delta region, south China. The mean concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cr and Pb in all mariculture sediment samples were 109, 273, 99 and 33 mg/kg, compared with 63, 209, 56 and 23 mg/kg for reference sediment samples, respectively. The Pollution Load Index of sediment for each site was over 1, implying substantial heavy metal pollution. The results of principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis indicate that marine aquaculture activities have enriched the surface sediments underneath mariculture rafts with Cu, Zn and Pb, possibly due to the accumulation of unconsumed fish feeds, fish excreta and antifouling paints (except Cr). Two kinds of fish feeds, feed pellets and trash fish commonly used in Hong Kong were analyzed. The concentrations of Zn and Cu contained in feed pellets were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in trash fish due to addition of these elements as growth promoters during pellet production. However, the Pb content in trash fish (due to contamination) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in feed pellets. Three cultured fish species, namely red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) and snubnose pompano (Trachinotus blochii), were collected from each mariculture site for metal analysis. Lead concentrations in 21 fish samples exceeded the Chinese safety guideline (0.5 mg/kg, GB18406.4-2001), indicating that Pb contamination in cultured fish would be a public health concern.",1
"The antimicrobial film-coating requirements for obtaining protection against Listeria monocytogenes in smoked salmon using a defatted mustard meal-based antimicrobial edible film (DMM film) were predicted by fitting a mathematical model to the experimental data. The concentration of thiocyanate ion (SCN-) (0.28 0.02 mg/g) inhibiting L. monocytogenes (4.0 0.2 log CFU/g) as well as diffusion and partition coefficients of SCN- in smoked salmon coated with the film were experimentally determined for prediction. The diffusion coefficients for the SCN- diffusion in the film and in the salmon at 4 √ÅC and the partition coefficient were 2.7 * 10-14 m2/s, 1.9 * 10-10 m2/s, and 0.8, respectively. The film containing an SCN- at 0.41 mg/g was predicted to provide 19.7 h of protection in smoked salmon against continuous-post-contamination by L. monocytogenes at 4.0 log CFU/g during which SCN- remains above the inhibitory concentration of 0.28 mg/g. For 24 h inhibition, the necessary initial concentration of SCN- was estimated as 0.43 mg/g in a 0.14 mm thick film. The methods developed in this study allow for the prediction of antimicrobial DMM film requirements in the protection of smoked salmon against L. monocytogenes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Oysters are filter-feeding bivalve molluscs that are associated with several foodborne illnesses, because they accumulate biotic and abiotic contaminants dispersed in the water. The state of Parana in southern Brazil is distinguished by a high consumption of oysters, typically eaten raw, and this habit may present a risk to consumer health if the product is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria. This study intends to evaluate the microbiological quality of oysters produced and traded in Parana, directly examining the localities of cultivation and trading of the product. The major sites for the trading of oysters in the state were identified and 52 dozen oysters (624 animals) were collected from these places, between April and December, 2013. The samples were subjected to analyses for total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella spp. No samples had results of microbial contamination above the limits established by Brazilian legislation. This study indicated that the microbiological quality of the oysters produced and traded in the state of Parana is acceptable.",0
"The role of escaped farmed salmon in spreading infectious agents from aquaculture to wild salmonid populations is largely unknown. This is a case study of potential disease interaction between escaped farmed and wild fish populations. In summer 2012, significant numbers of farmed Atlantic salmon were captured in the Hardangerfjord and in a local river. Genetic analyses of 59 of the escaped salmon and samples collected from six local salmon farms pointed out the most likely source farm, but two other farms had an overlapping genetic profile. The escapees were also analysed for three viruses that are prevalent in fish farming in Norway. Almost all the escaped salmon were infected with salmon alphavirus (SAV) and piscine reovirus (PRV). To use the infection profile to assist genetic methods in identifying the likely farm of origin, samples from the farms were also tested for these viruses. However, in the current case, all the three farms had an infection profile that was similar to that of the escapees. We have shown that double-virus-infected escaped salmon ascend a river close to the likely source farms, reinforcing the potential for spread of viruses to wild salmonids.",1
"The aim of this study was to determine 1) the relevance of using the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas as a sentinel organism, at a juvenile stage, for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and persistent organic pollutant (polychlorobiphenyl, PCB, polybromodimethylether, PBDE, and organochlorine pesticide, OCP) contamination, 2) the potential levels of chemical organic contamination in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, and their potential sources and 3) the potential influence of physiological or environmental factors on contaminant body burdens in oysters. To this end, juvenile oysters purchased from an oyster hatchery were transplanted to a reference site, in Bouin, and to different transplantation sites in the Marennes-Oleron Bay, the first oyster production area in France, and in the Gironde Estuary, the biggest estuary in Occidental Europe. Transplantations were done during summer and winter. Whole oyster soft tissues from each site were analysed for PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs and OCPs. Results obtained with a transplantation period of 3months suggest that C. gigas, at the juvenile stage, is a relevant sentinel organism for short-term assessment of contamination for these contaminants. In addition, no significant effects of physiological factors on contaminant body burdens were observed. Principal component analysis revealed two distinct groups of contaminants (PAHs and OPCs, and PCBs and PBDEs) and three groups of sites: 1) the reference site, 2) Les Palles (LP) and Boyard (BOY) in winter and 3) all the other sites. The group of LP and BOY was clearly defined by the levels of PAHs and OCPs, suggesting higher levels of contamination of these chemical compounds on these sites, potentially due to local contamination sources. In addition, no relevant effects of physiological or environmental factors on contaminant body burdens were observed. Results suggest also a predominance of contaminants related to agricultural activities along the Marennes-Oleron Bay, and therefore, further studies on the presence of pesticides in this region should be considered.",0
"The insect chemoreceptor superfamily consists of 2 gene families, the highly diverse gustatory receptors (GRs) found in all arthropods with sequenced genomes and the odorant receptors that evolved from a GR lineage and have been found only in insects to date. Here, I describe relatives of the insect chemoreceptor superfamily, specifically the basal GR family, in diverse other animals, showing that the superfamily dates back at least to early animal evolution. GR-Like (GRL) genes are present in the genomes of the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens, an anemone Nematostella vectensis, a coral Acropora digitifera, a polychaete Capitella teleta, a leech Helobdella robusta, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (and many other nematodes), 3 molluscs (a limpet Lottia gigantea, an oyster Crassostrea gigas, and the sea hare Aplysia californica), the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and the sea acorn Saccoglossus kowalevskii. While some of these animals contain multiple divergent GRL lineages, GRLs have been lost entirely from other animal lineages such as vertebrates. GRLs are absent from the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, and 2 available chaonoflagellate genomes, so it remains unclear whether this superfamily originated before or during animal evolution.",0
"Double-stranded salmon DNA (SDNA) was doped with doxorubicin hydrochloride drug molecules (DOX) to determine the binding between DOX and SDNA, and DOX optimum doping concentration in SDNA. SDNA thin films were prepared with various concentrations of DOX by drop-casting on oxygen plasma treated glass and quartz substrates. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate the binding sites for DOX in SDNA, and electrical and photoluminescence (PL) analyses were used to determine the optimum doping concentration of DOX. The FTIR spectra showed that up to a concentration of 30 muM of DOX, there was a tendency for binding with a periodic orientation via intercalation between nucleosides. The current and PL intensity increased as the DOX concentration increased up to 30 muM, and then as the concentration of DOX further increased, we observed a decrease in current as well as PL quenching. Finally, the optical band gap and second band onset of the transmittance spectra were analyzed to further verify the DOX binding and optimum doping concentration into SDNA thin films as a function of the DOX concentration.",0
"BACKGROUND: Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is an emerging disease of marine-farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, first recognized in 1999 in Norway, and recently associated with piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) infection. To date, HSMI lesions with presence of PRV have only been described in marine-farmed Atlantic salmon in Norway. A new HSMI-like disease in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss associated with a PRV-related virus has also been reported in Norway. METHODS: Sampling of Atlantic salmon and coho salmon was done during potential disease outbreaks, targeting lethargic/moribund fish. Fish were necropsied and tissues were taken for histopathologic analysis and testing for PRV by RT-qPCR assay for segment L1 and conventional RT-PCR for PRV segment S1. The PCR products were sequenced and their relationship to PRV strains in GenBank was determined using phylogenetic analysis and nucleotide and amino acid homology comparisons. RESULTS: The Atlantic salmon manifested the classical presentation of HSMI with high PRV virus loads (low Ct values) as described in Norway. The coho salmon with low Ct values had myocarditis but only in the spongy layer, the myositis of red muscle in general was mild, and the hepatic necrosis was severe. Upon phylogenetic analysis of PRV segment S1 sequences, all the Chilean PRV strains from Atlantic salmon grouped as sub-genotype Ib, whereas the Chilean PRV strains from coho salmon were more diversified, grouping in both sub-genotypes Ia and Ib and others forming a distinct new phylogenetic cluster, designated Genotype II that included the Norwegian PRV-related virus. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge the present work constitutes the first published report of HSMI lesions with presence of PRV in farmed Atlantic salmon outside of Europe, and the first report of HSMI-like lesions with presence of PRV in coho salmon in Chile. The Chilean PRV strains from coho salmon are more genetically diversified than those from Atlantic salmon, and some form a distinct new phylogenetic cluster, designated Genotype II.",1
"Effective disease management can benefit from mathematical models that identify drivers of epidemiological change and guide decision-making. This is well illustrated in the host-parasite system of sea lice and salmon, which has been modelled extensively due to the economic costs associated with sea louse infections on salmon farms and the conservation concerns associated with sea louse infections on wild salmon. Consequently, a rich modelling literature devoted to sea louse and salmon epidemiology has been developed. We provide a synthesis of the mathematical and statistical models that have been used to study the epidemiology of sea lice and salmon. These studies span both conceptual and tactical models to quantify the effects of infections on host populations and communities, describe and predict patterns of transmission and dispersal, and guide evidence-based management of wild and farmed salmon. As aquaculture production continues to increase, advances made in modelling sea louse and salmon epidemiology should inform the sustainable management of marine resources.",0
"An acute gastroenteritis (AGE) outbreak was reported in May 2013 in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. Eight students who had eaten breakfast on 21 May 2013 at a high-school restaurant exhibited AGE symptoms. Our case-control study showed that a strong association was observed between AGE symptoms and fermented oyster consumption. Virological studies also indicated that noroviruses (NoVs) were detected from both clinical samples and fermented oyster samples, and multiple different genotypes (genogroups GII.4, GII.11 and GII.14) of NoVs were present in both samples. The nucleotide sequence similarity between the strains found in the clinical samples and those in the fermented oysters was more than 99.5%. Therefore, to prevent further outbreaks, proper management of raw oysters is necessary and the food industry should be aware of the risk of viral gastroenteritis posed by fermented oysters contaminated with NoVs.",0
"Water-soluble polysaccharide was extracted from Crassostrea gigas by hydrolysis with flavourzyme and filtered, ultrafiltered and precipitated using absolute ethanol. Sugar composition analysis performed on the C. gigas polysaccharide (CGP) by high performance liquid chromatography indicated that it was comprised primarily of glucose, and its molecular weight was determined using a TSK-GEL G5000PW column to be approximately 3.413x10(6) Da. Next, the antihypertensive activity of CGP was evaluated in rats. Hypertension model Wistar rats were divided into three groups and intragastrically treated with physiological saline (negative control group), CGP (treatment group), and captopril (positive control group). CGP treatment led to significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic pressures in the hypertension model Wistar rats. Furthermore, the antihypertensive effect of CGP was comparable with that of captopril. Thus, CGP has antihypertensive effects and can potentially be used as a therapeutic agent for hypertension.",0
"Oyster contamination by noroviruses is an important health and economic problem. The present study aimed to compare the behaviors of Norwalk virus (the prototype genogroup I norovirus) and two culturable viruses: Tulane virus and mengovirus. After bioaccumulation, tissue distributions were quite similar for Norwalk virus and Tulane virus, with the majority of viral particles detected in digestive tissues, while mengovirus was detected in large amounts in the gills and mantle as well as in digestive tissues. The levels of persistence of all three viruses over 8 days were comparable, but clear differences were observed over longer periods, with Norwalk and Tulane viruses displaying rather similar half-lives, unlike mengovirus, which was cleared more rapidly. These results indicate that Tulane virus may be a good surrogate for studying norovirus behavior in oysters, and they confirm the prolonged persistence of Norwalk virus in oyster tissues.",0
"The Kuril Islands region is considered promising for development of salmon aquaculture. There are 41 salmon fish hatcheries in the Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands, 34 of them are hatcheries of the chum. Therefore, concentrations of six elements (Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, As, and Hg) were determined in chum salmon were caught in this region. The contents of toxic elements (Cd, Pb, As, and Hg) don't exceed their maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) according to the Russian sanitary standards, but concentration of Pb are closely to MPC. Increased concentrations of Pb in wild chum have the natural origin. The unusual conditions of the Western Pacific are formed under the influence such factors as volcanism and upwelling.

"Renibacterium salmoninarum is a significant pathogen of salmonids and the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease (BKD). Water temperature affects the replication rate of pathogens and the function of the fish immune system to influence the progression of disease. In addition, rapid shifts in temperature may serve as stressors that reduce host resistance. This study evaluated the effect of shifts in water temperature on established R. salmoninarum infections. We challenged Chinook salmon with R. salmoninarum at 12 degrees C for 2 weeks and then divided the fish into three temperature groups (8, 12 and 15 degrees C). Fish in the 8 degrees C group had significantly higher R. salmoninarum-specific mortality, kidney R. salmoninarum loads and bacterial shedding rates relative to the fish held at 12 or 15 degrees C. There was a trend towards suppressed bacterial load and shedding in the 15 degrees C group, but the results were not significant. Bacterial load was a significant predictor of shedding for the 8 and 12 degrees C groups but not for the 15 degrees C group. Overall, our results showed little effect of temperature stress on the progress of infection, but do support the conclusion that cooler water temperatures contribute to infection progression and increased transmission potential in Chinook salmon infected with R. salmoninarum.",0
"C1q proteins serve as pattern recognition receptors and involve in the pathogen recognition and complement pathway activation. In the present study, a novel C1q domain containing protein from Crassostrea gigas (designated CgC1qDC-1) was isolated by liposaccharide-Sepharose 6B affinity chromatography. The coding sequence of CgC1qDC-1 gene was determined by performing a homologous search of eight tryptic peptides identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS against the genome of C. gigas. The coding sequence of CgC1qDC-1 was of 387 bp encoding a polypeptide of 128 amino acids containing a typical globular C1q domain. The globular C1q domain possessed eight beta strands with a jelly-roll topology structure, which was similar to the structure of human gC1q domain. The mRNA transcripts of CgC1qDC-1 were dominantly expressed in mantle and hemocytes, while low expressed in hepatopancreas, gonad, gill and muscle. The expression level of CgC1qDC-1 increased drastically at 6 h after Vibrio splendidus stimulation, and then gradually fell to the normal level at about 24 h. ELISA assay quantified that CgC1qDC-1 bound to LPS with high binding affinity (Kd = 0.09 x 10(-6) M). Moreover, CgC1qDC-1 significantly enhanced the phagocytosis of oyster hemocytes towards Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and V. splendidus. These results collectively indicated that CgC1qDC-1 could serve as pattern recognition receptor and opsonin in the innate immune response against invading Gram-negative bacteria.",0
"Little is known about the response of non-model invertebrates, such as oysters, to virus infection. The vertebrate innate immune system detects virus-derived nucleic acids to trigger the type I IFN pathway, leading to the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that exert antiviral functions. Invertebrates were thought to lack the IFN pathway based on the absence of IFN or ISGs encoded in model invertebrate genomes. However, the oyster genome encodes many ISGs, including the well-described antiviral protein viperin. In this study, we characterized oyster viperin and showed that it localizes to caveolin-1 and inhibits dengue virus replication in a heterologous model. In a second set of experiments, we have provided evidence that the haemolymph from poly(I : C)-injected oysters contains a heat-stable, protease-susceptible factor that induces haemocyte transcription of viperin mRNA in conjunction with upregulation of IFN regulatory factor. Collectively, these results support the concept that oysters have antiviral systems that are homologous to the vertebrate IFN pathway.",0
"The effects of hypoxia and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), given singly and also in combination on endocrine, biotransformation, and oxidative stress responses were investigated in primary culture of salmon hepatocytes. Hypoxia was induced chemically using cobalt chloride (CoCl2) or deferroxamine (DFO). Primary culture of salmon hepatocytes were exposed to either CoCl2 (150 muM) or DFO (100 muM), in the presence or absence of PFOSA at 0, 25, and 50 muM for 24 and 48 h. Changes in transcript levels were analyzed by quantitative (real-time) PCR using gene-specific primers. CYP, catalase, GST, and SOD activities were analyzed spectrophotometrically. The hif-1alpha mRNA was used to validate cellular hypoxic condition, showing significantly induced transcription after 48-h exposure to DFO and CoCl2. Our data show that transcript levels for endocrine (ERalpha, Vtg, and Zrp), biotransformation (cyp1a, cyp3a, gst, and udpgt), and oxidative stress responses (catalase (cat), glutathione peroxidase (gpx), and glutathione reductase (gr)) were differentially modulated by PFOSA and hypoxia alone, and these effects were dependent on the response parameters and time of exposure. In combined exposure scenarios, the observed effects were apparently hypoxia-dependent. However, the observed effects at transcript levels were not concomitant with those at functional protein levels, further emphasizing the potential differences that may exist between these biological levels. Biplot of principal component analysis (PCA) showed grouping of response variables after 48 h of exposure. The distribution of observations and variables indicate that PFOSA had little effect on most response variables, while clustering show a unique association between a given hypoxia condition (i.e., CoCl2 or DFO) in combination with PFOSA and transcripts, proteins, or enzyme activities.",0
"Aggregation is commonly observed for macroparasites, but its adaptive value remains unclear. Heavy infestations intensities may lead to a decrease in some fitness-related traits of parasites (e.g. parasite fecundity or survival). However, to a dioecious parasite, increased aggregation could also increase the chance of finding individuals of the opposite sex. In a laboratory experiment, we tested if previous experience with salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) affected susceptibility of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to later exposure to the same parasite species. We found that currently infected fish got higher intensities of new lice than naive fish. This suggests that hosts already carrying parasites are more susceptible to new lice infections. For this dioecious parasite, such positive density dependence might be adaptive, ensuring successful reproduction under conditions of low lice densities by increasing the probability of both sexes infecting the same host.",0
"Oysters are widely consumed seafood, but their shells impose a serious environmental problem. To extend the utilization of oyster shell waste, we investigated the biological role of oyster shell extract. In this study, we verified that the ethanol extract of oyster shell (EOS) contains taurine and betaine, the major components of oyster body. EOS downregulated transcription of Sptlc1 and Sptlc2 mRNA, the subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). Suppression of SPT subunits reduced sphinganine and sphingomyelin by inhibiting de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. Inhibition of sphingomyelin biosynthesis resulted in downregulation of lipogenic gene expression such as ACC, FAS, SCD1, and DGAT2. Consistent with inhibition of lipogenesis, cellular triglyceride levels were diminished by EOS, but cholesterol levels were not altered. Taken together, these results suggest that EOS has a lipid-lowering effect and could be applied as either a therapeutic or preventive measure for metabolic dysfunction.",0
"UNLABELLED: The use of a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) technique has identified the intraspecific genetic diversity of U.S. Flavobacterium psychrophilum, an important pathogen of salmonids worldwide. Prior to this analysis, little U.S. F. psychrophilum genetic information was known; this is of importance when considering targeted control strategies, including vaccine development. Herein, MLST was used to investigate the genetic diversity of 96 F. psychrophilum isolates recovered from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that originated from nine U.S. states. The isolates fell into 34 distinct sequence types (STs) that clustered in 5 clonal complexes (CCs) (n = 63) or were singletons (n = 33). The distribution of STs varied spatially, by host species, and in association with mortality events. Several STs (i.e., ST9, ST10, ST30, and ST78) were found in multiple states, whereas the remaining STs were localized to single states. With the exception of ST256, which was recovered from rainbow trout and Chinook salmon, all STs were found to infect a single host species. Isolates that were collected during bacterial cold water disease outbreaks most frequently belonged to CC-ST10 (e.g., ST10 and ST78). Collectively, the results of this study clearly demonstrate the genetic diversity of F. psychrophilum within the United States and identify STs of clinical significance. Although the majority of STs described herein were novel, some (e.g., ST9, ST10, ST13, ST30, and ST31) were previously recovered on other continents, which demonstrates the transcontinental distribution of F. psychrophilum genotypes. IMPORTANCE: Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the causative agent of bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) and rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS) and is an important bacterial pathogen of wild and farmed salmonids worldwide. These infections are responsible for large economic losses globally, yet the genetic diversity of this pathogen remains to be fully investigated. Previous studies have identified the genetic diversity of this pathogen in other main aquaculture regions; however, little effort has been focused on the United States. In this context, this study aims to examine the genetic diversity of F. psychrophilum from the United States, as this region remains important in salmonid aquaculture.",0
"A total of 44 samples of salmon, pangasius (shark catfish), shrimps, and oysters were tested for the presence of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, which are indicator organisms commonly used in programs to monitor antibiotic resistance. The isolated bacterial strains, confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, were tested against a panel of 29 antimicrobial agents to obtain MICs. Across the four sample types, Enterococcus faecalis (59%) was most common, followed by E. coli (55%), P. aeruginosa (27%), and S. aureus (9%). All bacterial species were resistant to some antibiotics. The highest rates of resistance were in E. faecalis to tetracycline (16%), in E. coli to ciprofloxacin (22%), and in S. aureus to penicillin (56%). Antibiotic resistance was found among all sample types, but salmon and oysters were less burdened than were shrimps and pangasius. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains were exclusively found in shrimps and pangasius: 17% of pangasius samples (MDR E. coli and S. aureus) and 64% of shrimps (MDR E. coli, E. faecalis, and S. aureus). Two of these MDR E. coli isolates from shrimps (one from an organic sample) were resistant to seven antimicrobial agents. Based on these findings, E. coli in pangasius, shrimps, and oysters, E. faecalis in pangasius, shrimps, and salmon, and P. aeruginosa in pangasius and shrimps are potential candidates for programs monitoring antimicrobial resistance. Enrichment methods for the detection of MDR bacteria of special public health concern, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus and E. coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases, should be implemented.",0
"A novel, selective, rapid and simple electrochemical method is developed for the determination of atropine sulfate. UV-Vis and differential pulse voltammetry are used to study the interaction of atropine sulfate with salmon sperm ds-DNA on the surface of salmon sperm ds-DNA modified-pencil graphite electrode (PGE). For this purpose, a pencil graphite electrode (PGE) modified with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs), and poly-dialyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) decorated with ds-DNA is tested for the determination of atropine sulfate. The electrochemical oxidation peak current of adenine and guanine bonded on the surface of ds-DNA/PDDA-TiO2NPs-MWCNTs/PGE is used to obtain the analytical signal. Decreases in the intensities of guanine and adenine oxidation signals after their interaction with atropine sulfate are used as indicator signals for the sensitive determination of atropine sulfate. Using ds-DNA/PDDA-TiO2NPs-MWCNTs/PGE and based on the guanine signal, linear calibration curves were obtained in the range of 0.6 to 30.0 mumol L(-1) and 30.0 to 600.0 mumol L(-1) atropine sulfate with low detection limits of 30.0 nmol L(-1). The biosensor shows a good selectivity for the determination of atropine sulfate. Finally, the applicability of the biosensor is evaluated by measuring atropine sulfate in real samples with good accuracy.",0
"Estrogen receptors (ers) not only are activated by hormones but also interact with many human-derived environmental contaminants. Here, we present evidence for four expressed er genes in Atlantic salmon cDNA - two more ers (eralpha2 and erbeta2) than previously published. To determine if er gene expression differs between two adult life-stages we sampled 20 adult salmon from the feeding phase in the Baltic Sea and during migration in the River Morrum, Sweden. Results show that all four er genes are present in the investigated tissues, except for eralpha2 not appearing in the spleen. Overall, a profile analysis reveals the eralpha1 gene to be the most highly expressed er gene in both female and male Baltic Sea salmon tissues, and also in female River Morrum salmon. In contrast, this gene has the lowest gene expression level of the four er genes in male salmon from the River Morrum. The eralpha2 gene is expressed at the lowest levels in both female/male Baltic Sea salmon and in female River Morrum salmon. Statistical analyses indicate a significant and complex interaction where both sex and adult life stage can impact er gene expression. Regression analyses did not demonstrate any significant relationship between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) body burden and er gene expression level, suggesting that accumulated pollutants from the Baltic Sea may be deactivated inside the salmon's lipid tissues and have limited impact on er activity. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of four er gene expression levels in two wild salmon populations from two different adult life stages where information about PCB load is also available.",0
"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the primary target for organophosphates (OP). Several mutations have been reported in AChE to be associated with the reduced sensitivity against OP in various arthropods. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such reports are available for Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Hence, in the present study, we aimed to determine the association of AChE(s) gene(s) with resistance against OP. We screened the AChE genes (L. salmonis ace1a and ace1b) in two salmon lice populations: one sensitive (n=5) and the other resistant (n=5) for azamethiphos, a commonly used OP in salmon farming. The screening led to the identification of a missense mutation Phe362Tyr in L. salmonis ace1a, (corresponding to Phe331 in Torpedo californica AChE) in all the samples of the resistant population. We confirmed the potential role of the mutation, with reduced sensitivity against azamethiphos in L. salmonis, by screening for Phe362Tyr in 2 sensitive and 5 resistant strains. The significantly higher frequency of the mutant allele (362Tyr) in the resistant strains clearly indicated the possible association of Phe362Tyr mutation in L. salmonis ace1a with resistance towards azamethiphos. The 3D modelling, short term survival experiments and enzymatic assays further supported the imperative role of Phe362Tyr in reduced sensitivity of L. salmonis for azamethiphos. Based on all these observations, the present study, for the first time, presents the mechanism of resistance in L. salmonis against azamethiphos. In addition, we developed a rapid diagnostic tool for the high throughput screening of Phe362Tyr mutation using High Resolution Melt analysis.",0
"The study examined the density-mediated effects on growth, survival and dispersal of wild and farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar offspring in the period immediately following emergence, using a substitutive design. In small confined stream channels, wild parr coexisting with farmed parr had a significantly poorer survival, than wild parr alone. Density did not affect this relationship. In larger unconfined stream channels, wild parr coexisting with farmed parr entered a downstream trap in higher numbers than wild parr in allopatry. The results suggests that during the earliest life stages, farmed S. salar can outcompete wild S. salar, resulting in a reduced survival of wild S. salar.",1
"Non-lethal pathogen testing can be a useful tool for fish disease research and management. Our research objectives were to determine if (1) fin clips, gill snips, surface mucus scrapings, blood draws, or kidney biopsies could be obtained non-lethally from 3 to 15 g Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, (2) non-lethal samples could accurately discriminate between fish exposed to the bacterial kidney disease agent Renibacterium salmoninarum and non-exposed fish, and (3) non-lethal samples could serve as proxies for lethal kidney samples to assess infection intensity. Blood draws and kidney biopsies caused >/=5% post-sampling mortality (Objective 1) and may be appropriate only for larger fish, but the other sample types were non-lethal. Sampling was performed over 21 wk following R. salmoninarum immersion challenge of fish from 2 stocks (Objectives 2 and 3), and nested PCR (nPCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) results from candidate non-lethal samples were compared with kidney tissue analysis by nPCR, qPCR, bacteriological culture, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and histopathology/immunohistochemistry. R. salmoninarum was detected by PCR in >50% of fin, gill, and mucus samples from challenged fish. Mucus qPCR was the only non-lethal assay exhibiting both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity estimates>90% for distinguishing between R. salmoninarum-exposed and non-exposed fish and was the best candidate for use as an alternative to lethal kidney sample testing. Mucus qPCR R. salmoninarum quantity estimates reflected changes in kidney bacterial load estimates, as evidenced by significant positive correlations with kidney R. salmoninarum infection intensity scores at all sample times and in both fish stocks, and were not significantly impacted by environmental R. salmoninarum concentrations.",0
"The fallowing period is a management measure in aquaculture where the production is paused for a few months to reduce the impact on the benthic environment. We studied the effects of different fallowing periods on the recovery of macrofauna at two salmon farms in Norway. The macrofauna at the farm stations were characterised by high abundances of opportunistic taxa (e.g. Capitella spp.), low diversity and significantly different community structure compared to reference sites. The fallowing initiated macrofauna recovery at both farm stations, indicated by a decline of dominant opportunistic taxa after 2months. Significant changes in taxa composition occurred only after 6months, although indications of disturbance were still evident. Surprisingly, no corresponding spatial or temporal differences were found in the sediment parameters such as redox, TOC and pH. The results suggest that macrofauna is a more sensitive indicator and that the seasonal timing of fallowing may affect recovery dynamics.",0
"Phylogenetic analyses of the Salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV3) epizootic have suggested that a substitution from proline to serine in the receptor binding protein E2 position 206 has occurred after the introduction of virus from a wild reservoir to farmed salmonid fish in Norway. We modelled the 3D structure of P62, the uncleaved E3-E2 precursor, of SAVH20/03 based on its sequence homology to the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and studied in vitro and in vivo effects of the mutation using reverse genetics. E2(206) is located on the surface of the B-domain of E2, which is associated with receptor attachment in alphaviruses. Recombinant virus expressing the E2(206S) codon replicated slower and produced significantly less genomic copies than virus expressing the ancestral E2(206P) codon in vitro in Bluegill Fry (BF2) cells. The E2(206S) mutant was out-competed by the E2(206P) mutant after 5 passages in an in vitro competition assay, confirming that the substitution negatively affects the efficacy of virus multiplication in cell culture. Both mutants were highly infectious to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), produced similar viral RNA loads in gills, heart, kidney and brain, and induced similar histopathologic changes in these organs. The E2(206S) mutant produced a less persistent infection in salmon and was shed more rapidly to water than the E2(206P) mutant. Reduced generation time through more rapid shedding could therefore explain why a serine in this position became dominant in the viral population after SAV3 was introduced to farmed salmon from the wild reservoir.",0
"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a prevalent pathogen in fish worldwide. The virus causes substantial mortality in Atlantic salmon juveniles and smolts when transferred to sea water and persistent infection in surviving fish after disease outbreaks. Here, we have investigated the occurrence of the virus as well as the innate immune marker Mx in the head kidney (HK) of Atlantic salmon throughout an experimental challenge covering both a fresh and a seawater phase. The fish were challenged with a high (HV) and low virulence (LV) IPNV. Both isolates caused mortality due to reactivation of the virus after transfer to sea water. In the freshwater phase, higher levels of virus transcripts were detected in the HK of fish infected with LV IPNV compared to HV, suggesting that the HV isolate is able to limit its own replication to a level where the innate immune system is not alerted. Further, ex vivoHK leucocytes derived from fish infected with the two isolates were stimulated with CpG DNA. Significantly, higher IFN levels were found in the LV compared to the HV group in the freshwater phase. This suggests that the viruses attenuate the antiviral host immune response at different levels which may contribute to the observed differences in disease outcome.",0
"As the oceans absorb anthropogenic CO2 they become more acidic, a problem termed ocean acidification (OA). Since this increase in CO2 is occurring rapidly, OA may have profound implications for marine ecosystems. In the temperate northeast Pacific, fisheries play key economic and cultural roles and provide significant employment, especially in rural areas. In British Columbia (BC), sport (recreational) fishing generates more income than commercial fishing (including the expanding aquaculture industry). Salmon (fished recreationally and farmed) and Pacific Halibut are responsible for the majority of fishery-related income. This region naturally has relatively acidic (low pH) waters due to ocean circulation, and so may be particularly vulnerable to OA. We have analyzed available data to provide a current description of the marine ecosystem, focusing on vertical distributions of commercially harvested groups in BC in the context of local carbon and pH conditions. We then evaluated the potential impact of OA on this temperate marine system using currently available studies. Our results highlight significant knowledge gaps. Above trophic levels 2-3 (where most local fishery-income is generated), little is known about the direct impact of OA, and more importantly about the combined impact of multi-stressors, like temperature, that are also changing as our climate changes. There is evidence that OA may have indirect negative impacts on finfish through changes at lower trophic levels and in habitats. In particular, OA may lead to increased fish-killing algal blooms that can affect the lucrative salmon aquaculture industry. On the other hand, some species of locally farmed shellfish have been well-studied and exhibit significant negative direct impacts associated with OA, especially at the larval stage. We summarize the direct and indirect impacts of OA on all groups of marine organisms in this region and provide conclusions, ordered by immediacy and certainty.",0
"From 2009 to 2013, 80 oyster and 16 seawater samples were collected from the southern coast of Korea, including designated shellfish growing areas for export. The concentrations and bioaccumulation of heavy metals were determined, and a potential risk assessment was conducted to evaluate their hazards towards human consumption. The cadmium (Cd) concentration in oysters was the highest of three hazardous metals, including Cd, lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg), however, below the standards set by various countries. The metal bioaccumulation ratio in oysters was relatively high for zinc and Cd but low for Hg, Pb, arsenic, and chromium. The estimated dietary intakes of all heavy metals for oysters accounted for 0.02%-17.75% of provisional tolerable daily intake. The hazard index for all samples was far <1.0, which indicates that the oysters do not pose an appreciable hazard to humans for the metal pollutants of study.",0
"Amoebic Gill Disease affects farmed salmonids and is caused by Neoparamoeba perurans. Clonal cultures of this amoeba have been used for challenge experiments, however the effect of long-term culture on virulence has not been investigated. Here we show, using in vitro and in vivo methods, that a clone of N. perurans which was virulent 70 days after clonal culture lost virulence after 3 years in clonal culture. We propose that this is related either to the lack of attachment to the gills or the absence of an extracellular product, as shown by the lack of cytopathic effect on Chinook salmon embryo cells. The avirulent clonal culture of N. perurans allowed us to propose two potential virulence mechanisms/factors involved in Amoebic Gill Disease and is an invaluable tool for host-pathogen studies of Amoebic Gill Disease.",0
"This study examined methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in fish, the daily MeHg exposure dose, and the risk-benefit of MeHg, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega-3 PUFA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) related to fish intake among pregnant and infertile women in Taiwan. The measured MeHg concentrations in fish did not exceed the Codex guideline level of 1 mg/kg. Swordfish (0.28 +/- 0.23 mg/kg) and tuna (0.14 +/- 0.13 mg/kg) had the highest MeHg concentrations. The MeHg concentration in the hair of infertile women (1.82 +/- 0.14 mg/kg) was significantly greater than that of pregnant women (1.24 +/- 0.18 mg/kg). In addition, 80% of infertile women and 68% of pregnant women had MeHg concentrations in hair that exceeded the USEPA reference dose (1 mg/kg). The MeHg concentrations in hair were significantly and positively correlated with the estimated daily MeHg exposure dose. Based on the risk-benefit evaluation results, this paper recommends consumption of fish species with a low MeHg concentration and high concentrations of DHA + EPA and omega-3 PUFA (e.g., salmon, mackerel, and greater amberjack).",0
"Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is the causative agent of pancreas disease affecting Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout and causes a major burden to the aquaculture industry. This study describes a Norwegian subtype SAV3 virus isolate (SAV3-H10) subjected to serial passages in Chinook salmon embryo cells (CHSE-214) followed by Asian Grouper skin cells (AGK). Two passages from CHSE and one after transfer to AGK cells were chosen for further investigation, based on variation in degree and development of cytopathic effect (CPE). After plaque purification, several in vitro studies were performed. Cell viability after infection, viral replication and ability to cause morphological changes in CHSE and AGK cells was studied for the three isolates. The AGK-transferred isolate was identified with the strongest abilities to reduce cell viability, replicate more and cause more CPE in cell culture when compared with the early and late CHSE-grown isolates. Subsequently, the isolates were tested in an experimental fish challenge, showing higher viral load and higher pathological score for the least cell-cultured isolate. Full-length sequencing of the viral genome of the three isolates revealed divergence in four amino acid positions and the AGK-grown isolate also had a 3 nt deletion in the 3'UTR. In conclusion, we show that cell culture of SAV3-H10 selects for strains inducing earlier CPE in vitro with increased viral replication. In vivo, the effect is reversed, with lower replication levels and lower pathology scores in target organs. This study outlines a path to identify potential virulence motifs of SAV3.",0
"A pleomorphic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, indole-, oxidase- and catalase- negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacterium was originally isolated in 1992 from moribund, seawater farmed Atlantic salmon with multifocal tissue necrosis. Strain AVG 2115T displayed considerable similarities with Streptobacillus moniliformis, one of the two etiological agents of rat bite fever, and has been stored as Streptobacillus sp. NCIMB 703044T. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, this strain displayed >99 % sequence similarities with uncultured bacterial clones from the digestive tracts of marine mammals, followed by Sneathia sanguinegens CCUG 41628T (92.7 %), 'Sneathia amnii' Sn35 (92.5 %), Caviibacter abscessus CCUG 39713T (92.2 %), Streptobacillus ratti OGS16T (91.3 %), Streptobacillus notomytis AHL 370-1T (91.2 %), S. moniliformis DSM 12112T (91.0 %), Streptobacillus felis 131000547T (90.9 %) and Streptobacillus hongkongensis DSM 26322T (89.7 %). Sequence similarities to all other taxa were below 89 %. Phylogenetic analysis for strain NCIMB 703044T revealed highly similar results for gyrB, groEL and recA nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analyses independent of the employed treeing method. Average nucleotide identities (ANI) for complete genomes ranged from 66.00 % to 72.08 % between strain NCIMB 703044T and the type strains of Sebaldella termitidis, Leptotrichiabuccalis, Streptobacillus moniliformis, Sneathia sanguinegens and Caviibacter abscessus. Chemotaxonomic and physiological data of strain NCIMB 703044t were in congruence with closely related members of the family Leptotrichiaceae, represented by highly similar enzyme profiles and fatty acid patterns. MALDI-TOF MS analysis was capable to clearly discriminate strain NCIMB 703044T from all currently described taxa of the family Leptotrichiaceae. On the basis of these data we propose the novel taxon Oceanivirga salmonicida gen. nov. sp. nov. with the type strain AVG 2115T (=NCIMB 703044T) (=DSM 101867T). The G+C content is 25.4 %, genome size is 1.77 Mbp.",1
"Recent mass mortality outbreaks around the world in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, have seriously affected the aquaculture economy. Although the causes for these mortality outbreaks appear complex, infectious agents are involved. Two pathogens are associated with mass mortality outbreaks, the virus ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) and the bacterium Vibrio aestuarianus. Here we describe the interactions between these 2 pathogens and autophagy, a conserved intracellular pathway playing a key role in innate immunity. We show for the first time that autophagy pathway is present and functional in Pacific oysters and plays an important role to protect animals from infections. This study contributes to better understand the innate immune system of Pacific oysters.",0
"The freshwater trematode Nanophyetus salmincola has been demonstrated to impair salmonid immune function and resistance to the marine pathogen Vibrio anguillarum, potentially resulting in ocean mortality. We examined whether infection by the parasite N. salmincola similarly increases mortality of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha when they are exposed to the freshwater pathogens Flavobacterium columnare or Aeromonas salmonicida, two bacteria that juvenile salmonids might encounter during their migration to the marine environment. We used a two-part experimental design where juvenile Chinook Salmon were first infected with N. salmincola through cohabitation with infected freshwater snails, Juga spp., and then challenged with either F. columnare or A. salmonicida. Cumulative percent mortality from F. columnare infection was higher in N. salmincola-parasitized fish than in nonparasitized fish. In contrast, cumulative percent mortality from A. salmonicida infection did not differ between N. salmincola-parasitized and nonparasitized groups. No mortalities were observed in the N. salmincola-parasitized-only and control groups from either challenge. Our study demonstrates that a relatively high mean intensity (>200 metacercariae per posterior kidney) of encysted N. salmincola metacercariae can alter the outcomes of bacterial infection in juvenile Chinook Salmon, which might have implications for disease in wild fish populations.",1
"A commercial loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based system with bioluminescence, named as 3M Molecular Detection Assay (MDA), was validated for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes (3-strain cocktail) at low levels (100, 101, 102 CFU/100 cm2) inoculated on stainless steel (SS) and polyethylene (PE) surfaces, with and without (w/o) organic load (OL) of cold-smoked salmon homogenate by comparing with a standard ISO method as reference. The results of this study revealed that a commercial LAMP-based method performed equally effective compared with ISO method at inoculum levels of 100 and 102/100 cm2, showing 100% specificity and sensitivity, respectively. At 101 CFU/100 cm2, a slight reduction in the effectiveness of LAMP-based method was observed most likely due to the use of single enrichment step in the procedure of LAMP-based method. The LAMP-based method was shown to be rapid and reliable detection technique for L. monocytogenes present at low numbers on food processing surfaces, regardless of organic residues, and can be applicable in seafood industry.

"BACKGROUND: Gyrodactylus salaris is a monogenean, which has collapsed tens of wild Atlantic salmon populations. One of the means of preventing the spread of the parasite is the disinfection of the fishing equipment, which is used in the rivers having susceptible salmon populations. Little is known about the dosage of disinfectants against G. salaris. There are not standards for the testing of disinfectants against multicellular parasites. The present investigation developed a method to test disinfectants and examined the effectiveness of heated water and a commercially available disinfectant (Virkon S) in killing G. salaris. Individual G. salaris worms were followed under the microscope during treatment with heated water or Virkon S disinfectant blend. The logarithm of the time needed to kill the parasite was used as a dependent variable in linear regression. The upper 99.98 % prediction line for the dependent variable was used to obtain a value resembling the time needed for a 4 log reduction of the microbial pathogen, which is commonly used as a criterion for disinfectants. Also 6 log reduction was applied. RESULTS: Exposure to a relatively low temperature was found to kill the parasite. Even 5-50 min treatment (=10-100 times the 99.98 % upper prediction value) with heated water at 40 degrees C might be used. This would enable the utilisation of hot tap water in the disinfection of fishing gear. The present practice of 1 % Virkon S for 15 min was also found to kill the parasite. CONCLUSIONS: The follow-up of single parasites of a test population and the use of the calculated upper predictive line in the regression analysis offers a method to analyse the effects of disinfectants on parasites like G. salaris. The results of our tests give possibilities for using disinfection methods, which may be more acceptable by the fishermen than the present ones.",0
"Since the ban of malachite green in the fish farming industry, finding alternative ways of controlling Saprolegnia infections has become of utmost importance. Much effort has been made to elucidate the mechanisms by which Saprolegnia invades fish eggs. Little is known about the defence mechanisms of the hosts, making some eggs more prone to infection than others. One clue might lie in the composition of the eggs. As the immune system in the embryos is not developed yet, the difference in infection levels could be explained by factors influenced by the mother herself, by either transferring passive immunity, influencing the physical aspects of the eggs or both. One of the physical aspects that could be influenced by the female is the chorion, the extracellular coat surrounding the fish egg, which is in fact the first major barrier to be overcome by Saprolegnia spp. Our results suggest that a thicker chorion in eggs from Atlantic salmon gives a better protection against Saprolegnia spp. In addition to the identification of differences in sensitivity of eggs in a fish farm set-up, we were able to confirm these results in a laboratory-controlled challenge experiment.",0

"Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the typical toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are widely present in marine environment. BaP has diverse toxic effects, including teratogenic, carcinogenic, mutagenic effects and so on, in various organisms. In this work, we focused on the differential proteomic and metabolomic responses in the digestive gland of pearl oyster Pinctada martensii exposed to two doses of BaP (1 and 10mug/L). Metabolic responses revealed that the high dose of BaP (10mug/L) mainly caused disturbances in osmotic regulation and energy metabolism in the digestive gland. Proteomic responses indicated that both doses of BaP induced disturbances in energy metabolism, cytoskeleton, cell injury, oxidative stress and signal transduction based on the differential proteomic biomarkers. Overall, these results demonstrated a number of potential biomarkers that were characterized by an integrated proteomic and metabolomic approach and provided a useful insight into the toxicological effects on pearl oyster P. martensii.",0
"Viral hemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is an economically important disease that affects salmon and trout worldwide. In this study, a recombinant single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library derived from rainbow trout immunized with purified viral hemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was constructed. The library was subjected to three rounds of screening by flow cytometry (FCM) against VHSV through a bacteria display technology, resulting in the enrichment of scFv. Four scFv clones with different fluorescence intensity were obtained by colony pick up at random following three rounds of screening. The isolated scFv antibodies were expressed and purified. Relative affinity assay showed the four clones had different sensitivity to VHSV, in accordance with FCM. The potential use of the selected VHSV-specific scFv antibodies was demonstrated by the successful application in Western blotting assay, ELISA and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), and one of the isolated scFv molecular showed excellent in vitro and in vivo blocking activities against VHSV. scFv isolated in this study can be promising diagnostic and/or therapeutic reagents for VHS. This study provides powerful strategies for screening antibodies against new diseases.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Pyrodinium bahamense monitoring in water and their toxins in rock oyster Striostrea prismatica in Santiago Astata and Puerto Escondido Oaxaca was performed from September 2009 to July 2010. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pyrodinium bahamense abundance in water, and concentration and toxic profile of paralytic shellfish toxins were analyzed monthly in soft tissue of mollusk in composite samples in high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: High abundance of Pyrodinium bahamense was found in Santiago Astata on December, February, April and June; and in Puerto Escondido on April and June. The concentrations of the paralyzing toxin that exceeded the regulatory limit for human consumption of mollusks (800 microg STX eq. kg(-)(1)) were presented in Santiago Astata on November, December, January, February and June; and in Puerto Escondido on December and June. CONCLUSIONS: For several months there was risk to public health due to the presence of paralytic shellfish toxins above the regulatory limit in oysters from the study area.",0
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of the Maillard reaction on gelatin-based films (bovine and salmon) in the glassy state, in mixtures with low molecular weight plasticizers (e.g. glycerol, glucose and trehalose) at different storage times. For testing, the gelatin-plasticizer films were stored under glassy conditions (Tg-10 degrees C), previously determined by calorimetric tests. Studies under accelerated conditions (T >> Tg) were also developed. Color, opacity and browning index (Br) were evaluated by computer vision at all storage times. Results showed in samples stored under glassy conditions that the Maillard reaction did not occur, independent of gelatin origin and type of plasticizer. Changes in color stated by opacity and Br were only significant (p < 0.05) in gelatin-glucose systems under accelerated storage conditions. The inhibition of reaction in gelatin films in the glassy state was related to the well-known conditions of low molecular mobility of glassy matrices, but also with the non-Maillard reactive characteristics of glycerol and trehalose.",0
"Genetic transformation of fish is mainly oriented towards the improvement of growth for the benefit of the aquaculture. Actually, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is the species most transformed to achieve growth rates quite large compared to the wild. To anticipate the presence of contaminations with GM salmon in fish markets and the lack of labeling regulations with a mandatory threshold, the proper methods are needed to test the authenticity of the ingredients. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) method was used in this study. Ct values were obtained and validated using 15 processed food containing salmon. The relative and absolute limits of detection were 0.01% and 0.01 ng/mul of genomic DNA, respectively. Results demonstrate that the developed QRT-PCR method is suitable specifically for identification of S. salar in food ingredients based on the salmon growth hormone gene 1 (GH1). The processes used to develop the specific salmon reference gene case study are intended to serve as a model for performing quantification of Aquadvantage(R) GM salmon on future genetically modified (GM) fish to be commercialized.",0
"Algae are at the base of the aquatic food chain, producing the food resources that fish are adapted to consume. Previous studies have proven that the inclusion of small amounts (<10% of the diet) of algae in fish feed (aquafeed) resulted in positive effects in growth performance and feed utilisation efficiency. Marine algae have also been shown to possess functional activities, helping in the mediation of lipid metabolism, and therefore are increasingly studied in human and animal nutrition. The aim of this study was to assess the potentials of two commercially available algae derived products (dry algae meal), Verdemin (derived from Ulva ohnoi) and Rosamin (derived from diatom Entomoneis spp.) for their possible inclusion into diet of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar). Fish performances, feed efficiency, lipid metabolism and final product quality were assessed to investigated the potential of the two algae products (in isolation at two inclusion levels, 2.5% and 5%, or in combination), in experimental diets specifically formulated with low fish meal and fish oil content. The results indicate that inclusion of algae product Verdemin and Rosamin at level of 2.5 and 5.0% did not cause any major positive, nor negative, effect in Atlantic Salmon growth and feed efficiency. An increase in the omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LC-PUFA) content in whole body of fish fed 5% Rosamin was observed.",0
"A polyethyleneimine (PEI)-iron phosphate (FePO4) nanocomposite is prepared by immobilization of PEI onto the surface of FePO4 nanoparticles via electrostatic interaction. The obtained PEI-FePO4 nanocomposites are spherical with a size centered in ca. 100 nm. They provide a novel adsorbent for the solid-phase extraction of DNA from complex sample matrices. At pH 4, 50 mug mL(-1) of DNA (salmon sperm DNA sodium salt) in 1.0 mL aqueous solution are quantitatively adsorbed (100%) by 2mg of the PEI-FePO4 nanocomposites, and meanwhile the coexisting albumin at a same concentration level is not retained, demonstrating the favorable selectivity of the nanocomposites to DNA against proteins. The adsorption behaviors of DNA onto the PEI-FePO4 nanocomposites fit Langmuir model, corresponding to an adsorption capacity of 61.88 mg g(-1). The adsorbed DNA could be readily recovered by using a 0.04 mol L(-1) Britton-Robinson (BR) buffer at pH 10, resulting in a recovery of 85%. The nanocomposites have been further used for the isolation of DNA from a series of real sample matrices, including synthetic lambda-DNA sample, human whole blood and Escherichia coli cell lysate. The extraction efficiency and the purity of the recovered DNA are at least comparable to those achieved by using the reported sorbent materials or commercial kits. In addition, the DNAs isolated from human whole blood and E. coli cell lysate are of high quality, which have been further demonstrated by using them as templates for successful PCR amplifications.",0
"Most pathogen detection tests are imperfect, with a sensitivity < 100%, thereby resulting in the potential for a false negative, where a pathogen is present but not detected. False negatives in a sample inflate the number of non-detections, negatively biasing estimates of pathogen prevalence. Histological examination of tissues as a diagnostic test can be advantageous as multiple pathogens can be examined and providing important information on associated pathological changes to the host. However, it is usually less sensitive than molecular or microbiological tests for specific pathogens. Our study objectives were to 1) develop a hierarchical occupancy model to examine pathogen prevalence in spring Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and their distribution among host tissues 2) use the model to estimate pathogen-specific test sensitivities and infection rates, and 3) illustrate the effect of using replicate within host sampling on sample sizes required to detect a pathogen. We examined histological sections of replicate tissue samples from spring Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha collected after spawning for common pathogens seen in this population: Apophallus/echinostome metacercariae, Parvicapsula minibicornis, Nanophyetus salmincola/ metacercariae, and Renibacterium salmoninarum. A hierarchical occupancy model was developed to estimate pathogen and tissue-specific test sensitivities and unbiased estimation of host- and organ-level infection rates. Model estimated sensitivities and host- and organ-level infections rates varied among pathogens and model estimated infection rate was higher than prevalence unadjusted for test sensitivity, confirming that prevalence unadjusted for test sensitivity was negatively biased. The modeling approach provided an analytical approach for using hierarchically structured pathogen detection data from lower sensitivity diagnostic tests, such as histology, to obtain unbiased pathogen prevalence estimates with associated uncertainties. Accounting for test sensitivity using within host replicate samples also required fewer individual fish to be sampled. This approach is useful for evaluating pathogen or microbe community dynamics when test sensitivity is <100%.",0
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are two marine seafood-borne pathogens causing severe illnesses in humans and aquatic animals. In this study, a recently developed novel multiple endonuclease restriction real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification technology (MERT-LAMP) were successfully developed and evaluated for simultaneous detection of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus strains in only a single reaction. Two MERT-LAMP primer sets were designed to specifically target toxR gene of V. parahaemolyticus and rpoS gene of V. vulnificus. The MERT-LAMP reactions were conducted at 62 degrees C, and the positive results were produced in as short as 19 min with the genomic DNA templates extracted from the V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus strains. The two target pathogens present in the same sample could be simultaneously detected and correctly differentiated based on distinct fluorescence curves in a real-time format. The sensitivity of MERT-LAMP assay was 250 fg and 125 fg DNA per reaction with genomic templates of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus strains, which was in conformity with conventional LAMP detection. Compared with PCR-based techniques, the MERT-LAMP technology was 100- and 10-fold more sensitive than that of PCR and qPCR methods. Moreover, the limit of detection of MERT-LAMP approach for V. parahaemolyticus isolates and V. vulnificus isolates detection in artificially-contaminated oyster samples was 92 CFU and 83 CFU per reaction. In conclusion, the MERT-LAMP assay presented here was a rapid, specific, and sensitive tool for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus, and could be adopted for simultaneous screening of V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus in a wide variety of samples.",0
"Salmons raised in aquaculture farms around the world are increasingly subjected to sub-optimal environmental conditions, such as high water temperatures during summer seasons. Aerobic scope increases and lipid metabolism changes are known plasticity responses of fish for a better acclimation to high water temperature. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of high water temperature on the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in juvenile Atlantic salmon fed different dietary ARA/EPA ratios (arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6/ eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3), with particular focus on apparent in vivo enzyme activities and gene expression of lipid metabolism pathways. Three experimental diets were formulated to be identical, except for the ratio EPA/ARA, and fed to triplicate groups of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) kept either at 10 degrees C or 20 degrees C. Results showed that fatty acid metabolic utilisation, and likely also their dietary requirements for optimal performance, can be affected by changes in their relative levels and by environmental temperature in Atlantic salmon. Thus, the increase in temperature, independently from dietary treatment, had a significant effect on the beta-oxidation of a fatty acid including EPA, as observed by the apparent in vivo enzyme activity and mRNA expression of pparalpha -transcription factor in lipid metabolism, including beta-oxidation genes- and cpt1 -key enzyme responsible for the movement of LC-PUFA from the cytosol into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation-, were both increased at the higher water temperature. An interesting interaction was observed in the transcription and in vivo enzyme activity of Delta5fad-time-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of EPA and ARA. Such, at lower temperature, the highest mRNA expression and enzyme activity was recorded in fish with limited supply of dietary EPA, whereas at higher temperature these were recorded in fish with limited ARA supply. In consideration that fish at higher water temperature recorded a significantly increased feed intake, these results clearly suggested that at high, sub-optimal water temperature, fish metabolism attempted to increment its overall ARA status -the most bioactive LC-PUFA participating in the inflammatory response- by modulating the metabolic fate of dietary ARA (expressed as % of net intake), reducing its beta-oxidation and favouring synthesis and deposition. This correlates also with results from other recent studies showing that both immune- and stress- responses in fish are up regulated in fish held at high temperatures. This is a novel and fundamental information that warrants industry and scientific attention, in consideration of the imminent increase in water temperatures, continuous expansion of aquaculture operations, resources utilisation in aquafeed and much needed seasonal/adaptive nutritional strategies.",0
"Here, we address the morphological changes of eyed eggs of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. infected with Saprolegnia from a commercial hatchery and after experimental infection. Eyed eggs infected with Saprolegnia spp. from 10 Atlantic salmon females were obtained. Egg pathology was investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy. Eggs from six of ten females were infected with S. parasitica, and two females had infections with S. diclina clade IIIA; two Saprolegnia isolates remained unidentified. Light microscopy showed S. diclina infection resulted in the chorion in some areas being completely destroyed, whereas eggs infected with S. parasitica had an apparently intact chorion with hyphae growing within or beneath the chorion. The same contrasting pathology was found in experimentally infected eggs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that S. parasitica grew on the egg surface and hyphae were found penetrating the chorion of the egg, and re-emerging on the surface away from the infection site. The two Saprolegnia species employ different infection strategies when colonizing salmon eggs. Saprolegnia diclina infection results in chorion destruction, while S. parasitica penetrates intact chorion. We discuss the possibility these infection mechanisms representing a necrotrophic (S. diclina) vs. a facultative biotrophic strategy (S. parasitica).",0
"Changes in normal chromosome numbers (i.e. aneuploidy) due to abnormal chromosome segregation may arise either spontaneously or as a result of chemical/radiation exposure, particularly during cell division. Coastal ecosystems are continuously subjected to various contaminants originating from urban, industrial and agricultural activities. Genotoxicity is common to several families of major environmental pollutants, including pesticides, which therefore represent a potential important environmental hazard for marine organisms. A previous study demonstrated the vertical transmission of DNA damage by subjecting oyster genitors to short-term exposure to the herbicide diuron at environmental concentrations during gametogenesis. In this paper, Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to further characterize diuron-induced DNA damage at the chromosomal level. rDNA genes (5S and 18-5.8-28S), previously mapped onto Crassostrea gigas chromosomes 4, 5 and 10, were used as probes on the interphase nuclei of embryo preparations. Our results conclusively show higher aneuploidy (hypo- or hyperdiploidy) level in embryos from diuron-exposed genitors, with damage to the three studied chromosomal regions. This study suggests that sexually developing oysters are vulnerable to diuron exposure, incurring a negative impact on reproductive success and oyster recruitment.",1
"The mangrove oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae is an estuarine resource exploited by riverside communities in Northeast Brazil. Despite its socioeconomic importance, studies on the health status of this bivalve are scanty in this region. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence of the protozoan Perkinsus sp. in C. rhizophorae collected in August and September 2011 in three estuaries of the septentrional Northeast, Brazil: Jaguaribe (Ceara), Camurupim (Piaui) and Carnaubeiras (Maranhao) (n= 150 specimens/site). The samples were submitted to Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM), PCR and histology assays. The RFTM assay revealed spherical, blue or bluish-black hypnospores of the genus Perkinsus in 50 specimens (Jaguaribe= 17.3%, Camurupim= 5.3%, Carnaubeiras= 10.6%). The intensity of the infection ranged from very light (1-10 cells per slide) to severe (more than 40 cells in each of 10 fields of the slide) for Jaguaribe; very light for Camurupim and very light to moderate (at least 40 cells observed in each of 10 fields of the slide) for Carnaubeiras. When submitted to confirmatory PCR analysis, 6 cases were confirmed (Jaguaribe=3, Camurupim=1, Carnaubeiras=2). The histology confirmed 21 cases of infection in specimens from the three estuaries. Although local collectors have reported no mortality in oyster populations that might be attributed to infection by Perkinsus, health surveillance of oyster populations in the septentrional region of Northeast Brazil is advisable.",0
"BACKGROUND: Farwa is an Island in Libya receives petrochemical wastes generated from General Company of Chemical Industries (GCCI) since more than 40 years. AIM: The present work aimed to determine the concentrations of mercury (Hg(+2)) in fish, marine plants and sediment collected from Farwa lagoon to evaluate effect of industrial wastewater from GCCI on the marine environment. METHODS: Hundred and twelve samples of fish, pearl oyster, cuttlefish sediments and marine plants were analyzed to determine Hg(2+) concentration during the period from January to August 2014 by using Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS). RESULTS: The highest concentration of Hg(2+) was detected in Pinctada radiata (11.67 +/- 3.30 mugg (-1)) followed by Serranus scriba (6.37 +/- 0.11 mug g (-1)) and Epinephelus marginatus (6.19 +/- 0.02 mug g (-1)). About 75 % of marine plants contained the maximum contaminations during the summer season. In fish samples Hg(2+) concentrations exceeded the levels provided by international standards. CONCLUSIONS: The fish at Farwa lagoon is heavily contaminated with Hg(2+) which may represent a source for mercury poisoning for human.",0
"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is the main oyster species produced in the world, and a key coastal economic resource in France. High mortalities affect Pacific oysters since 2008 in France and Europe. Their origins have been attributed to a combination of biotic and abiotic factors, underlining the importance of environment quality. The impact of water pollution has been pointed out and one of the pollutants, the genotoxic herbicide diuron, occurs at high concentrations all along the French coasts. Previous work has revealed that a parental exposure to diuron had a strong impact on hatching rates and offspring development even if spats were not exposed to diuron themselves. In this study, we explored for the first time the transcriptional changes occurring in oyster spats (non exposed) originating from genitors exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of diuron during gametogenesis using the RNAseq methodology. We identified a transcriptomic remodeling revealing an effect of the herbicide. Different molecular pathways involved in energy production, translation and cell proliferation are particularly disturbed. This analysis revealed modulated candidate genes putatively involved in response to oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in offspring of genitors exposed to diuron. Complementary measures of the activity of enzymes involved in these latter processes corroborate the results obtained at the transcriptomic level. In addition, our results suggested an increase in energy production and mitotic activity in 5-month-spats from diuron-exposed genitors. These results could correspond to a ""catch-up growth"" phenomenon allowing the spats from diuron-exposed genitors, which displayed a growth delay at 3 months, to gain a normal size when they reach the age of 6 months. These results indicate that exposure to a concentration of diuron that is frequently encountered in the field during the oyster's gametogenesis stage can impact the next generation and may result in fitness disturbance.",0
"Despite evidence for participation in the host response to infection, the roles of many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remain unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify lncRNAs in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and evaluate their transcriptomic regulation during ISA virus (ISAV) infection, an Orthomyxoviridae virus associated with high mortalities in salmonid aquaculture. Using next-generation sequencing, whole-transcriptome analysis of the Salmo salar response to ISAV infection was performed, identifying 5,636 putative lncRNAs with a mean length of 695 base pairs. The transcriptional modulation evidenced a similar number of differentially expressed lncRNAs in the gills (3,294), head-kidney (3,275), and liver (3,325) over the course of the infection. Moreover, analysis of a subset of these lncRNAs showed the following: (i) Most were similarly regulated in response to ISA virus infection; (ii) The transcript subsets were uniquely modulated in each tissue (gills, liver, and head-kidney); and (iii) A subset of lncRNAs were upregulated for each tissue and time analysed, indicating potential markers for ISAV infection. These findings represent the first discovery of widespread differential expression of lncRNAs in response to virus infection in non-model species, suggesting that lncRNAs could be involved in regulating the host response during ISAV infection.",0
"BACKGROUND: The use of phytochemicals is a promising solution in biological control against salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). Glucosinolates belong to a diverse group of compounds used as protection against herbivores by plants in the family Brassicaceae, while in vertebrates, ingested glucosinolates exert health-promoting effects due to their antioxidant and detoxifying properties as well as effects on cell proliferation and growth. The aim of this study was to investigate if Atlantic salmon fed two different doses of glucosinolate-enriched feeds would be protected against lice infection. The effects of feeding high dose of glucosinolates before the infection, and of high and low doses five weeks into the infection were studied. METHODS: Skin was screened by 15 k oligonucleotide microarray and qPCR. RESULTS: A 25 % reduction (P < 0.05) in lice counts was obtained in the low dose group and a 17 % reduction in the high dose group compared to fish fed control feed. Microarray analysis revealed induction of over 50 interferon (IFN)-related genes prior to lice infection. Genes upregulated five weeks into the infection in glucosinolate-enriched dietary groups included Type 1 pro-inflammatory factors, antimicrobial and acute phase proteins, extracellular matrix remodeling proteases and iron homeostasis regulators. In contrast, genes involved in muscle contraction, lipid and glucose metabolism were found more highly expressed in the skin of infected control fish. CONCLUSIONS: Atlantic salmon fed glucosinolates had a significantly lower number of sea lice at the end of the experimental challenge. Feeding glucosinolates coincided with increased expression of IFN-related genes, and higher expression profiles of Type 1 immune genes late into the infection. In addition, regulation of genes involved in the metabolism of iron, lipid and sugar suggested an interplay between metabolism of nutrients and mechanisms of resistance.",0
"Invasive planktonic crustaceans have become a prominent feature of aquatic communities worldwide, yet their effects on food webs are not well known. The Asian calanoid copepod, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, introduced to the Columbia River Estuary approximately 15 years ago, now dominates the late-summer zooplankton community, but its use by native aquatic predators is unknown. We investigated whether three species of planktivorous fishes (chinook salmon, three-spined stickleback, and northern pikeminnow) and one species of mysid exhibited higher feeding rates on native copepods and cladocerans relative to P. forbesi by conducting `single-prey' feeding experiments and, additionally, examined selectivity for prey types with `two-prey' feeding experiments. In single-prey experiments individual predator species showed no difference in feeding rates on native cyclopoid copepods (Cyclopidae spp.) relative to invasive P. forbesi, though wild-collected predators exhibited higher feeding rates on cyclopoids when considered in aggregate. In two-prey experiments, chinook salmon and northern pikeminnow both strongly selected native cladocerans (Daphnia retrocurva) over P. forbesi, and moreover, northern pikeminnow selected native Cyclopidae spp. over P. forbesi. On the other hand, in two-prey experiments, chinook salmon, three-spined stickleback and mysids were non- selective with respect to feeding on native cyclopoid copepods versus P. forbesi. Our results indicate that all four native predators in the Columbia River Estuary can consume the invasive copepod, P. forbesi, but that some predators select for native zooplankton over P. forbesi, most likely due to one (or both) of two possible underlying casual mechanisms: 1) differential taxon-specific prey motility and escape responses (calanoids > cyclopoids > daphnids) or 2) the invasive status of the zooplankton prey resulting in naivety, and thus lower feeding rates, of native predators feeding on invasive prey.",0
"This study identifies four new IL-17A/F isoforms in salmonids, as well as IL-17N. IL-17A/F1 and IL-17A/F2 are each represented by two paralogues, with a predicted pseudogene of IL-17N also apparent in the salmonid genome. Analysis of the sequences and genes of the known IL-17A/F and IL-17N molecules suggests that IL-17N is a member within the IL-17A/F subfamily. Analysis of factors that modulated the expression of these genes showed that PHA and PMA were good inducers of salmon IL-17A/F1a and IL-17A/F2a, with rIL-21 a potent stimulator of IL-17A/F1a and IL-17A/F3. The potential involvement of these isoforms during responses post-vaccination and infection was also studied. In unvaccinated control fish, Yersinia ruckeri infection resulted in a marked up-regulation of IL-17A/F1a and IL-17N in the spleen and head kidney and IL-17A/F2a and IL-17A/F3 in the spleen. In the vaccinated fish, only one significant increase was seen relative to control fish, of IL-17A/F2a in the gills, whether the fish were challenged with Y. ruckeri or given the saline placebo. It was also apparent in the gills and head kidney that the level of IL-17A/F1b remained elevated in the Y. ruckeri-challenged fish at a time when it had decreased in saline-injected fish. The relative importance of these isoforms for disease resistance remains to be determined.",0
"Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is a widespread disease of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and is associated with piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) infection. PRV is detectable in blood long before development of pathology in cardiac- and skeletal muscle appear, and erythrocytes have been identified as important target cells for the virus. The effects of PRV infection on cellular processes of erythrocytes are not known, but haemolytic anemia or systemic lysis of erythrocytes does not seem to occur, even with high virus loads in erythrocytes. In this study, gene expression profiling performed with high-density oligonucleotide microarray showed that PRV infection of erythrocytes induced a large panel of virus responsive genes. These involved interferon-regulated antiviral genes, as well as genes involved in antigen presentation via MHC class I. PRV infection also stimulated negative immune regulators. In contrast, a large number of immune genes expressed prior to infection were down-regulated. Moderate reduction of expression was also found for many genes encoding components of cytoskeleton and myofiber, proteins involved in metabolism, ion exchange, cell-cell interactions as well as growth factors and regulators of differentiation. PRV did not affect expression of genes involved in heme biosynthesis, gas exchange or erythrocyte-specific markers, but some regulators of erythropoiesis showed decreased transcription levels. These results indicate that PRV infection activates innate antiviral immunity in salmon erythrocytes, but suppresses other gene expression programs. Gene expression profiles suggest major phenotypic changes in PRV infected erythrocytes, but the functional consequences remain to be explored.",0
"The release of untreated sanitary sewage, combined with unplanned urban growth, are major factors contributing to degradation of coastal ecosystems in developing countries, including Brazil. Sanitary sewage is a complex mixture of chemicals that can negatively affect aquatic organisms. The use of molecular biomarkers can help to understand and to monitor the biological effects elicited by contaminants. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in transcript levels of genes related to xenobiotic biotransformation in the gills of oysters Crassostrea brasiliana transplanted and kept for 24h at three areas potentially contaminated by sanitary sewage (Bucheller river, BUC; Biguacu river, BIG; and Ratones island, RAT), one farming area (Sambaqui beach, SAM) and at one reference site (Forte beach, FOR) in the North Bay of Santa Catarina Island (Florianopolis, Brazil). Transcript levels of four cytochrome P450 isoforms (CYP2AU1, CYP3A-like, CYP356A1-like and CYP20A1-like), three glutathione S-transferase (GST alpha-like, GST pi-like and GST microsomal 3-like) and one sulfotransferase gene (SULT-like) were evaluated by means of quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Chemical analysis of the sediment from each site were performed and revealed the presence of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, linear alkylbenzenes and fecal sterols in the contaminated areas (BUC and BIG). Water quality analysis showed that these sites had the highest levels of fecal coliforms and other parameters evidencing the presence of urban sewage discharges. Among the results for gene transcription, CYP2AU1 and SULT-like levels were upregulated by 20 and 50-fold, respectively, in the oysters kept for 24h at the most contaminated site (BUC), suggesting a role of these genes in the detoxification of organic pollutants. These data reinforce that gills possibly have an important role in xenobiotic metabolism and highlight the use of C. brasiliana as a sentinel for monitoring environmental contamination in coastal regions.",0
"Aquaculture production has nearly tripled in the last two decades, bringing with it a significant increase in the use of antibiotics. Using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the presence of 47 antibiotics was investigated in U.S. purchased shrimp, salmon, catfish, trout, tilapia, and swai originating from 11 different countries. All samples (n=27) complied with U.S. FDA regulations and five antibiotics were detected above the limits of detection: oxytetracycline (in wild shrimp, 7.7ng/g of fresh weight; farmed tilapia, 2.7; farmed salmon, 8.6; farmed trout with spinal deformities, 3.9), 4-epioxytetracycline (farmed salmon, 4.1), sulfadimethoxine (farmed shrimp, 0.3), ormetoprim (farmed salmon, 0.5), and virginiamycin (farmed salmon marketed as antibiotic-free, 5.2). A literature review showed that sub-regulatory levels of antibiotics, as found here, can promote resistance development; publications linking aquaculture to this have increased more than 8-fold from 1991 to 2013. Although this study was limited in size and employed sample pooling, it represents the largest reconnaissance of antibiotics in U.S. seafood to date, providing data on previously unmonitored antibiotics and on farmed trout with spinal deformities. Results indicate low levels of antibiotic residues and general compliance with U.S. regulations. The potential for development of microbial drug resistance was identified as a key concern and research priority.",0
"In the current study, we tested the effects of common environmental contaminants (the metals zinc and lead) on gene expression in Sydney rock oysters (Saccrostrea glomerata). Oysters were exposed to a range of metal concentrations under controlled laboratory conditions. The expression of 14 putative stress response genes was then measured using quantitative, real-time (q) PCR. The expression of all 14 genes was significantly affected (p < 0.05 vs. nonexposed controls) by at least one of the metals, and by at least one dose of metal. For 5 of the 14 target genes (actin, calmodulin, superoxide dismutase, topoisomerase I, and tubulin) the alteration of expression relative to controls was highest at intermediate (rather than high) doses of metals. Such responses may reflect adaptive (acclimation) reactions in gene expression at low to intermediate doses of contaminants, followed by a decline in expression resulting from exposure at higher doses. The data are discussed in terms of the intracellular pathways affected by metal contamination, and the relevance of such gene expression data to environmental biomonitoring.",0
"Following the ban of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs) flame retardants under well-documented toxicity issues, organophosphate such as tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) and tris(2-cloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) were considered as potential substitutes. Although TBOEP and TCEP are consistently detected in the aquatic environment, there are few data about the possible toxicological effects of these compounds on aquatic organisms, including fish. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of TBOEP and TCEP on neuro- and interrenal steroidogenesis of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), after a seven-day exposure to four different concentrations (0 (control), 0.04, 0.2 and 1mg/L) of each compound. TBOEP and TCEP were diluted in Milli-Q water. The expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis (StAR, cyp19a, cyp19b, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-hsd), and 11beta-hydroxylase (cyp11beta)), were analyzed in the brain and head kidney using real-time PCR. Plasma 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) analysis was performed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Our results showed that TBOEP accumulated more rapidly than TCEP in fish muscle tissue. Surprisingly, TBOEP produced less pronounced effects than TCEP on neural and interrenal steroidogenic responses, despite the observed rapid uptake and bioaccumulation pattern. Specifically, TBOEP produced significant and consistent concentration-specific alterations on neural- and interrenal steroidogenesis. Plasma levels of 11-KT were not significantly altered by any of the exposures. The increased expression of steroidogenic genes demonstrated in the present study could produce time-specific alterations in the production of glucocorticoids and steroid hormones that play integral roles in fish metabolism, stress responses and adaptation, sexual maturation, reproduction and migration with overt consequences on reproductive success and survival.",0
"This work describes orthogonal NMR and MS tests for the structure and composition of the drug protamine sulfate derived from chum salmon. The spectral response pattern obtained by 1D-(1)H-NMR and MS methods from salmon protamine, a mixture of four predominant peptide chains, is dependent on the amino acid sequence and abundance of each peptide. Thus, an assay was developed based on the ratios of alanine, glycine and arginine amino acid residue NMR peaks (relative to the arginine CdeltaH proton signal) in this mixture that are unique to the salmon source. In addition, MS analysis provided sensitive sequence determination and impurity analysis based on shifts from exact masses. Spectra from protamine sulfate active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) suppliers and from a formulated drug product purchased from the US market were examined. Based on these marketplace survey data, NMR acceptance criteria for chum salmon derived protamine sulfate could be based on the absence of aromatic amino acid signals and on ratios of Ala betaH/Arg deltaH, Gly alphaH/Arg deltaH and Arg alphaH/Arg deltaH integrated areas of 2.4 +/- 1%, 9.4 +/- 3% and 50 +/- 5%, respectively. For MS, acceptance criteria based on the presence of specific mass to charge (m/z) ratio peaks (m/z = +8 of 530.455, 540.841, 532.208 and 508.950) could be used for the four major peptides present in the mixture with relative abundances of 17 +/- 1%, 31 +/- 2%, 27 +/- 1% and 25 +/- 3%, respectively. The specificity of the combined NMR and MS assay was tested by comparison to data obtained from herring protamine which contains a different mixture of peptides with related amino acid sequences. Both assays were able to clearly distinguish protamine derived from these different natural sources.",0
"Enzyme activities and gene expression of a number of innate immune parameters in the serum, mucus and skin of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were investigated after challenge with a pathogenic strain of Aeromonas salmonicida (A. salmonicida). Fish were injected in the dorsal muscle with either 100 mul bacterium solution, about 3.05 x 10(7) CFU/ml A. salmonicida, or 100 mul 0.9% NaCl (as control group) and tissue samples were collected at days 0, 2, 4 and 6 post-injection. Lysozyme (LSZ) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities in serum, mucus and skin, and LSZ and AKP mRNA expression in skin of the challenged fish were higher than those of the control at most of the experimental time, with significant differences at several time points (P < 0.05), indicating the involvement of LSZ and AKP in the innate immunity of Atlantic salmon to A. salmonicida. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities in mucus and skin, along with the SOD, POD and CAT mRNA expression in skin significantly decreased at day 4 and 6, indicating the decreased antioxidant capacity of the challenged fish. Glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) activities in serum, mucus and skin of the challenged group were all higher than those of the control after the injection, and at several time points significant differences were found between the two groups, suggesting organs of fish were impaired after the pathogen infection. The changes of the GPT and GOT activities could be used as potential biomarkers for the impairment of physiological functions caused by the pathogen infection. Identified biomarkers of the immune responses will contribute to the early-warning system of the disease. So this study will not only provide a theoretical basis for vaccine development, but also provide basic data for the establishment of early warning systems for diseases caused by A. salmonicida in Atlantic salmon rearing.",0
"BACKGROUND: The probiotic bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens strain S4Sm, isolated from the inner shell surface of a healthy oyster, secretes the antibiotic tropodithietic acid (TDA), is an excellent biofilm former, and increases oyster larvae survival when challenged with bacterial pathogens. In this study, we investigated the specific roles of TDA secretion and biofilm formation in the probiotic activity of S4Sm. RESULTS: Mutations in clpX (ATP-dependent ATPase) and exoP (an exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene) were created by insertional mutagenesis using homologous recombination. Mutation of clpX resulted in the loss of TDA production, no decline in biofilm formation, and loss of the ability to inhibit the growth of Vibrio tubiashii and Vibrio anguillarum in co-colonization experiments. Mutation of exoP resulted in a ~60% decline in biofilm formation, no decline in TDA production, and delayed inhibitory activity towards Vibrio pathogens in co-colonization experiments. Both clpX and exoP mutants exhibited reduced ability to protect oyster larvae from death when challenged by Vibrio tubiashii. Complementation of the clpX and exoP mutations restored the wild type phenotype. We also found that pre-colonization of surfaces by S4Sm was critical for this bacterium to inhibit pathogen colonization and growth. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations demonstrate that probiotic activity by P. inhibens S4Sm involves contributions from both biofilm formation and the production of the antibiotic TDA. Further, probiotic activity also requires colonization of surfaces by S4Sm prior to the introduction of the pathogen.",0
"Acquiring antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria through consuming contaminated animal food products is an emerging public health concern, though the sources of contamination are not always clear. This study characterized the occurrence of AMR in Escherichia coli from bivalve molluscs and assessed for the possible sources in the Hillsborough river complex of Prince Edward Island, Canada in areas overlapping with an oyster fishery. Multivariable statistical analysis indicated that the probability of detecting E. coli increased as the estimated dosage of animal effluent contamination decreased. Isolates with AMR were only found from sampling sites closest to untreated human effluent sources. Twenty-seven percent (n=6 of 22) of the isolates were pathogenic, with virulence factors consistent with extraintestinal E. coli of human origin. Though there is more evidence of contamination arising from human effluent, more research is needed to identify driving sources.",1
"Microbiological evaluation is one of the most important parameters for analyzing the viability of an oyster farming system, which addresses public health and ecological concerns. Here, the microbiological quality of the oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae cultivated in a monitored environment and from natural beds in Bahia, northeastern Brazil, was determined. Bacterial diversity in oysters was measured by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Sequence analysis revealed that most bacterial species showed similarity with uncultured or unidentified bacteria from environmental samples, and were clustered into the phylum Proteobacteria. Diverse bacteria from cultivated (monitored) oyster samples were grouped in the same cluster with a high similarity index (above 79%). Microbiological analyses revealed that these oysters did not contain pathogens. These results reflect the natural balance of the microbial communities essential to the maintenance of health and in inhibiting pathogen colonization in the oyster. On the other hand, bacterial diversity of samples from native stocks in extractive areas displayed a similarity index varying between 55 and 77%, and all samples were clustered separately from each other and from the cluster of samples derived from the cultivation area. Microbiological analyses showed that oysters from the extractive area were not fit for human consumption. This reflected a different composition of the microbial community in this area, probably resulting from anthropic impact. Our study also demonstrated that low temperatures and high rainfall limits the bacterial concentration in tropical oysters. This is the first study analyzing the total bacterial community profiles of the oyster C. rhizophorae.",0
"The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is the most important commercial oyster species cultivated in the world. Meanwhile, the ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) is one of the major pathogens affecting the Pacific oyster, and numerous mortality outbreaks related to this pathogen are now reported worldwide. To assess the genetic basis of resistance to OsHV-1 infection in spat C. gigas and to facilitate breeding programs for such a trait, if any exist, we compared the mortality of half- and full-sib families using three field methods and a controlled challenge by OsHV-1 in the laboratory. In the field, three methods were tested: (A) one family per bag; (B) one family per small soft mesh bag and all families inside one bag; (C) same as the previous methods but the oysters were individually labelled and then mixed. The mean mortality ranged from 80 to 82% and was related to OsHV-1 based on viral DNA detection. The narrow-sense heritability for mortality, and thus OsHV-1 resistance, ranged from 0.49 to 0.60. The high positive genetic correlations across the field methods suggested no genotype by environment interaction. Ideally, selective breeding could use method B, which is less time- and space-consuming. The narrow sense heritability for mortality under OsHV-1 challenge was 0.61, and genetic correlation between the field and the laboratory was ranged from 0.68 to 0.75, suggesting a weak genotype by environment interaction. Thus, most of families showing the highest survival performed well in field and laboratory conditions, and a similar trend was also observed for families with the lowest survival. In conclusion, this is the first study demonstrating a large additive genetic variation for resistance to OsHV-1 infection in C. gigas, regardless of the methods used, which should help in selective breeding to improve resistance to viral infection in C. gigas.",0
"PCBs were analyzed in two species of oyster (Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea edulis) cultured in intertidal beds and rafts coming from the Galician Rias during the period 2011-2014. PCBs were also analyzed in mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected in the same Rias during 2011. The main objective of this work is to investigate the distribution of PCBs in Galician oysters and to study their suitability as bioindicator in comparison to mussels. The levels of SigmaPCBs (ten congeners) ranged from 5.58 to 179.49 ng g(-1) d.w. The effect of biological parameters (shell length, lipid content and condition index) on bioaccumulation of PCBs was also evaluated. ANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between species for higher chlorinated biphenyls (CBs 153 and 138). The spatial patterns were investigated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed differences between geographical areas (Rias Altas, Centrales and Baixas) in the distribution of PCBs.",0
"Area management, the coordination of production and biosecurity practices across neighboring farms, is an important disease control strategy in aquaculture. Area management in aquaculture escalated in prominence in response to outbreaks of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) internationally. Successes in disease control have been attributed to the separation achieved through area-level synchronized stocking, fallowing, movement restrictions, and fomite or pest control. Area management, however, is costly; often demanding extra biosecurity, lengthy or inconveniently timed fallows, and localization of equipment, personnel, and services. Yet, this higher-order organizational structure has received limited epidemiologic attention. Chile's National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service instigated area management practices in response to the 2007 emergence of ISA virus (ISAV). Longitudinal data simultaneously collected allowed retrospective evaluation of the impact of component tenets on virus control. Spatiotemporal analyses identified hydrographic linkages, shared ports, and fish transfers from areas with recent occurrence of ISAV as the strongest predictors of virus spread between areas, though specifics varied by ISAV type (here categorized as HPR0 for the non-virulent genotypes, and HPRv otherwise). Hydrographic linkages were most predictive in the period before implementation of enhanced biosecurity and fallowing regulations, suggesting that viral load can impact spread dynamics. HPR0 arose late in the study period, so few HPRv events were available by which to explore the hypothesis of HPR0 as progenitor of outbreaks. However, spatiotemporal patterns in HPRv occurrence were predictive of subsequent patterns in HPR0 detection, suggesting a parallel, or dependent, means of spread. Better data precision, breadth and consistency, common challenges for retrospective studies, could improve model fit; and, for HPR0, specification of diagnostic test accuracy would improve interpretation.",0
"In order to predict the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in raw fish fillets, salmon slices, tuna slices and tilapia slices were disinfected by cold sterilization, inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes, transferred for storage at 4, 8, 15, 25 and 35 √ÅC, and then counted at appropriate time intervals. Five common primary models (Gompertz, Baranyi, Logistic, Richards and MMF) were applied to fit the growth curve for Listeria monocytogenes. The correlation coefficient (R2) and standard deviation (MSE) were compared to identify Gompertz model as the best fitting model. Extended square-root models concerning growth kinetic parameters (maximum specific growth rate and lag period) of Listeria monocytogenes as a function of temperature, pH, water activity (aw) and were developed. The R2, bias value (Bf) and accuracy (Af) were calculated to evaluate the established models. The results showed that the secondary models could describe the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in raw fish fillets with satisfaction.",0
"Listeria monocytogenes results in potential food safety concerns in ready-to-eat refrigerated products. Cold-smoked salmon is a food considered to be at high risk for Listeria spp. contamination for which a mild heat treatment or pasteurization step might be helpful to reduce microbial levels. Cold-smoked salmon was inoculated with a cocktail of four strains (L. monocytogenes: ATCC19114, 7644, and 19113, and L. innocua: ATCC51742) and inactivation curves obtained at 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66√ÅC using capillary tube methods. Inactivation results showed typical log linear trends (R2 _ 0.97). D-values of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua were 0.3 to 14.1 min at 66 to 58√ÅC, with a z-value of 5.2 to 6.5√ÅC and activation energy of 332 to 414 kJ/mol. The nonpathogenic Listeria innocua ATCC51742 had comparable D- and z-values to the three strains of L. monocytogenes and thus can be used for validation of pasteurization processes to control L. monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon and potentially other ready-to-eat thermolabile food products.

"Didimosphenia geminata (""didymo""), has become a powerful and devastating river plague in Chile. A system was developed in D. geminata channels with the purpose evaluating the effects of water polluted with didymo on the activation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) spermatozoa. Results indicate that semen, when activated with uncontaminated river water had an average time of 60+/-21s. When using Powermilt, (a commercial activator), times of 240+/-21s are achieved, while rivers contaminated with D. geminata achieve a motility time of 30+/-12s. Interestingly enough, the kinetic parameters of VSL, VCL and VAP showed no significant changes under all of the conditions. Furthermore, the presence of D. geminata reduces activation time of the samples as the cells age, indicating increased effects in spermatozoa that are conserved for more than 5 days. D. geminata has antioxidant content, represented by polyphenols; 200ppm of polyphenol were obtained in this study per 10g of microalgae. Spermatozoa exposed to these extracts showed a reduction in mobility time in a dose dependent manner, showing an IC50 of 15ppm. The results suggest an effect on spermatozoa activation, possibly due to the release of polyphenols present in contaminated rivers, facilitating the alteration of sperm motility times, without affecting the viability or kinetics of the cells. These findings have important implications for current policy regarding the control of the algae. Current control measures focus on the number of visible species, and not on the compounds that they release, which this study shows, also have a problematic effect on salmon production.",1
"Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants are environmental contaminants that can accumulate in biota. PBDE accumulation in an organism depends on exposure, assimilation efficiency, and elimination/metabolism. Net assimilation efficiency represents the fraction of the contaminant that is retained in the organism after exposure. In the present study, congener-specific estimates of net PBDE assimilation efficiencies were calculated from dietary exposures of juvenile Chinook salmon. The fish were exposed to one to eight PBDE congeners up to 1500 ng total PBDEs/g food. Mean assimilation efficiencies varied from 0.32 to 0.50 for BDE congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154. The assimilation efficiency of BDE49 was significantly greater than 100%, suggesting biotransformation from higher brominated congeners. Whole body concentrations of BDE49 significantly increased with both exposure to increasing concentrations of BDE99 and decreasing fish lipid levels, implying lipid-influenced debromination of BDE99 to BDE49. Excluding BDE49, PBDE assimilation efficiency was not significantly related to the numbers of congeners in the diets, or congener hydrophobicity, but was greater in foods with higher lipid levels. Estimates of PBDE assimilation efficiency can be used in bioaccumulation models to assess threats from PBDE exposure to Chinook salmon health and recovery efforts, as well as to their predators.",0
"Oysters are considered hyper-accumulators of Cu, but the molecular mechanism by which they maintain Cu cell homeostasis is still unclear. ATP-binding cassette protein subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1, P-glycoprotein) can transport a variety of substrates across the cell membrane in aquatic animals. In this study, to provide insight into the roles of ABCB1 in resistance against Cu in oysters, complete cDNA of abcb1 gene in Crassostrea angulata was cloned and analyzed. The complete sequence of C. angulata ABCB1 showed high identity to ABCB1 from other bivalves and contained some classical motifs of ABCB transport proteins. Abcb1 was mainly expressed in the apical epithelial cell of gills and epithelia of mantles. Abcb1 expression and Cu accumulation were also studied in control oysters and oysters exposed to Cu (30, 100, 300 mug/L Cu, 1-15 days). Cu accumulation in the gill and mantle were measured after abcb1 gene interference. The complete sequence of C. angulata ABCB1 showed high identity to ABCB1 from other bivalves and contained some classical motifs of ABCB transport proteins. The mRNA transcript of abcb1 showed hypersensitivity to Cu exposure. A concentration-dependent highest abcb1 mRNA level (up to 5.61-fold to the control) in the gill and mantle existed across all Cu exposure concentrations after 3 days of Cu exposure. The gill and mantle Cu concentration were significantly higher after the abcb1 mRNA interference. According to these results, it is here speculated that ABCB1 may underlie cell protection against Cu in C. angulata.",0
"BACKGROUND: Flavobacterium psychrophilum causes serious fish diseases such RTFS and BCWD, affecting the aquaculture industry worldwide. Commercial vaccines are not available and control of the disease depends on the use of antibiotics. Reliable methods for detection and identification of different isolates of this bacterium could play an important role in the development of good management strategies. The aim of this study was to identify genetic markers for discrimination between isolates. A selection of eight VNTRs from 53 F. psychrophilum isolates from Norway, Chile, Denmark and Scotland were analyzed. The results were compared with previous work on the same pathogen using MLST for genetic differentiation. RESULTS: The VNTR analysis gave a separation between the F. psychrophilum isolates supporting the results of previous MLST work. A higher diversity was found among the Chilean isolates compared to those from Norway, which suggests a more homogenous reservoir in Norway. Transgenerational transmission of F. psychrophilum from other countries, exporting salmon embryos to Chile, may explain the differences in diversity. The same transmission mechanisms could also explain the wide geographical distribution of identical isolates in Norway. But, this could also be a result of movement of smolts and embryos. The selected VNTRs are stable genetic markers and no variation was observed after several passages on agar plates at different temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: These VNTRs are important additions for genotyping of F. psychrophilum isolates. Future studies on VNTRs of F. psychrophilum should include isolates from more host species from a wider geographical area. To get a more robust genotyping the VNTRs should be used in concert with MLST. Future studies of isolates with high and low virulence should focus on identifying virulence markers using VTNRs and MLST.",0
"PAHs were analyzed for samples of seawater, sediment, and oyster (Saccostrea cucullata) collected from Yangshan Port, East China between 2012 and 2013. Concentrations of summation operatorPAHs in seawater (180-7,700 ng/L) and oyster (1,100-29,000 ng/g dry weight (dw)) fell at the higher end of the global concentration range, while sediment concentrations (120-780 ng/g dw) were generally comparable to or lower than those reported elsewhere. PAHs in the particulate phase accounted for 85% (52-93%) of the total PAHs in seawater. Congener profile analysis revealed that PAHs in waters originate mainly from petrogenic sources, while high-temperature combustion processes are the predominant sources for sediment. summation operatorPAHs in oyster well correlated with summation operatorPAHs in the particulate phase, suggesting particle ingestion as an important pathway for bioaccumulation of PAHs. Cancer risk assessment of PAHs in oyster indicated high human health risks posed by these chemicals to the coastal population consuming this seafood.",1
"Interleukin-6 (IL6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with important immunoregulatory functions. Its expression is inducible in immune cells and tissues of several fish species. We also found that IL6 mRNA abundance was significantly increased in spleen, liver, and gill of rainbow trout after experimental infection with Aeromonas salmonicida. Genomic DNA sequences of IL6 orthologs from three salmonid species revealed a conserved exon/intron structure and a high overall nucleotide identity of >88%. To uncover key mechanisms regulating IL6 expression in salmonid fish, we amplified a fragment of the proximal IL6 promoter from rainbow trout and identified in-silico conserved binding sites for NF-kappaB and CEBP. The activity of this IL6 promoter fragment was analyzed in the established human embryonic kidney line HEK-293. Luciferase- and GFP-based reporter systems revealed that the proximal IL6 promoter is activated by Escherichia coli. Essentially, both reporter systems proved that NF-kappaB p50, but not NF-kappaB p65 or CEBP, activates the IL6 promoter fragment. Truncation of this fragment caused a significant decrease in IL6 promoter activation. This characterization of the proximal promoter of the IL6-encoding gene provides basic knowledge about the IL6 gene expression in rainbow trout.",0
"Spatial and temporal distributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in Eastern Guangdong coast, China. Total PAH concentrations in oysters ranged from 231 to 1178ng/g with a mean concentration of 622ng/g dry weight. Compared with other bays and estuaries, PAH levels in oysters were moderate. Spatial distribution of PAHs was site specific, with relatively high PAH concentrations observed in Zhelin Bay and Kaozhouyang Bay. Based on the Spearman test analysis, only PAH concentration in oysters from Jiazi Harbor showed a significant increasing trend (P<0.05). Three-ring PAHs were the most abundant, accounting for 54.2%-88.4% of total PAHs. Diagnostic ratios suggested that PAHs were derived mainly from petroleum origin. BaP and summation operator4PAH concentrations were well within the European Union limits (5ng/g and 30ng/g wet weight, respectively). The incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCR) for PAHs were <10(-5), indicating that the adverse health risks associated with oyster consumption in this area were minimal.",0
"Salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis are an ecologically and economically important parasite of wild and farmed salmon. In Scotland, Norway, and Eastern Canada, L. salmonis have developed resistance to emamectin benzoate (EMB), one of the few parasiticides available for salmon lice. Drug resistance mechanisms can be complex, potentially differing among populations and involving multiple genes with additive effects (i.e., polygenic resistance). Indicators of resistance development may enable early detection and countermeasures to avoid the spread of resistance. Here, we collect sensitive Pacific L. salmonis and sensitive and resistant Atlantic L. salmonis from salmon farms, propagate in laboratory (F1), expose to EMB in bioassays, and evaluate either baseline (Atlantic only) or induced transcriptomic differences between populations. In all populations, induced responses were minor and a cellular stress response was not identified. Pacific lice did not upregulate any genes in response to EMB, but downregulated degradative enzymes and transport proteins at 50 ppb EMB. Baseline differences between sensitive and now resistant Atlantic lice were much greater than responses to exposures. All resistant lice overexpressed degradative enzymes, and resistant males, the most resistant group, overexpressed collagenases to the greatest extent. These results indicate an accumulation of baseline expression differences related to resistance.",1
"Sea lice are one of the main parasites affecting the salmon aquaculture industry, causing significant economic losses worldwide. Increased resistance to traditional chemical treatments has created the need to find alternative control methods. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the transcriptome response of the salmon louse Caligus rogercresseyi to the delousing drug deltamethrin (AlphaMax). Through bioassays with different concentrations of deltamethrin, adult salmon lice transcriptomes were sequenced from cDNA libraries in the MiSeq Illumina platform. A total of 78 million reads for females and males were assembled in 30,212 and 38,536 contigs, respectively. De novo assembly yielded 86,878 high-quality contigs and, based on published data, it was possible to annotate and identify relevant genes involved in several biological processes. RNA-seq analysis in conjunction with heatmap hierarchical clustering evidenced that pyrethroids modify the ectoparasitic transcriptome in adults, affecting molecular processes associated with the nervous system, cuticle formation, oxidative stress, reproduction, and metabolism, among others. Furthermore, sex-related transcriptome differences were evidenced. Specifically, 534 and 1033 exclusive transcripts were identified for males and females, respectively, and 154 were shared between sexes. For males, estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase, sphingolipid delta4-desaturase DES1, ketosamine-3-kinase, and arylsulfatase A, among others, were discovered, while for females, vitellogenin 1, glycoprotein G, transaldolase, and nitric oxide synthase were among those identified. The shared transcripts included annotations for tropomyosin, gamma-crystallin A, glutamate receptor-metabotropic, glutathione S-transferase, and carboxipeptidase B. The present study reveals that deltamethrin generates a complex transcriptome response in C. rogercresseyi, thus providing valuable genomic information for developing new delousing drugs.",0
"The concentration of 51 parent and alkylated PAHs was examined in oysters, Ostrea equestris, and corals, Tubastrea coccinea, collected from oil-rig structures off the coast of Louisiana during April and May 2011 to investigate their potential use as monitors for offshore contamination events. Corals and oysters collected from both sampling trips had lower PAH accumulation than most bivalves collected in previous studies near the shoreline of Louisiana and elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. In April, total PAH (TPAH) concentrations ranged from 8.73 to 15.17 ng g(-1) in corals and 2.52 to 22.04 ng g(-1) in oysters. In May, corals and oysters had elevated concentrations of TPAH ranging from 24.28 to 79.23 ng g(-1) and 7.18 to 95.55 ng g(-1), respectively. This increase could be a result of Mississippi River flooding that occurred during that time, as evidenced by the high perylene concentrations (3.92-41.49 ng g(-1)) measured in May oysters. Oysters and corals collected in May from MC21B, the closest rig to the Mississippi River Delta, had the highest TPAH concentrations observed among all locations and the only rig to have predominantly petrogenic source inputs. Overall, given the low baseline of PAHs demonstrated in this study and the rapid accumulation of diagnostic chemicals in response to a possible contamination event (i.e. sediment plume from May flooding), oil-rig invertebrates could make excellent monitoring tools to examine the exposure to and recovery from oil (and oil-spill response options) in the offshore Northern Gulf of Mexico. Pre-spill baseline data of chemical and biological biomarkers of contamination is key to better estimating the impacts and recovery of oil exposure. Therefore, this screen of PAH accumulation represents a crucial first step in determining baseline contaminant levels in order to utilize these unique resources as monitors for offshore oil exposure in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.",0
"Olaquindox (OLA), mequindox (MEQ), and quincetone (QCT) are widely used synthetic antibiotics of the quinoxaline-1,4-dioxide family. However, no studies have focused on the detection of sum of OLA, MEQ, and QCT by mAb-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this study, a specific mAb 2F3 against OLA, MEQ, and QCT was successfully prepared. Furthermore, using the mAb 2F3, an indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) was developed using MQCA (quinoxaline marker) coupled to OVA as the heterologous coating antigen. Under optimized assay conditions, the IC50 values were 1.03, 1.54, and 1.73 ng ml-1 for OLA, MEQ, and QCT, respectively. The recoveries ranged from 82.1% to 96.3%, and no cross-reactivity with other compounds was detected except for carbadox (0.9%). The developed icELISA was rapid and reliable for the determination of sum of OLA, MEQ, and QCT in fish feed.",0
"In this study, As-, Pb-, and Cu-contaminated soil was stabilized using calcined oyster shells (COS) and steel slag (SS). The As-contaminated soil was obtained from a timber mill site where chromate copper arsenate (CCA) was used as a preservative. On the other hand, Pb- and Cu-contaminated soil was obtained from a firing range. These two soils were thoroughly mixed to represent As-, Pb-, and Cu-contaminated soil. Calcined oyster shells were obtained by treating waste oyster shells at a high temperature using the calcination process. The effectiveness of stabilization was evaluated by 1-N HCl extraction for As and 0.1-N HCl extraction for Pb and Cu. The treatment results showed that As, Pb, and Cu leachability were significantly reduced upon the combination treatment of COS and SS. The sole treatment of SS (10 wt%) did not show effective stabilization. However, the combination treatment of COS and SS showed a significant reduction in As, Pb, and Cu leachability. The best stabilization results were obtained from the combination treatment of 15 wt% COS and 10 wt% SS. The SEM-EDX results suggested that the effective stabilization of As was most probably achieved by the formation of Ca-As and Fe-As precipitates. In the case of Pb and Cu, stabilization was most probably associated with the formation of pozzolanic reaction products such as CSHs and CAHs.",0
"Cyclophilins (CyPs) are a family of proteins that bind the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (CsA) with high-affinity and belong to one of the three superfamilies of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIase). In this report, three cyclophilin genes (Ca-CyPs), including Ca-CyPA, Ca-CyPB and Ca-PPIL3, were identified from oyster, Crassostrea ariakensis Gould in which Ca-CyPA encodes a protein with 165 amino acid sequences, Ca-CyPB encodes a protein with 217 amino acid sequences and Ca-PPIL3 encodes a protein with 162 amino acid sequences. All of the three Ca-CyPs genes contain a typical CyP-PPIase domain with its signature sequences and Ca-CyPB contains an N-signal peptide sequences. Tissue distribution study revealed that Ca-CyPs were ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues and the highest levels were observed in hemocytes. RLO incubation upregulated the mRNA expression levels of Ca-CyPs, indicating that three Ca-CyPs might be involved in oyster immune response against RLO infection.",0
"Arsenosugars are water-soluble arsenic species predominant in marine algae and other seafood including mussels and oysters. They typically occur at levels ranging from 2 to 50mg arsenic/kg dry weight. Most of the arsenosugars contain arsenic as a dimethylarsinoyl group (Me2As(O)-), commonly referred to as the oxo forms, but thio analogues have also been identified in marine organisms and as metabolic products of oxo-arsenosugars. So far, no data regarding toxicity and toxicokinetics of thio-arsenosugars are available. This in vitro-based study indicates that thio-dimethylarsenosugar-glycerol exerts neither pronounced cytotoxicity nor genotoxicity even though this arsenical was bioavailable to human hepatic (HepG2) and urothelial (UROtsa) cells. Experiments with the Caco-2 intestinal barrier model mimicking human absorption indicate for the thio-arsenosugar-glycerol higher intestinal bioavailability as compared to the oxo-arsenosugars. Nevertheless, absorption estimates were much lower in comparison to other arsenicals including arsenite and arsenic-containing hydrocarbons. Arsenic speciation in cell lysates revealed that HepG2 cells are able to metabolise the thio-arsenosugar-glycerol to some extent to dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). These first in vitro data cannot fully exclude risks to human health related to the presence of thio-arsenosugars in food.",0
"Juvenile pink salmon larger than 0.7 g reject the sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, and are considered resistant to the infection. Robust innate defense responses in the skin contribute to the observed resistance. In contrast adult pink salmon captured at sea or shortly before spawning carry large numbers of the parasite, suggesting inability to control the infection. The purpose of this research is to better understand these apparently contradictory conclusions by comparing a suite of genetic and cellular markers of resistance to L. salmonis in the skin of juvenile and mature pink salmon. The expression of major histocompatibility factor II, C-reactive protein, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8 and cyclooxygenase-2 was down-regulated in mature but not juvenile pink salmon. Similarly, skin at the site of parasite attachment in juvenile salmon was highly populated with MHIIbeta(+) and IL-1beta(+) cells that were either absent, or at reduced levels at similar sites in mature salmon. In addition, mucocyte density was relatively low in the skin of mature salmon, irrespective of louse infection. In juveniles, the higher mucocyte density decreased following louse attachment. We show that in mature pink salmon, genetic and histological responses in skin are depressed and speculate that salmonid defense against L. salmonis is modulated by maturation.",0
"Marine molluscs, such as oysters, respond to estrogenic compounds with the induction of the egg yolk protein precursor, vitellogenin (Vtg), availing a biomarker for estrogenic pollution. Despite this application, the precise molecular mechanism through which estrogens exert their action to induce molluscan vitellogenesis is unknown. As a first step to address this question, we cloned a gene encoding Vtg from the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata (sgVtg). Using primers designed from a partial sgVtg cDNA sequence available in Genbank, a full-length sgVtg cDNA of 8498bp was obtained by 5'- and 3'-RACE. The open reading frame (ORF) of sgVtg was determined to be 7980bp, which is substantially longer than the orthologs of other oyster species. Its deduced protein sequence shares the highest homology at the N- and C-terminal regions with other molluscan Vtgs. The full-length genomic DNA sequence of sgVtg was obtained by genomic PCR and genome walking targeting the gene body and flanking regions, respectively. The genomic sequence spans 20kb and consists of 30 exons and 29 introns. Computer analysis identified three closely spaced half-estrogen responsive elements (EREs) in the promoter region and a 210-bp CpG island 62bp downstream of the transcription start site. Upregulation of sgVtg mRNA expression was observed in the ovaries following in vitro (explants) and in vivo (tank) exposure to 17beta-estradiol (E2). Notably, treatment with an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist in vitro abolished the upregulation, suggesting a requirement for an estrogen-dependent receptor for transcriptional activation. DNA methylation of the 5' CpG island was analysed using bisulfite genomic sequencing of the in vivo exposed ovaries. The CpG island was found to be hypomethylated (with 0-3% methylcytosines) in both control and E2-exposed oysters. However, no significant differential methylation or any correlation between methylation and sgVtg expression levels was observed. Overall, the results support the possible involvement of an ERE-containing promoter and an estrogen-activated receptor in estrogen signalling in marine molluscs.",0
"Here, we assess the physiological effects induced by environmental concentrations of pesticides in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Oysters were exposed for 14 d to trace levels of metconazole (0.2 and 2 mug/L), isoproturon (0.1 and 1 mug/L), or both in a mixture (0.2 and 0.1 mug/L, respectively). Exposure to trace levels of pesticides had no effect on the filtration rate, growth, and energy reserves of oysters. However, oysters exposed to metconazole and isoproturon showed an overactivation of the sensing-kinase AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha), a key enzyme involved in energy metabolism and more particularly glycolysis. In the meantime, these exposed oysters showed a decrease in hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities, whereas 2-DE proteomic revealed that fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F-1,6-BP), a key enzyme of gluconeogenesis, was up-regulated. Activities of antioxidant enzymes were higher in oysters exposed to the highest pesticide concentrations. Both pesticides enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity of oysters. Isoproturon enhanced catalase activity, and metconazole enhanced peroxiredoxin activity. Overall, our results show that environmental concentrations of metconazole or isoproturon induced subtle changes in the energy and antioxidant metabolisms of oysters.",1
"To speed up sedimentation of suspended solids the mining industry often uses flocculent chemicals. In this work we evaluated the cytotoxic and mechanistic effects of Polydadmac, and its basic component Dadmac, on fish cells. Dose-response effects, temperature-dependent effects and impact of Dadmac and Polydadmac on Cu toxicity were studied in Atlantic salmon hepatocytes. We used the xCELLigence system and the MTT test for cytotoxicity assessments, and real-time RT-qPCR to evaluate molecular effects. The results showed a cytotoxic response for Polydadmac but not for Dadmac. Elevated levels of Cu were cytotoxic. Moderately cytotoxic concentrations of Cu (100-1000 muM) induced significant responses on the transcription of a number of genes in the cells, i.e. cuznsod (sod1), cat, mnsod (sod2), nfe2l2, hmox1, mta, casp3b, casp6, bclx, cyp1a, ccs, atp7a, app, mmp13, esr1, ppara, fads2 and ptgs2. A factorial PLS regression model for mnsod transcription showed a synergistic effect between Dadmac and Cu exposure in the cells, indicating an interaction effect between Dadmac and Cu on mitochondrial ROS scavenging. No interaction effects were seen for Polydadmac on Cu toxicity. In conclusion, Polydadmac is cytotoxic at elevated concentrations but appears to have low ability to interfere with Cu toxicity in Atlantic salmon liver cells.",0
"Pancreas disease (PD) in Norwegian salmonid aquaculture has traditionally been caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV) subtype 3. Following the isolation of a novel SAV subtype in 2010, marine SAV2, two separate endemic areas have developed. It has been debated whether disease outbreaks due to marine SAV2 result in milder clinical manifestations compared to outbreaks caused by SAV3. The aim of this study was to descriptively investigate site-level differences in the clinical manifestations of marine SAV2 and SAV3 at Norwegian seawater sites diagnosed with PD in 2012. The findings suggest that Norwegian PD outbreaks caused by marine SAV2 result in lower mortality and milder clinical signs compared to outbreaks caused by SAV3. For sites without reported PD-related mortality, there was no difference in the mortality levels between sites infected by marine SAV2 and SAV3. The results also indicate that there are no differences in grading quality at slaughter between the SAV subtypes.",1
"The replacement of fish oil (FO) with a DHA-rich Schizochytrium sp. algal meal (AM) at two inclusion levels (11% and 5.5% of diet) was tested in Atlantic salmon post-smolts compared to fish fed a FO diet of northern (NFO) or southern hemisphere (SFO) origin. Fish were preconditioned prior to the 19-week experimental feeding period to reduce long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) and persistent organic pollutant levels (POPs). Dietary POP levels differed significantly between treatments in the order of NFO>SFO>11 AM/5.5 AM and were subsequently reflected in the flesh. Fish fed the 11 AM diet contained similar DHA levels (g 100 g(-1) flesh) to FO-fed fish, despite percentage differences. However, the low levels of EPA in the diets and flesh of algal-fed fish compromised the overall nutritional value to the final consumer. Nevertheless, further developments in microalgae culture offer a promising alternative lipid source of LC-PUFA to FO in salmon feeds that warrants further investigation.",0
"Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is an orthomyxovirus, which may cause multisystemic disease and high mortality of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L). This suggests that ISAV encodes proteins that antagonize the type I interferon (IFN-I) system, which is of crucial importance in innate antiviral immunity. To find out how ISAV might inhibit IFN-I synthesis, we have here studied whether the two ISAV proteins s7ORF1 and s8ORF2 might interfere with activation of the IFNa1 promoter mediated by overexpression of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) or by the IFN promoter activation protein IPS-1. The IRF tested were IRF1, IRF3, IRF7A and IRF7B. Promoter activation was measured using a luciferase reporter assay where Atlantic salmon TO cells were co-transfected with the IFNa1 promoter reporter plasmid together with an IRF plasmid and the s7ORF1 or the s8ORF2 construct or a control plasmid. The results showed that s7ORF1 significantly inhibited IRF3 and IRF7B induced IFN promoter activity, while s8ORF2 significantly inhibited IRF1 and IRF3 induced promoter activity. Neither s7ORF1 nor s8ORF2 inhibited IPS-1 mediated promoter activation. Immunoprecipitation data suggest that both s7ORF1 and s8ORF2 can bind to all four IRFs. Taken together, this study thus shows that the ISAV proteins s7ORF1 and s8ORF2 antagonizes IFN-I transcription activation mediated by the IRFs. As such this work provides further insight into the pathogenic properties of ISAV.",0
"Serious losses have occurred at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Craig Brook National Fish Hatchery, East Orland, Maine, among eggs that were taken from Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar, which were held as captive broodfish during their returns to the Penobscot River, Naraguagus River, and Machias River to spawn. Bacterial isolations were attempted from external surfaces and the internal contents of individual eggs. Externally and in all cases, Pseudomonas fluorescens was the predominant bacterium associated with the surface of all eggs. These bacteria were resistant to a surface treatment of 1,667 ppm formalin for 15 min and, therefore, the monoclonal nature of P. fluorescens on egg surfaces was considered to result from its ability to resist the germicidal activity of formalin administered for antifungal treatments. Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the cause of bacterial coldwater disease, was isolated from the interior of 23.6, 18.1, and 29.2% of the dead Atlantic Salmon eggs from Penobscot River egg lots A-98, A-100, and A-101, respectively, and concentrations of this pathogen ranged from 1.0 x 10(3) to >5 x 10(8) CFU per gram of dead egg. Flavobacterium psychrophilum was also isolated from 8.3, 26.7, and 10.0% of the dead eggs from Naraguagus River egg lots N-158, N-161, and N-163, respectively, in which concentrations of this organism ranged from 1.0 x 10(3) to 7.5 x 10(8) CFU per gram of egg. This bacterium was also isolated from within 18.3% and 3.3% of the dead eggs from Machias River egg lots M-128 and M-142, respectively, and its concentrations ranged from 1.0 x 10(3) to 1.5 x 10(8) CFU per gram of egg. The finding of F. psychrophilum from within these eggs is indicative of this pathogen's widespread and persistent prevalence in Atlantic Salmon in New England.",0
"Daily variation in the absorption, metabolism and excretion of toxic substances will ultimately determine the actual concentration to which the cells and tissues are exposed. In aquaculture, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) can be frequently exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to treat topical skin and gill infections, particularly in relation to parasitic infections (e.g. sea lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis and amoebic gill disease caused by Neoparamoeba perurans). It is well accepted that the time of administration influences pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs which in turn affects their efficacy and toxicity. Consequently, a better understanding of drug side effects as a function of time of day exposure would help to improve treatment efficacy and fish welfare. To this end, salmon were exposed to H2O2 (1500 mg/L) for 20 min at six different times of the day during a 24-h cycle and we investigated the time-dependent effects of exposure on physiological stress (glucose, lactate and cortisol) and antioxidant enzyme expression (gpx1, cat, Mn-sod and hsp70) in liver and gills. In addition, at each sampling point, 8 control fish were also sampled. Our results revealed that the time of administration of H2O2 caused significant differences in the induction of both physiological and oxidative stress responses. Glucose and lactate were higher in the treated fish during daytime whereas cortisol levels appeared to be systematically increased (>1000 ng/mL) after H2O2 treatment irrespective of exposure time, although differences with control levels were higher during the day. In liver, gene expression of antioxidant enzymes displayed daily rhythmicity in both treated and control groups and showed higher mRNA expression levels in salmon treated with H2O2 at ZT6 (6 h after lights onset). In gills, rhythmic expression was only found for gpx1 in the control fish and for hsp70 and Mn-sod in the treated groups. However, in the treated salmon, higher gene expression levels of all the investigated enzymes were also observed at ZT6-10. Clock gene expression showed rhythmicity only in the liver in accordance with the daily rhythm of enzyme expression observed in this tissue. Altogether, this study provides first evidence of chronotoxicity in Atlantic salmon treated with H2O2 and suggests increased sublethal toxic effect during the first half of the day. These results have direct relevance to the salmon and broader aquaculture industry by optimising the timing of treatment administration, opening the door to chronotherapy to treat fish diseases.",0
"BACKGROUND: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family encode for membrane proteins involved in the transport of various biomolecules through the cellular membrane. These proteins have been identified in all taxa and present important physiological functions, including the process of insecticide detoxification in arthropods. For that reason the ectoparasite Caligus rogercresseyi represents a model species for understanding the molecular underpinnings involved in insecticide drug resistance. METHODS: llumina sequencing was performed using sea lice exposed to 2 and 3 ppb of deltamethrin and azamethiphos. Contigs obtained from de novo assembly were annotated by Blastx. RNA-Seq analysis was performed and validated by qPCR analysis. RESULTS: From the transcriptome database of C. rogercresseyi, 57 putative members of ABC protein sequences were identified and phylogenetically classified into the eight subfamilies described for ABC transporters in arthropods. Transcriptomic profiles for ABC proteins subfamilies were evaluated throughout C. rogercresseyi development. Moreover, RNA-Seq analysis was performed for adult male and female salmon lice exposed to the delousing drugs azamethiphos and deltamethrin. High transcript levels of the ABCB and ABCC subfamilies were evidenced. Furthermore, SNPs mining was carried out for the ABC proteins sequences, revealing pivotal genomic information. CONCLUSIONS: The present study gives a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of ABC proteins from C. rogercresseyi, providing relevant information about transporter roles during ontogeny and in relation to delousing drug responses in salmon lice. This genomic information represents a valuable tool for pest management in the Chilean salmon aquaculture industry.",0
"Annual mean total length (LT) of wild one-sea-winter (1SW) Atlantic salmon Salmo salar of the Norwegian River Imsa decreased from 63 to 54 cm with a corresponding decrease in condition factor (K) for cohorts migrating to sea from 1976 to 2010. The reduction in LT is associated with a 40% decline in mean individual mass, from 2 to 1.2 kg. Hatchery fish reared from parental fish of the same population exhibited similar changes from 1981 onwards. The decrease in LT correlated negatively with near-surface temperatures in the eastern Norwegian Sea, thought to be the main feeding area of the present stock. Furthermore, S. salar exhibited significant variations in the proportion of cohorts attaining maturity after only one winter in the ocean. The proportion of S. salar spawning as 1SW fish was lower both in the 1970s and after 2000 than in the 1980s and 1990s associated with a gradual decline in post-smolt growth and smaller amounts of reserve energy in the fish. In wild S. salar, there was a positive association between post-smolt growth and the sea survival back to the River Imsa for spawning. In addition, among smolt year-classes, there were significant positive correlations between wild and hatchery S. salar in LT, K and age at maturity. The present changes may be caused by ecosystem changes following the collapse and rebuilding of the pelagic fish abundance in the North Atlantic Ocean, a gradual decrease in zooplankton abundance and climate change with increasing surface temperature in the Norwegian Sea. Thus, the observed variation in the life-history traits of S. salar appears primarily associated with major changes in the pelagic food web in the ocean.",0
"The influence of environmental parameters on the total and pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus seasonal densities in American oysters (Crassostrea virginica) was evaluated for 1 year. Harvesting site A yielded the highest mean densities of V. parahaemolyticus tlh+, tdh+/trh-, tdh-/trh+ and tdh+/trh+ during spring season at 2.57, 1.74, 0.36, and -0.40 log10 MPN/g, respectively, and tdh+/orf8+ during winter season (0.90 log10 MPN/g). V. parahaemolyticus tlh+ densities were associated to salinity (R(2)=0.372, P<0.022), tdh+/trh+ to turbidity (R(2)=0.597, P<0.035), and orf8+ to temperature, salinity, and pH (R(2)=0.964, P<0.001). The exposure to salinity and temperature conditions during winter and spring seasons regulated the dynamics of V. parahaemolyticus harboring potentially pathogenic genotypes within the oyster. The adaptive response of V. parahaemolyticus to seasonal environmental changes may lead to an increase in survival and virulence, threatening the seafood safety and increasing the risk of illness.",1
"Salmon is a popular food but it is easily susceptible to spoilage by contamination with microorganisms. In this study, a method using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-based solid-phase extraction (SPE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry was developed and applied to reveal the effect of Pseudomonas fluorescens on salmon fillet during the shelf-life period by measuring the changes in the levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Fresh samples were inoculated with P. fluorescens (10(6) cfu g(-1)) for 30 s, and lipids were extracted at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. A homemade SPE cartridge packed with HILIC sorbent (silica derivatized with 1,2-dihydroxypropane) was used for matrix cleanup prior to analysis by mass spectrometry. In total, 30 phospholipids and 16 lysophospholipids were detected and elucidated. The results revealed that the content of phospholipids decreased significantly, whereas that of lysophospholipids increased initially, followed by a gradual reduction as the cold storage time increased. The contamination by P. fluorescens negatively affected the quality of fresh salmon without obvious physical changes, but it posed a potential threat to human health. This study suggests that the well-established method could be used for detecting phospholipids in salmon fillet and perhaps other foods as well.",0
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) is currently a major cause of bacterial diarrhoea associated with seafood consumption. The objective of this study was to determine the inactivation effect of curcumin-mediated photodynamic action on V. parahaemolyticus. First of all, V. parahaemolyticus suspended in PBS buffer was irradiated by a visible light from a LED light source with an energy density of 3.6J/cm(2). Colony forming units (CFU) were counted and the viability of V. parahaemolyticus cells was calculated after treatment. Singlet oxygen ((1)O2) production after photodynamic action of curcumin was evaluated using 9,10-Anthracenediyl-bis (methylene) dimalonic acid (ADMA). Bacterial outer membrane protein was extracted and analyzed using electrophoresis SDS-PAGE. DNA and RNA of V. parahaemolyticus were also extracted and analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis after photodynamic treatment. Finally, the efficacy of photodynamic action of curcumin was preliminarily evaluated in the decontamination of V. parahaemolyticus in oyster. Results showed that the viability of V. parahaemolyticus was significantly decreased to non-detectable levels over 6.5-log reductions with the curcumin concentration of 10 and 20muM. Photodynamic action of curcumin significantly increased the singlet oxygen level with the curcumin concentration of 10muM. Notable damage was found to bacterial outer membrane proteins and genetic materials after photodynamic treatment. Photodynamic action of curcumin reduced the number of V. parahaemolyticus contaminating in oyster to non-detectable level. Our findings demonstrated that photodynamic action of curcumin could be a potentially good method to inactivate Vibrio parahaemolyticus contaminating in oyster.",0
"Field and in vitro studies have shown that high salinities and temperatures promote the proliferation and dissemination of Perkinsus marinus in several environments. In Brazil, the parasite infects native oysters Crassostrea gasar and Crassostrea rhizophorae in the Northeast (NE), where the temperature is high throughout the year. Despite the high prevalence of Perkinsus spp. infection in oysters from the NE of Brazil, no mortality events were reported by oyster farmers to date. The present study evaluated the effects of salinity (5, 20 and 35 psu) and temperature (15, 25 and 35 degrees C) on in vitro proliferation of P. marinus isolated from a host (C. rhizophorae) in Brazil, for a period of up to 15 days and after the return to the control conditions (22 days; recovery). Different cellular parameters (changes of cell phase's composition, cell density, viability and production of reactive oxygen species) were analysed using flow cytometry. The results indicate that the P. marinus isolate was sensitive to the extreme salinities and temperatures analysed. Only the highest temperature caused lasting cell damage under prolonged exposure, impairing P. marinus recovery, which is likely to be associated with oxidative stress. These findings will contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of perkinsiosis in tropical regions.",0
"Plasmids expressing interferon (IFN) have recently been shown to function as adjuvants in Atlantic salmon when co-injected with a DNA vaccine encoding hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) from infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). In this work we have compared the antibody kinetics and the systemic Mx/ISG15 response of fish vaccinated with HE-plasmid using either IFNa plasmid (pIFNa) or pIFNc as adjuvants over a longer time period, i.e. 22 weeks post vaccination (pv). The results showed that the antibody response against ISAV with pIFNa as adjuvant arose earlier (7 weeks pv) than with pIFNc as adjuvant (10 weeks pv), peaked at week 10 and declined at week 22. The antibody response with pIFNc as adjuvant peaked at 16 weeks and kept at this level 22 weeks pv. Fish injected with pIFNc alone expressed high levels of Mx and ISG15 in liver throughout the 22 week period. In contrast, fish injected with pIFNc together with HE-plasmid expressed high levels of Mx and ISG15 in liver for the first 10 weeks, but at week 16 this response was absent in two of three fish at week 16 and was absent in all tested fish at week 22 pv. This suggests that cells expressing HE and IFNc are intact at week 10 pv, but are eliminated by adaptive immune responses after week 10 due to recognition of HE. The longevity of the Mx/ISG15 response in pIFNc treated fish is likely due to the fact that IFNc is a self-antigen of salmon and is not attacked by the adaptive immune system.",0
"Alpha-2 macroglobulin (alpha2M) is a ubiquitous protease inhibitor and considered to be an evolutionarily conserved constituent of innate host defence system. Here, an alpha2M gene (designated as Pfalpha2M) was obtained from the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata by RT-PCR, PCR walking and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The Pfalpha2M cDNA consists of 6394 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 5745 bp encoding a protein of 1914 amino acids with a 19 residues signal peptide. Pfalpha2M sequence contains three putative functional domains, including a bait region, a thiol ester domain and a receptor-binding domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Pfalpha2M is closely related to the alpha2Ms from other molluscs. Pfalpha2M was expressed in all tested tissues including digestive gland, gill, adductor muscle, mantle and foot, while the highest expression was found in hemocytes. Following challenge with Vibrio alginolyticus, Pfalpha2M expression in hemocytes was significantly up-regulated at 2 h and then returned to the original level at 48 h. Knockdown of Pfalpha2M by RNA interference significantly reduced the phagocytosis of V. alginolyticus by hemocytes in vivo, and similar results were obtained upon chemical inactivation of the reactive thioester bond in Pfalpha2M by methylamine treatment. Taken together, it is suggested that Pfalpha2M is an immune-relevant molecule and involved in phagocytosis of V. alginolyticus by P. fucata hemocytes, and the function of Pfalpha2M in phagocytosis is dependent on the active thioester bond.",0
"Radionuclides are a special group of substances posing both radiological and chemical hazards to organisms. As a preliminary approach to understand the combined effects of radionuclides, exposure studies were designed using gamma radiation (Gamma) and depleted uranium (DU) as stressors, representing a combination of radiological (radiation) and chemical (metal) exposure. Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed to 70mGy external Gamma dose delivered over the first 5h of a 48h period (14mGy/h), 0.25mg/L DU were exposed continuously for 48h and the combination of the two stressors (Combi). Water and tissue concentrations of U were determined to assess the exposure quality and DU bioaccumulation. Hepatic gene expression changes were determined using microarrays in combination with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Effects at the higher physiological levels were determined as plasma glucose (general stress) and hepatic histological changes. The results show that bioaccumulation of DU was observed after both single DU and the combined exposure. Global transcriptional analysis showed that 3122, 2303 and 3460 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly regulated by exposure to gamma, DU and Combi, respectively. Among these, 349 genes were commonly regulated by all treatments, while the majority was found to be treatment-specific. Functional analysis of DEGs revealed that the stressors displayed similar mode of action (MoA) across treatments such as induction of oxidative stress, DNA damage and disturbance of oxidative phosphorylation, but also stressor-specific mechanisms such as cellular stress and injury, metabolic disorder, programmed cell death, immune response. No changes in plasma glucose level as an indicator of general stress and hepatic histological changes were observed. Although no direct linkage was successfully established between molecular responses and adverse effects at the organism level, the study has enhanced the understanding of the MoA of single radionuclides and mixtures of these.",0
"Herbicides are one of the major classes of pollutants contaminating coastal waters over the world. Among them, diuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) is a phenylurea herbicide frequently detected in oyster-producing area, known to be toxic for this important exploited non-target species. With the aim to investigate the mechanisms by which diuron displays its toxicity in oyster, the implication of both biotransformation and oxygen reactive species (ROS) production was studied considering embryotoxicity and genotoxicity as endpoints. Comparative embryotoxicity and genotoxicity of diuron and its main metabolites (DCPMU, DCPU and 3,4-DCA) were thus studied on oyster larvae by the embryo-larval bioassay on D larvae and the comet assay on trochophore larvae, respectively. Exposures were also performed in presence and absence of known ROS scavenger compounds - ascorbic acid and N-acetylcysteine, to evaluate the involvement of oxyradicals in the toxic responses. In the case of diuron, the production of ROS on exposed oyster larvae was also measured using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as a probe for flow cytometric analysis. The results we obtained showed the embryotoxicity and genotoxicity of diuron and its metabolites in early life stages of the Pacific oyster. For concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5mugL(-1), diuron appeared significantly more embryotoxic than DCPMU and DCPU (p<0.001). Embryotoxicity decreased with diuron metabolism as follows: diuron>/=DCPMU=DCPU, highlighting that biotransformation can constitute a true detoxication pathways in oyster larvae by decreasing the toxicity of the parent compound. In the opposite, no difference was observed between diuron and its metabolites concerning larval development when considering a lower and more environmentally realistic range of concentrations (0.002-0.050mugL(-1)). 3,4-DCA was the only compound that did not show any sign of embryotoxicity, even at concentrations up to 5mugL(-1). Concerning genotoxicity, no significant difference was observed between diuron and all of its metabolites including 3, 4 DCA with damages detected from the concentration of 0.05mugL(-1). As for diuron, the toxicity of the metabolites seems to be mediated in some part by ROS production as clearly demonstrated by the decrease in genotoxicity and developmental abnormalities in the presence of the oxidant scavenger, ascorbic acid.",0
"Ribavirin is an antiviral used in human medicine, but it has not been authorized for use in veterinary medicine although it is effective against infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus, between others. In this study, we present a pharmacokinetic profile of ribavirin in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), efficacy prediction indexes, and the measure of its withdrawal time. To determine the pharmacokinetic profile, fishes were orally administered with a single ribavirin dose of 1.6 mg/kg bw, and then, plasma concentrations were measured at different times. From the time-vs.-concentration curve, Cmax = 413.57 ng/mL, Tmax = 6.96 h, AUC = 21394.01 mug.h/mL, t1/2 = 81.61 h, and K10 = 0.0421/h were obtained. Ribavirin reached adequate concentrations during the pharmacokinetic study, with prediction indexes of Cmax /IC50 = 20.7, AUC/IC50 = 1069.7, and T>IC50 = 71 h, where IC is the inhibitory concentration 50%. For ribavirin depletion study, fishes were orally administered with a dairy dose of 1.6 mg/kg bw during 10 days. Concentrations were measured on edible tissue on different days post-treatment. A linear regression of the time vs. concentration was conducted, obtaining a withdrawal time of 1966 degrees C days. Results obtained reveal that the dose of 1.6 mg/kg bw orally administered is effective for ISA virus, originating a reasonable withdrawal period within the productive schedules of Atlantic salmon.",0
"Several studies have reported on the interaction between vitamin A (VA) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-binding toxicants, including poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In aquaculture, the use of plant oils in novel aquafeeds can increase PAH levels while simultaneously lowering natural VA background levels, causing the need to supplement plant oil-based feeds with synthetic VA. To study dietary VA-PAH interactions, Atlantic salmon (initial weight 195+/-0.15g) were fed four identical plant-based diets that were supplemented with PAHs (100 and 10mgkg(-1) benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and phenanthrene (Phe), respectively) or VA (retinyl acetate 8721IUkg(-1)) separately or combined for 2.5 months in a 2x2 factorial design, with triplicate net-pens per diet. Dietary PAH significantly reduced hepatic VA storage, and VA-enriched diets restored hepatic VA. There was a significant PAH-VA interaction effect on hepatic BaP, but not Phe, accumulation, with reduced hepatic BaP concentrations in fish fed VA+PAH compared to fish fed PAH alone. Concurrently, PAH and VA significantly interacted in their effects on CYP1A phase I biotransformation as observed from increased ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, increased CYP1A protein concentration, and elevated transcription (cyp1a1 gene expression) in fish fed PAH+VA compared to PAH alone. Dietary VA supplementation alone had no significant effect on CYP1A phase I biotransformation. Metabolomic assessment showed that dietary VA caused a restoration of metabolic intermediates involved in energy metabolism that were affected by dietary PAH. Moreover, a PAH-induced growth inhibition was partially ameliorated by dietary VA supplementation. In conclusion, dietary VA interacted with PAH toxicity on the level of CYP1A-mediated detoxification, hepatic PAH accumulation, energy allocation, and growth.",0
"Cleaner fish, such as wrasse, are being increasingly used to combat the sea lice infestation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in many European countries. To determine susceptibility of the goldsinny wrasse (Ctenolabrus rupestris L.) and pathogenesis of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) genotype III isolate 12-654, previously associated with VHSV infection in the Shetland Islands in 2012, fish were experimentally challenged by intraperitoneal injection (IP), bath immersion and cohabitation routes. Cumulative proportion of moribund wrasse reached 17% following the virus immersion challenge while by the IP-route moribunds exceeded 50% within 14days post-challenge. Typical signs of VHS as reported in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), were not observed in moribund goldsinny wrasse. The most pronounced histopathological changes, consistent regardless of the route of infection, were observed within the heart and included atrium myofibril degeneration, focal infiltration and multifocal necrosis, with prominent swelling of the endocardium and occasional detachment. Pathological changes in the atrium were associated with presence of the viral antigen as confirmed by a positive immunohistochemical staining. Virus clearance and heart tissue recovery were noted although further experiments are required to confirm these observations. The results of a cohabitation experiment confirmed that goldsinny wrasse shed viable virus and therefore represent a risk of virus transmission to other VHSV susceptible species. Similarities between the pathology in goldsinny wrasse induced through the controlled experimental challenges and that of wrasse spp. from an infection occurrence in Shetland are discussed.",0
"To reduce the ammonia content in the meat of the shark Lamna ditropis, the ammonia-reducing capacity of soaking solutions containing 10% sucrose and 5% NaCl, with or without selected strains of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Misaki-1 and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Lactobacillus plantarum Sanriku-SU8 was evaluated. After the 48 h soaking with the yeast and LAB, ammonia content in the meat was reduced to about from 150 to 50 mg/kg. S. cerevisiae Misaki-1 and L. plantarum Sanriku-SU8 grew well in 10% water extract suspension (AES) of rice bran (nuka). The fermented nuka-AES had a good flavour and demonstrated the ability to reduce the ammonia content of meat from about 290 to 100 mg/kg. These results suggest that soaking treatment with S. cerevisiae Misaki-1 and L. plantarum Sanriku-SU8 can reduce improve salmon shark meat flavour. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Radiotelemetry and archival temperature loggers were used to reconstruct the thermal experience of adult spring Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the highly regulated Willamette River system in Oregon. The study population is threatened and recovery efforts have been hampered by episodically high prespawn mortality that is likely temperature mediated. Over three years, 310 salmon were released with thermal loggers and 68 were recovered in spawning tributaries, primarily at hatchery trapping facilities downstream from high-head dams. More than 190,000 internal body temperature records were collected (mean ~2800 per fish) and associated with 14 main stem and tributary reaches. Most salmon experienced a wide temperature range (minima ~8-10 degrees C; maxima ~13-22 degrees C) and 65% encountered potentially stressful conditions (>/=18 degrees C). The warmest salmon temperatures were in lower Willamette River reaches, where some fish exhibited short-duration behavioral thermoregulation. Cumulative temperature exposure, measured by degree days (DD) above 0 degrees C, varied more than seven-fold among individuals (range=208-1498 DDs) and more than two-fold among sub-basin populations, on average. Overall, ~72% of DDs accrued in tributaries and ~28% were in the Willamette River main stem. DD differences among individuals and populations were related to migration distance, migration duration, and salmon trapping protocols (i.e., extended pre-collection holding in tributaries versus hatchery collection shortly after tributary entry). The combined data provide spatially- and temporally-referenced information on both short-duration stressful temperature exposure and the biologically important total exposure. Thermal exposure in this population complex proximately influences adult salmon physiology, maturation, and disease processes and ultimately affects prespawn mortality and fitness. The results should help managers develop more effective salmon recovery plans in basins with marginal thermal conditions.",0
"BACKGROUND: Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) belongs to the genus Isavirus, family Orthomyxoviridae. ISAV occurs in two basic genotypes, North American and European. The European genotype is more widespread and shows greater genetic variation and greater virulence variation than the North American genotype. To date, all of the ISAV isolates from the clinical disease, ISA, have had deletions in the highly polymorphic region (HPR) on ISAV segment 6 (ISAV-HPRDelta) relative to ISAV-HPR0, named numerically from ISAV-HPR1 to over ISAV-HPR30. ISA outbreaks have only been reported in farmed Atlantic salmon, although ISAV has been detected by RT-PCR in wild fish. It is recognized that asymptomatically ISAV-infected fish exist. There is no universally accepted ISAV RT-qPCR TaqMan(R) assay. Most diagnostic laboratories use the primer-probe set targeting a 104 bp-fragment on ISAV segment 8. Some laboratories and researchers have found a primer-probe set targeting ISAV segment 7 to be more sensitive. Other researchers have published different ISAV segment 8 primer-probe sets that are highly sensitive. METHODS: In this study, we tested 1,106 fish tissue samples collected from (i) market-bought farmed salmonids and (ii) wild salmon from throughout British Columbia (BC), Canada, for ISAV using real time RT-qPCR targeting segment 8 and/or conventional RT-PCR with segment 8 primers and segment 6 HPR primers, and by virus isolation attempts using Salmon head kidney (SHK-1 and ASK-2) cell line monolayers. The sequences from the conventional PCR products were compared by multiple alignment and phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Seventy-nine samples were ""non-negative"" with at least one of these tests in one or more replicates. The ISAV segment 6 HPR sequences from the PCR products matched ISAV variants, HPR5 on 29 samples, one sample had both HPR5 and HPR7b and one matched HPR0. All sequences were of European genotype. In addition, alignment of sequences of the conventional PCR product segment 8 showed they had a single nucleotide mutation in the region of the probe sequence and a 9-nucleotide overlap with the reverse primer sequence of the real time RT-qPCR assay. None of the classical ISAV segment 8 sequences in the GenBank have this mutation in the probe-binding site of the assay, suggesting the presence of a novel ISAV variant in BC. A phylogenetic tree of these sequences showed that some ISAV sequences diverted early from the classical European genotype sequences, while others have evolved separately. All virus isolation attempts on the samples were negative, and thus the samples were considered ""negative"" in terms of the threshold trigger set for Canadian federal regulatory action; i.e., successful virus isolation in cell culture. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published report of the detection of ISAV sequences in fish from British Columbia, Canada. The sequences detected, both of ISAV-HPRDelta and ISAV-HPR0 are of European genotype. These sequences are different from the classical ISAV segment 8 sequences, and this difference suggests the presence of a new ISAV variant of European genotype in BC. Our results further suggest that ISAV-HPRDelta strains can be present without clinical disease in farmed fish and without being detected by virus isolation using fish cell lines.",0
"Sampling in Iliamna Lake, Alaska, U.S.A. revealed that a greater proportion of coastrange sculpins Cottus aleuticus were infected by the cestode Schistocephalus solidus than slimy sculpins Cottus cognatus (52 v. 23%), and infected C. aleuticus contained more cestodes than did C. cognatus (2.1 v. 1.3 per fish). Consumption of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka eggs (the primary diet item) was lower in fishes with cestodes, and a model based on cestode prevalence and age composition estimated higher rates of infection and parasite-associated mortality in C. aleuticus compared with C. cognatus.",0
"Diuron is a substituted phenylurea used as a herbicide to control broadleaf and grass weeds and as a biocidal antifouling agent. Diuron is carcinogenic in rat urinary bladder and toxic to the reproductive system of oysters, sea urchins and lizards. The few studies carried out in human cells do not include the genotoxicity of diuron. We have investigated the toxicity of diuron in human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and human placental choriocarcinoma (BeWo) cells. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was statistically significantly increased in both cell lines but only at the highest 200 muM concentration. Diuron clearly reduced the viability of BeWo, but not MCF-7 cells. The relative cell number was decreased in both cell lines indicative of inhibition of cell proliferation. In the Comet assay, diuron increased DNA fragmentation in MCF-7 but not in BeWo cells. The expressions of p53 protein, a marker for cell stress, and p21 protein, a transcriptional target of p53, were increased, but only in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that diuron is cytotoxic and potentially genotoxic in a tissue-specific manner and that ROS play a role in its toxicity. Thus, exposure to diuron may exert harmful effects on fetal development and damage human health.",0
"Culture suspensions of five clinical and five environmental Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains in 2% NaCl solution were subjected to high pressure processing (HPP) under various conditions (200-300MPa for 5 and 10 min at 1.5-20 degrees C) to study differences in pressure resistance among the strains. The most pressure-resistant and pressure-sensitive strains were selected to investigate the effects of low temperatures (15, 5 and 1.5 degrees C) on HPP (200 or 250MPa for 5 min) to inactivate V. parahaemolyticus in sterile oyster homogenates. Inactivation of V. parahaemolyticus cells in culture suspensions and oyster homogenates was greatly enhanced by lowering the processing temperature from 15 to 5 or 1.5 degrees C. A treatment of oyster homogenates at 250MPa for 5 min at 5 degrees C decreased the populations of V. parahaemolyticus by 6.2logCFU/g for strains 10290 and 100311Y11 and by >7.4logCFU/g for strain 10292. Decreasing the processing temperature of the same treatment to 1.5 degrees C reduced all the V. parahaemolyticus strains inoculated to oyster homogenates to non-detectable (<10CFU/g) levels. Factors including pressure level, processing temperature and time all need to be considered for developing effective HPP for eliminating pathogens from foods. Further studies are needed to validate the efficacy of the HPP (250MPa for 5 min at 1.5 degrees C) in inactivating V. parahaemolyticus cells in whole oysters.",0
"This study characterizes the persistence of human norovirus in Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) held at different seawater temperatures. Oysters were contaminated with human norovirus GI.1 (Norwalk strain 8FIIa) by exposing them to virus-contaminated water at 15 degrees C, and subsequently holding them at 7, 15, and 25 degrees C for up to 6 weeks. Viral RNA was extracted from oyster tissue and hemocytes and quantitated by RT-qPCR. Norovirus was detected in hemocytes and oysters held at 7 and 15 degrees C for 6 weeks and in hemocytes and oysters held at 25 degrees C for up to 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. Results confirm that NoV is quite persistent within oysters and demonstrate that cooler water temperatures extend norovirus clearance times. This study suggests a need for substantial relay times to remove norovirus from contaminated shellfish and suggests that regulatory authorities should consider the effects of water temperature after a suspected episodic norovirus-contamination event.",0
"Several viruses, including Orthomyxovirus, utilize cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) for viral genomic replication and survival within host cells. However, the role of ROS in early events of viral entry and signal induction has not been elucidated. Here, we show that ISA virus (ISAV) induces ROS production very early during infection of CHSE-214 and SHK-1Ycells, and that production is sustained over the observed 24h post-infection. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family is responsible for important signaling pathways. In this study, we report that ISAV activates ERK and p38 in Salmo salar. In salmonid macrophages, while ERK was required for SOD, GLURED, p47phox expression, p38 regulated the ROS production by the NADPH oxidase complex activation. These results, together with the presence of several consensus target motifs for p38 MAPK in the promoter of the S. salar p47phox gene, suggest that p38 MAPK regulates p47phox gene expression in fish through the activation of this key transcription factor.",0
"The salmon louse (Lepeoptheirus salmonis) is a challenge in the farming of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). To treat an infestation, different insecticides are used like the orally administered chitin synthetase inhibitor teflubenzuron. The concentrations and distribution of teflubenzuron were measured in water, organic particles, marine sediment and biota caught in the vicinity of a fish farm following a standard medication. Low concentrations were found in water samples whereas the organic waste from the farm, collected by sediment traps had concentrations higher than the medicated feed. Most of the organic waste was distributed to the bottom close to the farm but organic particles containing teflubenzuron were collected 1100 m from the farm. The sediment under the farm consisted of 5 to 10% organic material and therefore the concentration of teflubenzuron was much lower than in the organic waste. Teflubenzuron was persistent in the sediment with a stipulated halflife of 170 days. Sediment consuming polychaetes had high but decreasing concentrations of teflubenzuron throughout the experimental period, reflecting the decrease of teflubenzuron in the sediment. During medication most wild fauna contained teflubenzuron residues and where polychaetes and saith had highest concentrations. Eight months later only polychaetes and some crustaceans contained drug residues. What dosages that induce mortality in various crustaceans following short or long-term exposure is not known but the results indicate that the concentrations in defined individuals of king crab, shrimp, squat lobster and Norway lobster were high enough shortly after medication to induce mortality if moulting was imminent. Considering food safety, saith and the brown meat of crustaceans contained at first sampling concentrations of teflubenzuron higher than the MRL-value set for Atlantic salmon. The concentrations were, however, moderate and the amount of saith fillet or brown meat of crustaceans to be consumed in order to exceed ADI is relatively large.",1
"OBJECTIVES: Under environmental conditions, fish are simultaneously exposed to multiple stressors. This study provides new knowledge on the effects of controlled exposure to multiple stressors, namely cyanobacterial biomass and food contaminated with arsenic. METHODS: Rainbow trout were divided into six groups of 25 fish and exposed to different contaminant combinations for 30 days: 1) control group, 2) cyanobacterial biomass, 3 & 4) two groups exposed to arsenic at concentrations of 5 mg.kg(-1) and 50 mg.kg(-1) fish feed, and 5 & 6) two groups exposed to cyanobacterial biomass and arsenic combined. We then evaluated pathological, haematological and immunological parameters at 10, 20 and 30 days after exposure. RESULTS: Marked gross pathological findings were present in groups exposed to arsenic and arsenic/cyanobacteria after 30 days. A strong decrease in haemoglobin concentration was observed in all experimental groups receiving arsenic after 10 days exposure. Total leukocyte count increased markedly in fish exposed to cyanobacterial biomass, and to higher arsenic concentrations by the end of the experiment. Neutrophils decreased significantly at the end of exposure. Similarly, exposure to cyanobacteria and/or arsenic led to suppression of opsonised zymosan particle-induced neutrophil respiratory bursts. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the effects of exposure to toxic cyanobacterial biomass and arsenic on fish are enhanced when the contaminants are combined. In particular, long-term exposure led to disturbances in the white blood-cell count. Modulation of phagocytosis, which is the first line of defence against invading pathogens, suggests that the combined action leads to a decreased ability to control infection.",0
"The bactericidal effects of strongly acidic hypochlorous acid water (StAHA) and slightly acidic hypochlorous acid water (SlAHA) against Vibrio parahaemolyticus contaminated on surface of raw fish and shellfish were examined. V. parahaemolyticus contaminated with about 7.0 log CFU/g on the meat chunk of olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), and yellow tail (Seriola quinqueradiata), and 4.0 log CFU/g on the shucked scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) were not detected after washing with StAHA and SlAHA at a ratio of 30:1 on a sample weight basis. However, 1.0 log CFU/g of V. parahaemolyticus was survived on shucked oyster (Crassostrea gigas) under same treatment conditions. The bactericidal effects of acidic hypochlorous acid water against V. parahaemolyticus contaminated on surface of shucked oyster were not as effective as those against V. parahaemolyticus contaminated on surface of meat chunk of olive flounder, yellow tail, and shucked scallop. Such differences can be attributed to the complicated surface conformation of oyster.",0
"Objective. To investigate the contamination of pathogenic Vibrio in oyster in Beijing markets. Methods. Two hundreds of samples were obtained from 80 batches marine products in a wholesale market in Beijing from February to November in 2014. Routine methods were used to detect pathogenic Vibrio in the gills and intestines of oysters. Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates were serotyped. tdh, trh and tlh genes were detected with real time PCR. Results. The isolation rates of pathogenic Vibrio, Vibrio parahaemolytics and Vibrio alginolyticus were 62.50%, 33.75% and 31.25% respectively. The isolation rates of pathogenic Vibrio were 67.50% and 57.50% in gill and intestine samples respectively. Nine serotypes were identified in the isolated Vibrio parahaemolyticus. tdh and trh gene were negative while trh gene was positive in all 27 Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Conclusion. A large proportion of oyster sold in market were contaminated by pathogenic Vibrio and Vibrio parahaemlyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus were the predominant species. Oyster without gills and intestine were safer to consume.",1
"Perkinsus species are notorious unicellular marine parasites that infect commercially important mollusk species including clams and oysters. Recent accumulation of molecular information will greatly facilitate the understanding of Perkinsus biology and development of strategies to control infection. However, the limited availability of methods for genetic manipulation has hindered molecular-based studies of the parasites. In particular, the lack of a drug selection system requires manual isolation of fluorescent cells under a microscope to establish transfected cell lines. Here, we introduce a drug selection system using a glycopeptide antibiotic, bleomycin, and a vector containing the resistance gene Sh-ble. Perkinsus marinus is sensitive to bleomycin, and 100mug/ml of this drug completely blocks its proliferation. Concomitant expression of Sh-ble enables us to specifically select transfected cells in the presence of the drug. We believe that this system provides new opportunities for functional analyses of this parasite.",0
"Skin integrity is recognized as of vital consideration for both animal welfare and final product quality of farmed fish. This study examines the effects of three different rearing temperatures (4, 10 and 16 degrees C) on the skin of healthy Atlantic salmon post-smolts. Changes in skin condition were assessed by the means of skin composition analyses, quantitative histology assessments and transcriptome analysis. Level of protein, vitamin C and vitamin E was significantly higher at 16 degrees C compared with 4 degrees C. Quantitative histology measurements showed that the epidermal thickness decreased from low to high temperature, whereas the epidermal area comprising mucous cells increased. The difference was only significant between 4 and 16 degrees C. Both high and low temperature exhibited significant changes in the skin transcriptome. A number of immune-related transcripts responded at both temperatures. Contrary to well-described immunosuppressive effects of low water temperature on systemic immunity, a subtle increase in skin-mediated immunity was observed, suggesting a pre-activation of the mucosal system at 4 degrees C. Upregulation of a number of heat-shock proteins correlating with a decrease in epidermal thickness suggested a stress response in the skin at high temperature. The results demonstrate distinctive temperature-related effects on the skin of Atlantic salmon.",0
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) is a marine halophilic bacterium that is commonly associated with oysters and shrimp. Human consumption of contaminated shellfish can result in Vp mediated gastroenteritis and severe diarrheal disease. Vp encodes two type 3 secretion systems (T3SS-1 and T3SS2) that have been functionally implicated in cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity respectively. In this study, we profiled protein secretion and temporal promoter activities associated with exsA and exsB gene expression. exsA is an AraC-like transcriptional activator that is critical for activating multiple operons that encode T3SS-1 genes, whereas exsB is thought to encode an outer membrane pilotin component for T3SS-1. The exsBA genetic locus has two predicted promoter elements. The predicted exsB and exsA promoters were individually cloned upstream of luxCDABE genes in reporter plasmid constructs allowing for in situ, real-time quantitative light emission measurements under many growth conditions. Low calcium growth conditions supported maximal exsB and exsA promoter activation. exsB promoter activity exhibited high basal activity and resulted in an exsBA co-transcript. Furthermore, a separate proximal exsA promoter showed initial low basal activity yet eventually exceeded that of exsB and reached maximal levels after 2.5 h corresponding to an entry into early log phase. exsA promoter activity was significantly higher at 30 degrees C than 37 degrees C, which also coincided with increased secretion levels of specific T3SS-1 effector proteins. Lastly, bioinformatic analyses identified a putative expanded ExsA binding motif for multiple transcriptional operons. These findings suggest a two wave model of Vp T3SS-I induction that integrates two distinct promoter elements and environmental signals into a complex ExsA activation framework.",0
"Adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) migrate from salt water to freshwater streams to spawn. Immune responses in migrating adult salmon are thought to diminish in the run up to spawning, though the exact mechanisms for diminished immune responses remain unknown. Here we examine both adaptive and innate immune responses as well as pathogen burdens in migrating adult Chinook salmon in the Upper Willamette River basin. Messenger RNA transcripts encoding antibody heavy chain molecules slightly diminish as a function of time, but are still present even after fish have successfully spawned. In contrast, the innate anti-bacterial effector proteins present in fish plasma rapidly decrease as spawning approaches. Fish also were examined for the presence and severity of eight different pathogens in different organs. While pathogen burden tended to increase during the migration, no specific pathogen signature was associated with diminished immune responses. Transcript levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF beta were measured and did not change during the migration. These results suggest that loss of immune functions in adult migrating salmon are not due to pathogen infection or cytokine-mediated immune suppression, but is rather part of the life history of Chinook salmon likely induced by diminished energy reserves or hormonal changes which accompany spawning.",0
"A cohabitation challenge model was developed for use in evaluating the efficacy of vaccines developed against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) using a stepwise approach. The study involved identifying a set of input variables that were optimized before inclusion in the model. Input variables identified included the highly virulent Norwegian Sp strain NVI015-TA encoding the T217A221 motif having the ability to cause >90% mortality and a hazard risk ratio of 490.18 (p<0.000) for use as challenge virus. The challenge dose was estimated at 1x10(7) TCID50/mL per fish while the proportion of virus shedders was estimated at 12.5% of the total number of fish per tank. The model was designed based on a three parallel tank system in which the Cox hazard proportional regression model was used to estimate the minimum number of fish required to show significant differences between the vaccinated and control fish in each tank. All input variables were optimized to generate mortality >75% in the unvaccinated fish in order to attain a high discriminatory capacity (DC) between the vaccinated and control fish as a measure of vaccine efficacy. The model shows the importance of using highly susceptible fish to IPNV in the optimization of challenge models by showing that highly susceptible fish had a better DC of differentiating vaccine protected fish from the unvaccinated control fish than the less susceptible fish. Once all input variables were optimized, the model was tested for its reproducibility by generating similar results from three independent cohabitation challenge trials using the same input variables. Overall, data presented here show that the cohabitation challenge model developed in this study is reproducible and that it can reliably be used to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines developed against IPNV in Atlantic salmon. We envision that the approach used here will open new avenues for developing optimal challenge models for use in evaluating the efficacy of different vaccines used in aquaculture.",0
"To understand the effect of low dietary phosphorus (P) intake on the vertebral column of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, a primary P deficiency was induced in post-smolts. The dietary P provision was reduced by 50% for a period of 10 weeks under controlled conditions. The animal's skeleton was subsequently analysed by radiology, histological examination, histochemical detection of minerals in bones and scales and chemical mineral analysis. This is the first account of how a primary P deficiency affects the skeleton in S. salar at the cellular and at the micro-anatomical level. Animals that received the P-deficient diet displayed known signs of P deficiency including reduced growth and soft, pliable opercula. Bone and scale mineral content decreased by c. 50%. On radiographs, vertebral bodies appear small, undersized and with enlarged intervertebral spaces. Contrary to the X-ray-based diagnosis, the histological examination revealed that vertebral bodies had a regular size and regular internal bone structures; intervertebral spaces were not enlarged. Bone matrix formation was continuous and uninterrupted, albeit without traces of mineralization. Likewise, scale growth continues with regular annuli formation, but new scale matrix remains without minerals. The 10 week long experiment generated a homogeneous osteomalacia of vertebral bodies without apparent induction of skeletal malformations. The experiment shows that bone formation and bone mineralization are, to a large degree, independent processes in the fish examined. Therefore, a deficit in mineralization must not be the only cause of the alterations of the vertebral bone structure observed in farmed S. salar. It is discussed how the observed uncoupling of bone formation and mineralization helps to better diagnose, understand and prevent P deficiency-related malformations in farmed S. salar.",0
"Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) are a disease of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) associated with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV). The disease appears mainly during the marine production phase. This study examined if smoltification and transfer to seawater could compromise immune responses to PRV. Parr and smolts of the same origin were challenged by cohabitation with intraperitoneally injected salmon. Peak levels of PRV in spleen of cohabitants were reached after 8 weeks, but at a lower level in parr compared to smolts. Thereafter the virus levels declined, but remained significantly lower in parr than in smolts. Both groups developed typical HSMI histopathological heart lesions, which were most prominent after 10 weeks. Microarray and qPCR analyses revealed slightly lower expression of immune genes in spleen and head kidney of smolts before challenge. Infected parr showed earlier induction of genes involved in innate antiviral immunity, as well as for genes related to B and T cell responses. Gene expression profiles also indicated stimulation of heme and iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in smolts, which may indicate replacement of PRV-infected erythrocytes.",0
"Two forms of selenium (Se) supplementation of fish feeds were compared in two different basal diets. A 12-week feeding trial was performed with rainbow trout fry using either a plant-based or a fish meal-based diet. Se yeast and selenite were used for Se supplementation. Total Se and Se speciation were determined in both diets and whole body of trout fry using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The two selenoamino acids, selenomethionine (SeMet) and selenocysteine (SeCys), were determined in whole body of fry after enzymatic digestion using protease type XIV with a prior derivatization step in the case of SeCys. The plant-based basal diet was found to have a much lower total Se than the fish meal-based basal diet with concentrations of 496 and 1222 mug(Se) kg(-1), respectively. Dietary Se yeast had a higher ability to raise whole body Se compared to selenite. SeMet concentration in the fry was increased only in the case of Se yeast supplementation, whereas SeCys levels were similar at the end of the feeding trial for both Se supplemented forms. The results show that the fate of dietary Se in fry is highly dependent on the form brought through supplementation and that a plant-based diet clearly benefits from Se supplementation.",0
"The main objective of this study was to develop the primary and secondary models to describe the growth kinetics of Salmonella as well as background microorganisms in raw, shucked oysters. Samples, inoculated with a cocktail of two Salmonella serotypes, S. Typhimurium (CICC22956) and S. Enteritidis (CICC21482), were incubated at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 30, 33, 37, 40, and 43 √ÅC. Growth of Salmonella was observed at all temperatures, except at 4 √ÅC. The background microorganisms grew at all temperatures. All growth curves clearly exhibited lag, exponential and stationary phases, and were analyzed using the Huang growth model. Three secondary models (Ratkowsky square-root, Huang square-root, and Cardinal parameter models) were compared for evaluating the effect of temperature on bacterial growth rates. Data analysis was performed using IPMP 2013, a free predictive microbiology software tool developed by the USDA ARS. The Cardinal parameters model underestimated the specific rates of the microorganisms at low temperatures. The Huang square-root model was more suitable than the Ratkowsky square-root model for describing the effect of temperature on growth of Salmonella, while the Ratkowsky square-root model, on the other hand, was more suitable for background microorganisms. For both Salmonella and background microorganisms, the logarithms of the lag phase were expressed as linear functions of the logarithms of specific growth rates. The results of this study can be used by the food retailers and regulatory agencies to estimate the microbial shelf-life of raw, shucked oysters. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Microplastics are increasingly recognized as being widespread in the world's oceans, but relatively little is known about ingestion by marine biota. In light of the potential for microplastic fibers and fragments to be taken up by small marine organisms, we examined plastic ingestion by two foundation species near the base of North Pacific marine food webs, the calanoid copepod Neocalanus cristatus and the euphausiid Euphausia pacifia. We developed an acid digestion method to assess plastic ingestion by individual zooplankton and detected microplastics in both species. Encounter rates resulting from ingestion were 1 particle/every 34 copepods and 1/every 17 euphausiids (euphausiids > copepods; p = 0.01). Consistent with differences in the size selection of food between these two zooplankton species, the ingested particle size was greater in euphausiids (816 +/- 108 mum) than in copepods (556 +/- 149 mum) (p = 0.014). The contribution of ingested microplastic fibres to total plastic decreased with distance from shore in euphausiids (r (2) = 70, p = 0.003), corresponding to patterns in our previous observations of microplastics in seawater samples from the same locations. This first evidence of microplastic ingestion by marine zooplankton indicate that species at lower trophic levels of the marine food web are mistaking plastic for food, which raises fundamental questions about potential risks to higher trophic level species. One concern is risk to salmon: We estimate that consumption of microplastic-containing zooplankton will lead to the ingestion of 2-7 microplastic particles/day by individual juvenile salmon in coastal British Columbia, and </=91 microplastic particles/day in returning adults.",1
"Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) has caused great losses to the Chilean salmon industry, and the success of prevention and treatment strategies is uncertain. The use of RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising approach because during the replication cycle, the ISAV genome must be transcribed to mRNA in the cytoplasm. We explored the capacity of E. coli transformed with plasmids that produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to induce antiviral activity when added to infected ASK cells. We transformed the non-pathogenic Escherichia coli HT115 (DE3) with plasmids that expressed highly conserved regions of the ISAV genes encoding the nucleoprotein (NP), fusion (F), hemagglutinin (HE), and matrix (M) proteins as dsRNA, which is the precursor of the RNAi mechanism. The inactivated transformed bacteria carrying dsRNA were tested for their capacity to silence the target ISAV genes, and the dsRNA that were able to inhibit gene expression were subsequently tested for their ability to attenuate the cytopathic effect (CPE) and reduce the viral load. Of the four target genes tested, inactivated E. coli transformed with plasmids producing dsRNA targeting HE showed antiviral activity when added to infected ASK cells.",0
"Feral animals represent an important problem in many ecosystems due to interbreeding with wild conspecifics. Hybrid offspring from wild and domestic parents are often less adapted to local environment and ultimately, can reduce the fitness of the native population. This problem is an important concern in Norway, where each year, hundreds of thousands of farm Atlantic salmon escape from fish farms. Feral fish outnumber wild populations, leading to a possible loss of local adaptive genetic variation and erosion of genetic structure in wild populations. Studying the genetic factors underlying relative performance between wild and domesticated conspecific can help to better understand how domestication modifies the genetic background of populations, and how it may alter their ability to adapt to the natural environment. Here, based upon a large-scale release of wild, farm and wild x farm salmon crosses into a natural river system, a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) scan was performed on the offspring of 50 full-sib families, for traits related to fitness (length, weight, condition factor and survival). Six QTLs were detected as significant contributors to the phenotypic variation of the first three traits, explaining collectively between 9.8 and 14.8% of the phenotypic variation. The seventh QTL had a significant contribution to the variation in survival, and is regarded as a key factor to understand the fitness variability observed among salmon in the river. Interestingly, strong allelic correlation within one of the QTL regions in farmed salmon might reflect a recent selective sweep due to artificial selection.",1
"The aim of this study was to identify suitable starch sources that can improve the structural integrity of plant protein-based extruded feeds, specifically aquatic feeds. Extrusion trials were performed, using a single-screw extruder. Extruder temperature, screw speed, and moisture content were varied in a factorial design with a replicated central composite point. The effects of these variables on functional and structural properties of the extrudates were evaluated. Temperature had the dominant effect on all properties. Increasing extruder temperature resulted in notable increases in onset temperature of gelatinization and glass transition temperature of all extrudates. The lowest water absorption, alkaline viscosity, and the highest water solubility, in addition to the lowest Rapid Visco Analyzer profile were found for corn starch extrudates. The lowest thermal stability was observed for the potato extrudate. It is expected that cassava and potato starches can contribute better in the formation of a cohesive structure and the generation of more expanded extrudates, specifically in the production of aquafeed. The higher enthalpy transition of corn extrudates indicated the higher thermal stability of corn starch which can lead in production of more durable aquafeed extrudates.

"Information regarding chemical pollutant levels in farmed fish and shellfish, along with the risks associated with their consumption is still scarce. This study was designed to assess levels of exposure to 21 trace elements in fish (Dicentrarchus labrax), mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oysters (Crassostrea gigas) collected from aquaculture marine ecosystems of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Metal concentrations showed great variability in the three species; the highest values of the nonessential elements As and Cd were found in oysters while the highest levels of Al, Pb and V were found in mussels. The essential elements Cu, Mn and Zn were highest in oysters, but Fe, Cr, Ni, Se, Co and Mo levels were highest in mussels. Fish had the lowest concentrations for all trace elements, which were at least one order of magnitude lower than in bivalves. The rare earth elements cerium and lanthanum were found at higher levels in mussels than in oysters, but undetectable in fish. The maximum values set by European regulations for Hg, Cd and Pb were never exceeded in the examined samples. However, comparing the estimated human daily intakes (EHDIs) with the suggested tolerable copper and zinc intakes suggested a potential risk for frequent consumers of oysters. Similarly, people who consume high quantities of mussels could be exposed to concentrations of Al that exceed the proposed TWI (tolerable weekly intake).",1
"Eggshell is considered to be a waste and a significant quantity of eggshell waste is generated from food processing, baking and hatching industries. In this study, the effect of different sulfur/eggshell (w/w) ratios and temperatures was investigated to evaluate the feasibility of the sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification with eggshell (SADE) process for nitrate removal. The results showed eggshell can maintain a neutral condition in a range of pH 7.05-7.74 in the SADE process, and remove 97% of nitrate in synthetic groundwater. Compared with oyster shell and limestone, eggshell was found to be a desirable alkaline material for sulfur-based autotrophic denitrification (SAD) with no nitrite accumulation and insignificant sulfate production. Denitrification reaction was found to follow the first-order kinetic models (R(2) > .9) having nitrate removal rate constants of 0.85 and 0.93 d(-1) for raw eggshell and boiled eggshell, respectively. Sulfur/eggshell ratio of 2:3 provided the best efficiency on nitrate removal. Nitrate was removed completely by the SADE process at a low temperature of 15 degrees C. Eggshell could be used for the SAD process due to its good effect for nitrate removal from groundwater.",0
"BACKGROUND: Neural-endocrine-immune (NEI) system is a major modulation network among the nervous, endocrine and immune system and weights greatly in maintaining homeostasis of organisms during stress and infection. Some microRNAs are found interacting with NEI system (designated NeurimmiRs), addressing swift modulations on immune system. The oyster Crassostrea gigas, as an intertidal bivalve, has evolved a primary NEI system. However, the knowledge about NeurimmiRs in oysters remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Six small RNA libraries from haemocytes of oysters stimulated with acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE) were sequenced to identify neurotransmitter-responsive miRNAs and survey their immunomodulation roles. A total of 331 miRNAs (132 identified in the present study plus 199 identified previously) were subjected to expression analysis, and twenty-one and sixteen of them were found ACh- or NE-responsive, respectively (FDR < 0.05). Meanwhile, 21 miRNAs exhibited different expression pattern after ACh or NE stimulation. Consequently, 355 genes were predicted as putative targets of these neurotransmitter-responsive miRNAs in oyster. Through gene onthology analysis, multiple genes involved in death, immune system process and response to stimulus were annotated to be modulated by NeurimmiRs. Besides, a significant decrease in haemocyte phagocytosis and late-apoptosis or necrosis rate was observed after ACh and NE stimulation (p < 0.05) while early-apoptosis rate remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive immune-related network involving PRRs, intracellular receptors, signaling transducers and immune effectors was proposed to be modulated by ACh- and NE-responsive NeurimmiRs, which would be indispensable for oyster haemocytes to respond against stress and infection. Characterization of the NeurimmiRs would be an essential step to understand the NEI system of invertebrate and the adaptation mechanism of oyster.",0
"Urban effluents are rich in nutrients, organic matter, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, hydrocarbons, surfactants, and others. Previous studies have shown that oysters Crassostrea gigas accumulate significant levels of linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) in sanitary sewage contaminated sites, but there is little information about its toxicological effects in marine bivalves. The aim of this study was to analyze the transcription of genes in two tissues of C. gigas exposed for 12, 24, and 36 h to LABs or sanitary sewage. Likewise, the activity of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes was measured in oysters exposed for 36 h in all groups. Oysters exposed to LABs and oysters exposed to sanitary sewage showed different patterns of transcriptional responses. LAB-exposed oysters showed lower level of biological responses than the oysters exposed to sanitary sewage. Despite the ability of the oyster C. gigas to accumulate LABs (28-fold), the data indicate that these contaminants are not the cause for the transcriptional responses observed in oysters exposed to sanitary sewage. Possibly, the biological changes observed in the sanitary sewage-exposed oysters are associated with the presence of other contaminants, which might have caused synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects. The results show that FABP-like and GST-omega-like messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have a rapid response in tissues of oyster C. gigas exposed to sanitary sewage, suggesting a possible protective response and a role in maintaining homeostasis of these organisms.",0
"The colourless mat covering organically enriched sediments underlying an intensive salmon farm in Estero Pichicolo, southern Chile, was surveyed by combined 454 PyroTag and conventional Sanger sequencing of 16S/18S ribosomal RNA genes for Bacteria and Eukarya. The mat was dominated by the sulphide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) Candidatus Isobeggiatoa, Candidatus Parabeggiatoa and Arcobacter. By order of their abundances, sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were represented by diverse deltaproteobacterial Desulfobacteraceae, but also within Desulfobulbaceae, Desulfuromonadaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae. The eukaryotic PyroTags were dominated by polychaetes, copepods and nematodes, however, ciliated protozoans were highly abundant in microscopy observations, and were represented by the genera Condylostoma, Loxophyllum and Peritromus. Finally, the abundant Sulfurimonas/Sulfurovum also suggest the occurrence of zero-valence sulphur oxidation, probably derived from Beggiatoaceae as a result of bacteriovorus infaunal activity or generated as free S(0) by the Arcobacter bacteria. The survey suggests an intense and complex sulphur cycle within the surface of salmon-farm impacted sediments.",1
"A fast, simple and robust method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of 23 pharmaceuticals (including some major metabolites) in bivalve mollusks. The analytes belong to eight different therapeutic groups: antibiotics, psychiatric drugs, analgesics/anti-inflammatories, tranquilizer, calcium channel blockers, diuretic, and prostatic hyperplasia. The method is based on pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) followed by solid phase extraction clean-up (SPE), and ultra performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPL-MS/MS) for the identification and quantification of the target analytes. It has been developed and validated in three different species of bivalves: Crassostrea gigas (Pacific oyster), Mytilus galloprovincialis (Mediterranean mussel), and Chamelea gallina (striped venus clam). The majority of the compounds were extracted with a recovery between 40 and 115%. The developed analytical method allowed the determination of the compounds in the lower ng/g concentration levels. The relative standard deviation was under 12% for the intra-day and 20% inter-day analyses, respectively. Finally, the method was applied to oyster, clam and mussel samples collected from the Ebro delta, Spain. The most ubiquitous compounds detected were the psychiatric drug venlanfaxine and the antibiotic azithromycin, with the highest concentrations found in mussel (2.7ng/g dw) and oyster (3.0ng/g dw), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that azithromycin has been reported in environmental samples of marine biota.",1
"Salmon was not only an ideal food source to supply nutrient for human, but also had health function. The research progress and development tendency of modified atmosphere packing (MAP) of salmon were introduced. If just adopting modified atmosphere packaging, salmon could be only kept quality in limited days, but if combining MAP with acid leach, salt marsh, smudging, preservative and fungicide, the shelf life of salmon could be prolonged longer, which was the major developing trend of modified atmosphere technology. Modified atmosphere packaging could inhibit the growth of aerobic bacteria. Salmon's specific spoilage organisms (SSO) under modified atmosphere packaging were Photobacterium phosphoreum, lactic acid bacteria and so on. The models created by the growth of spoilage bacteria was used to predict the shelf life of salmon, which was a useful method to establish an accurate and timely food safety risk assessment.",0
"BACKGROUND: Despite calicivirus food-borne outbreaks posing major public health concern worldwide, little information is at present available about the impact of caliciviruses mixed infection in an oyster-associated outbreak in China. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of an oyster-associated calicivirus outbreak initiated by a food festival in Shanghai, China, in April 2014. STUDY DESIGN: Molecular epidemiological studies based on nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of calicivirus strains from patients. RESULTS: A total of 65 of the 78 (83%) cases from this outbreak were associated with raw oyster consumption. Forty-six calicivirus strains were identified from 25 stool specimens with norovirus (NoV) GII.4 Sydney_2012, GII.13, GI.2, GI.5 and sapovirus (SaV) GI.2 being predominant genotypes and with a prevalence of triple-, double- and single-infection being 20%, 48% and 28%, respectively. Meanwhile, 13 putative NoV recombinants were indicated by the phylogenetic inconsistency between capsid and polymerase genotype, mainly including GII.Pe/GII.4 Sydney_2012. Molecular epidemiological investigation showed possible multiple route transmission in the field. The clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of the mixed point-source calicivirus outbreak also conformed to Kaplan's criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported oyster-associated calicivirus outbreak with a high prevalence of mixed infection during a food festival described in China. Our investigation underscores the importance of early surveillance and comprehensive etiologic identification of mixed point-source outbreaks and the need for reliable standards of monitoring oysters to prevent and control calicivirus food-borne outbreaks in China.",0
"This study demonstrates the application of a novel lipid removal product to the residue analysis of 65 pesticides and 52 environmental contaminants in kale, pork, salmon, and avocado by fast, low pressure gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LPGC-MS/MS). Sample preparation involves QuEChERS extraction followed by use of EMR-Lipid (""enhanced matrix removal of lipids"") and an additional salting out step for cleanup. The optimal amount of EMR-Lipid was determined to be 500mg for 2.5mL extracts for most of the analytes. The co-extractive removal efficiency by the EMR-Lipid cleanup step was 83-98% for fatty samples and 79% for kale, including 76% removal of chlorophyll. Matrix effects were typically less than +/-20%, in part because analyte protectants were used in the LPGC-MS/MS analysis. The recoveries of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and diverse pesticides were mostly 70-120%, whereas recoveries of nonpolar polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polychlorinated biphenyls were mostly lower than 70% through the cleanup procedure. With the use of internal standards, method validation results showed that 76-85 of the 117 analytes achieved satisfactory results (recoveries of 70-120% and RSD</=20%) in pork, avocado, and kale, while 53 analytes had satisfactory results in salmon. Detection limits were 5-10ng/g for all but a few analytes. EMR-Lipid is a new sample preparation tool that serves as another useful option for cleanup in multiresidue analysis, particularly of fatty foods.",0
"The multifactorial etiology of massive Crassostrea gigas summer mortalities results from complex interactions between oysters, opportunistic pathogens and environmental factors. In a field survey conducted in 2014 in the Mediterranean Thau Lagoon (France), we evidenced that the development of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, which produces paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), was concomitant with the accumulation of PSTs in oyster flesh and the occurrence of C. gigas mortalities. In order to investigate the possible role of toxic algae in this complex disease, we experimentally infected C. gigas oyster juveniles with Vibrio tasmaniensis strain LGP32, a strain associated with oyster summer mortalities, after oysters were exposed to Alexandrium catenella. Exposure of oysters to A. catenella significantly increased the susceptibility of oysters to V. tasmaniensis LGP32. On the contrary, exposure to the non-toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense or to the haptophyte Tisochrysis lutea used as a foraging alga did not increase susceptibility to V. tasmaniensis LGP32. This study shows for the first time that A. catenella increases the susceptibility of Crassostrea gigas to pathogenic vibrios. Therefore, in addition to complex environmental factors explaining the mass mortalities of bivalve mollusks, feeding on neurotoxic dinoflagellates should now be considered as an environmental factor that potentially increases the severity of oyster mortality events.",0
"The current study was designed to develop an antibody based chromatographic lateral flow detection device (LFD) for rapid identification of Vibrio vulnificus from oyster homogenate. Anti-H monoclonal antibodies against V. vulnificus were prepared and used in the development of the LFD device. The LFD device was tested for its specificity, sensitivity and storage stability. The LFDs were tested against seven different Vibrio spp. along with three different V. vulnificus isolates. All Vibrio except for V. vulnificus failed to produce a visible signal on the device. The LFD was able to detect the presence of V. vulnificus at levels of approximately 4 log CFU/ml from phosphate buffered saline and oyster homogenate without any pre-enrichment process. When combined with 6.66 h enrichment period the LFD was able to detect pathogen counts as low as 10 CFU/ml from oyster homogenate. The storage stability and effects of temperature abuse on the LFD were determined by storing LFD at 4 √ÅC, 25 √ÅC and 40 √ÅC for two weeks. It was found that two weeks storage in extreme temperatures, 4 √ÅC and 40 √ÅC, did not affect the sensitivity of the LFD. The results indicate that LFD were able to identify target pathogens from oyster homogenate accurately and could serve as rapid and sensitive V. vulnificus screening method from oysters with or without enrichment.

"Titanium oxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) have received wide attention in diverse application, but the potential impact of these nanomaterials on the environment, aquatic life and especially on fish cell lines is lacking. The present study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by TiO2 NPs on Chinook salmon cells derived from Oncorhynchus tshawytscha embryos (CHSE-214). The The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] and neutral red (NR) assays in CHSE-214 cells exposed to TiO2 NPs revealed concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect in the range of 10 to 60 mug/ml for 24 h. CHSE-214 cells exposed to TiO2 NPs (10-60 mug/ml) exhibited significant decline in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) glutathione (GSH) content and increased lipid peroxidation (LPO) in a concentration-dependent manner. TiO2 NPs induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in CHSE-214 cells which serve as a base line studies for future studies.",0
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a marine bacterium recognized as an important cause of gastroenteritis in humans consuming contaminated shellfish. In recent years, increasing resistance to ampicillin and aminoglycosides has been observed among V. parahaemolyticus isolates. However, the first-line antimicrobials such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones remained highly effective against these bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of V. parahaemolyticus in live bivalve molluscs available on the Polish market and to determine the antimicrobial resistance of the recovered isolates. A total of 400 shellfish samples (mussels, oysters, clams, and scallops) from 2009 to 2012 were tested using the International Organization for Standardization standard 21872-1 method and PCR for the species-specific toxR gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates was determined using a microbroth dilution method. V. parahaemolyticus was identified in 70 (17.5%) of the 400 samples, and the toxR gene was confirmed in 64 (91.4%) of these isolates. Most of the isolates were recovered from clams (31 isolates; 48.4% prevalence) followed by mussels (17 isolates; 26.6% prevalence). More V. parahaemolyticus-positive samples were found between May and September (22.7% prevalence) than between October and April (11.4% prevalence). Antibiotic profiling revealed that most isolates were resistant to ampicillin (56 isolates; 87.5%) and to streptomycin (45 isolates; 70.3%), but all of them were susceptible to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Forty-one isolates (64.1%) were resistant to two or more antimicrobials; however, only one isolate (1.6%) was resistant to three antimicrobial classes. The antimicrobials used in treatment of human V. parahaemolyticus infection had high efficacy against the bacterial isolates tested. This study is the first concerning antibiotic resistance of V. parahaemolyticus isolates in Poland, and the results obtained indicate that these bacteria may pose a health risk to consumers.",1
"Microbial spoilage of salmon occurs during extended refrigerated storage and is often accompanied by unpleasant aromas. When spoilage is detected, it is assumed that consumers will reject the product for consumption. Because sensory panels of trained individuals or consumers are expensive and labor intensive, identification of microbiological or chemical indicators to characterize the extent to which fish has spoiled is needed when experimental process and storage treatments are being evaluated. A consumer panel of 53 senior citizens (60 to 85 years of age) evaluated in duplicate raw salmon subjected to 10 storage conditions, and the fish quality was targeted to range from fresh to very spoiled. This population group was chosen because they would be expected to have a greater prevalence of olfactory impairments and higher odor thresholds than the general population; in turn, a shorter safety margin or time period between product rejection due to spoilage and the generation of Clostridium botulinum toxins would be likely. Low hedonic scores for aroma and overall acceptance (2 or 3 of 9), corresponding to ""dislike very much"" to ""dislike moderately,"" did not equate with unwillingness to prepare the sample for consumption by up to seven panelists (13%) when the product was presumed to have already been purchased. Despite these outliers, significant models (P = 0.0000) were developed for the willingness of consumers to prepare the sample for consumption and the sample's aerobic and anaerobic microbiological populations and two volatile peaks with Kovats indices of 640 and 753. However, these models revealed that the levels of microbiological and chemical markers must be very high before some consumers would reject the sample; hence, spoilage detection by smell would likely not be an adequate safeguard against consuming salmon in which C. botulinum toxin had been generated.",1
"Ovaprim (OVP), a commercial formulation of a salmon GnRH analogue and the dopamine receptor-2 blocker domperidone, is a successful spawning inducer for fish breeding. It induces a preovulatory surge in LH, which stimulates the synthesis of a maturation-inducing steroid (MIS, 17,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one) that initiates germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and ovulation. Coincidently, the OVP treatment also stimulates vasotocin (VT) secretion in the brain and ovary of the catfish Heteropneustes fossilis that also stimulates the synthesis of the MIS. VT mediates its effect through V1- and V2-type receptors. In the present study in the catfish, we report that OVP stimulates the expression of VT receptor genes v1a1, v1a2 and v2a in the brain and ovary. A single intraperitoneal administration of OVP (0.5muL/g body weight) or incubation of post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles with 5muL/mL OVP, for 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24h stimulated ovulation and GVBD, respectively, in a time-dependent manner. The OVP treatment in vivo stimulated brain VT receptor transcript levels 4h onwards. The peak expression was noticed at 12h (v1a1), 8 and 12h (v1a2), and 8, 12 and 16h (v2a), coinciding with FOM and ovulation. The VT receptor genes are expressed in the ovarian follicles compartmentally; both v1a1 and v1a2 are expressed in the isolated follicular layer (theca and granulosa) but absent in denuded oocytes. V2a is expressed in the denuded oocytes and not in the follicular layer. The OVP injection stimulated the v1a1 and v1a2 expression from 4h onwards in both intact follicle and isolated follicular layer, the peak expression was observed at 16h. The v2a expression was up-regulated in both intact follicles and denuded oocytes at 4h (denuded oocytes) or 8h (intact follicle) onwards with the peak expression at 12h and 16h (denuded oocytes) or at 16h (intact follicles). Under in vitro conditions, the OVP incubations elicited similar pattern of changes with the peak stimulation at 16h for all the genes. In conclusion, the VT receptor genes are differentially expressed in the ovarian follicles and OVP induced periovulatory stimulation of the VT receptor genes, coinciding with FOM and ovulation.",0
"Paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) traditionally have been analyzed by liquid chromatography with either pre- or post-column derivatization and always with a silica-based stationary phase. This technique resulted in different methods that need more than one run to analyze the toxins. Furthermore, tetrodotoxin (TTX) was recently found in bivalves of northward locations in Europe due to climate change, so it is important to analyze it along with PST because their signs of toxicity are similar in the bioassay. The methods described here detail a new approach to eliminate different runs, by using a new porous graphitic carbon stationary phase. Firstly we describe the separation of 13 PST that belong to different groups, taking into account the side-chains of substituents, in one single run of less than 30 min with good reproducibility. The method was assayed in four shellfish matrices: mussel (Mytillus galloprovincialis), clam (Pecten maximus), scallop (Ruditapes decussatus) and oyster (Ostrea edulis). The results for all of the parameters studied are provided, and the detection limits for the majority of toxins were improved with regard to previous liquid chromatography methods: the lowest values were those for decarbamoyl-gonyautoxin 2 (dcGTX2) and gonyautoxin 2 (GTX2) in mussel (0.0001 mg saxitoxin (STX).diHCl kg(-1) for each toxin), decarbamoyl-saxitoxin (dcSTX) in clam (0.0003 mg STX.diHCl kg(-1)), N-sulfocarbamoyl-gonyautoxins 2 and 3 (C1 and C2) in scallop (0.0001 mg STX.diHCl kg(-1) for each toxin) and dcSTX (0.0003 mg STX.diHCl kg(-1) ) in oyster; gonyautoxin 2 (GTX2) showed the highest limit of detection in oyster (0.0366 mg STX.diHCl kg(-1)). Secondly, we propose a modification of the method for the simultaneous analysis of PST and TTX, with some minor changes in the solvent gradient, although the detection limit for TTX does not allow its use nowadays for regulatory purposes.",0
"High levels of the flame retardant 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 47) have been detected in Pacific salmon sampled near urban areas, raising concern over the safety of salmon consumption. However, salmon fillets also contain the antioxidants eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), whose oxidation products induce cellular antioxidant responses. Because oxidative stress is a mechanism of BDE 47 toxicity, we hypothesized that oxidized EPA and DHA can ameliorate the cellular and mitochondrial toxicity of BDE 47. HepG2 cells were treated with a mixture of oxidized EPA and DHA (oxEPA/oxDHA) at a ratio relevant to salmon consumption (1.5/1 oxEPA/oxDHA) followed by exposure to 100 muM BDE 47. Pretreatment with oxEPA/oxDHA for 12 h prior to BDE 47 exposure prevented BDE 47-mediated depletion of glutathione, and increased expression of antioxidant response genes. oxEPA/oxDHA also reduced the level of reactive oxygen species production by BDE 47. The oxEPA/oxDHA antioxidant responses were associated with partial protection against BDE 47-induced loss of viability and also mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial electron transport system functional analysis revealed extensive inhibition of State 3 respiration and maximum respiratory capacity by BDE 47 were partially reversed by oxEPA/oxDHA. Our findings indicate that the antioxidant effects of oxEPA/oxDHA protect against short exposures to BDE 47, including a protective role of these compounds on maintaining cellular and mitochondrial function.",1
"The persistence and stability of the oral administered anti salmon-lice drugs teflubenzuron and diflubenzuron were tested when associated to organic material as faecal particles from Atlantic salmon and medicated food pellets. This laboratory study was performed in seawater under aerobic conditions, at 7 degrees C in the dark and showed that both compounds were remarkably persistent and stable since no significant reduction in the concentrations of flubenzurons in sediment were seen after 24 weeks. Therefore neither chemical or microbial degradation nor outwashing seems to be important pathways for these drugs to disappear from sediment under fish farms. Thus, it is more likely that the decrease of flubenzurons from marine sediments described in field investigations is caused by either bioturbation, resuspension of organic particles or a combination of these.",0
"This study examined the adverse effects of feed-delivered melamine (MEL) and cyanuric acid (CYA) in red tilapia. Diet 1 (without MEL and CYA), diets 2-4 (with MEL and CYA at 2.5, 5 and 7.5 g kg(-1) diet, respectively) and diets 5 and 6 (with either MEL or CYA at 10 g kg(-1) diet) were examined. MEL alone lowered both growth and FCR (P < 0.05), and CYA alone reduced the FCR of tilapia. Protein efficiency ratio and apparent net utilization of fish on diets 2-6 were poor (P < 0.05). The renal tubules of fish ingested MEL-CYA combination had melamine-cyanurate crystals. On the other hand, diets with only one chemical did not induce such crystals. MEL and CYA in whole body, fillet or viscera reflected their dietary inclusion levels. The levels of Hsp70 were increased in the liver of fish that ingested MEL and CYA, in combination or singly (P < 0.05). However, in the kidney, such an increase was visible only in the fish that received diet 4 (P < 0.05). Combination of MEL and CYA at inclusion levels > 5 g kg(-1) diet induced the activity of catalase in liver and the activity of glutathione peroxidase in liver and kidneys. Therefore, these adulterants should not be included in fish feeds.",0
"Introduction of vegetable ingredients in fish feed has affected the fatty acid composition in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L). Here we investigated how changes in fish feed affected the metabolism of mice fed diets containing fillets from such farmed salmon. We demonstrate that replacement of fish oil with rapeseed oil or soybean oil in fish feed had distinct spillover effects in mice fed western diets containing the salmon. A reduced ratio of n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in the fish feed, reflected in the salmon, and hence also in the mice diets, led to a selectively increased abundance of arachidonic acid in the phospholipid pool in the livers of the mice. This was accompanied by increased levels of hepatic ceramides and arachidonic acid-derived pro-inflammatory mediators and a reduced abundance of oxylipins derived from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. These changes were associated with increased whole body insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Our data suggest that an increased ratio between n-6 and n-3-derived oxylipins may underlie the observed marked metabolic differences between mice fed the different types of farmed salmon. These findings underpin the need for carefully considering the type of oil used for feed production in relation to salmon farming.",1
"Diel-cycling hypoxia is widespread in shallow portions of estuaries and lagoons, especially in systems with high nutrient loads resulting from human activities. Far less is known about the effects of this form of hypoxia than deeper-water seasonal or persistent low dissolved oxygen. We examined field patterns of diel-cycling hypoxia and used field and laboratory experiments to test its effects on acquisition and progression of Perkinsus marinus infections in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, as well as on oyster growth and filtration. P. marinus infections cause the disease known as Dermo, have been responsible for declines in oyster populations, and have limited success of oyster restoration efforts. The severity of diel-cycling hypoxia varied among shallow monitored sites in Chesapeake Bay, and average daily minimum dissolved oxygen was positively correlated with average daily minimum pH. In both field and laboratory experiments, diel-cycling hypoxia increased acquisition and progression of infections, with stronger results found for younger (1-year-old) than older (2-3-year-old) oysters, and more pronounced effects on both infections and growth found in the field than in the laboratory. Filtration by oysters was reduced during brief periods of exposure to severe hypoxia. This should have reduced exposure to waterborne P. marinus, and contributed to the negative relationship found between hypoxia frequency and oyster growth. Negative effects of hypoxia on the host immune response is, therefore, the likely mechanism leading to elevated infections in oysters exposed to hypoxia relative to control treatments. Because there is considerable spatial variation in the frequency and severity of hypoxia, diel-cycling hypoxia may contribute to landscape-level spatial variation in disease dynamics within and among estuarine systems.",0
"The impact that the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) has on the immune response of Salmo salar, from the perspective of activating/inactivating cellular processes, is currently unknown. Therefore, the present study evaluated this interaction and found that SHK-1 cells infected with ISAV resulted in respiratory burst activation and the induction of a strong pro-apoptotic imbalance through an increased expression of the Bad protein and decreased transcripts of Bcl-xl. Interestingly, the pharmacological inhibition of the p38 MAPK protein through SB203580 blocked the production of reactive oxygen species, the activity of caspase 3, and the formation of apoptotic nuclei in SHK-1 cells. Additionally, when the NADPH oxidase complex, a producer of superoxide anions, was blocked through apocynin, decreased apoptotic activity was observed in infected cells without significant modifications to viral amplification. These results, together with bioinformatics analysis performed for the Bad gene of fugu, suggest that the ISA virus triggers a strong production of oxygen radicals capable of activating transduction signaling pathways and mediating the expression and activation of pro-apoptotic proteins through the p38 MAPK pathway, all of which results in the apoptosis of ISAV infected cells.",0
"Intensive fish culture in open sea pens delivers large amounts of nutrients to coastal environments. Relative to particulate waste impacts, the ecological impacts of dissolved wastes are poorly known despite their potential to substantially affect nutrient-assimilating components of surrounding ecosystems. Broad-scale enrichment effects of salmonid farms on Tasmanian reef communities were assessed by comparing macroalgal cover at four fixed distances from active fish farm leases across 44 sites. Macroalgal assemblages differed significantly between sites immediately adjacent (100m) to fish farms and reference sites at 5km distance, while sites at 400m and 1km exhibited intermediate characteristics. Epiphyte cover varied consistently with fish farm impacts in both sheltered and exposed locations. The green algae Chaetomorpha spp. predominated near fish farms at swell-exposed sites, whereas filamentous green algae showed elevated densities near sheltered farms. Cover of canopy-forming perennial algae appeared unaffected by fish farm impacts.",1
"Early life is believed to be a critical stage for determining survivorship in all fish. Many studies have suggested that environmental conditions in the ocean determine the fry-to-adult survival rate of Pacific salmon but few investigations have been conducted on the importance of the brief freshwater period during the seaward migration on overall survivorship. Here, we found that most of the variation in survivorship of hatchery-reared chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) was explained by river temperature during the fry stage, despite spending most of their life (approx. 99%) at sea. After the annual release of a constant number of fry, the number of fry moving through the river at a downstream location varied greatly. The number of returning adults was positively correlated with the number of fry moving downstream. This result suggests that most salmon mortality occurred prior to ocean entry, and that short-term mortality in the river is a key factor determining major fluctuations in total mortality. Although marine mortality is often invoked in the literature as a key factor determining total mortality of chum salmon, attention should also be paid to freshwater mortality to understand the population dynamics of this species.",0
"In this paper dried oysters soft tissue was used as raw materials; the amino iminodiacetic acid chelating resin was used as the main body in the ion exchange method to remove the heavy metals. The ICP and automatic amino acid analyzer were used to determine the content of heavy metals and amino acids before and after removing. The results showed that the three heavy metals not exceeded standard except arsenic. The content of Cd had the highest removal efficiency up to 86.49%, and amino acids decreased, the taurine content increased by 15.8%, up to 35244.50 ng/mL.",0
"Due to potential use in aquacultured fish products, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has identified residue testing for steroids as a priority. These compounds are used in aquaculture primarily to direct sexual differentiation with both androgens and estrogens applied depending on the desired outcome. Published research is lacking with respect to steroid residue testing in fish; however, recent studies in other matrixes provided transferable cleanup techniques. A simple, rapid, and sensitive method was developed and validated for use in monitoring aquacultured fish products for the presence of methyltestosterone, nandrolone, epi-nandrolone, boldenone, and epi-boldenone residues. The developed method consists of solvent extraction followed by cleanup using hexane and dual cartridge SPE with analysis by ultra-HPLC-MS/MS. The method is capable of detecting and confirming steroid residue levels ranging from 0.05 to 25 ng/g in salmon and tilapia, depending on the analyte. Recoveries ranged from 88 to 130% for the analytes. Instrument repeatability was less than 13% for all compounds, while intermediate precision ranged from 5 to 25% RSD. HorRat values were within acceptable ranges.",0
"Emerging fungal and oomycete pathogens are increasingly threatening animals and plants globally. Amongst oomycetes, Saprolegnia species adversely affect wild and cultivated populations of amphibians and fish, leading to substantial reductions in biodiversity and food productivity. With the ban of several chemical control measures, new sustainable methods are needed to mitigate Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture. Here, PhyloChip-based community analyses showed that the Pseudomonadales, particularly Pseudomonas species, represent one of the largest bacterial orders associated with salmon eggs from a commercial hatchery. Among the Pseudomonas species isolated from salmon eggs, significantly more biosurfactant producers were retrieved from healthy salmon eggs than from Saprolegnia-infected eggs. Subsequent in vivo activity bioassays showed that Pseudomonas isolate H6 significantly reduced salmon egg mortality caused by Saprolegnia diclina. Live colony mass spectrometry showed that strain H6 produces a viscosin-like lipopeptide surfactant. This biosurfactant inhibited growth of Saprolegnia in vitro, but no significant protection of salmon eggs against Saprolegniosis was observed. These results indicate that live inocula of aquatic Pseudomonas strains, instead of their bioactive compound, can provide new (micro)biological and sustainable means to mitigate oomycete diseases in aquaculture.",0
"The carry-over of certain feed components into animal products can be of concern for human health. The safety assessment of chemical contaminants including natural toxins, agrochemicals, veterinary drugs, and environmental pollutants is a key element of the ""farm-to-fork"" (""One Health"") approach. The transmissibility of proteinaceous feed constituents such as enzymes, proteins from genetically engineered crops, and infectious prions in animal meal has also become of interest; but the transfer of proteins with allergic potential is little studied. In the present study, an exploratory zebrafish feeding trial using feed containing 20 percent of processed larvae of the marine fish parasite Anisakis simplex was performed as a proof-of-principle experiment. After a 2-week exposure period, anisakid peptides were detected in zebrafish tissue by high-resolution liquid-chromatography Orbitrap mass spectrometry and immunostaining using specific polyclonal antibodies or sera from patients with confirmed allergy to A. simplex. Since fishmeal produced from marine pelagic fish is an important feed component in the culture of Atlantic salmon and in the poultry industry, it should be considered as a source of potentially allergenic peptides in the final products. Furthermore, the substitution of fishmeal with plant proteins would not eliminate the potential health risk by allergen carry-over since crops of high nutritional value such as legumes also contain important food allergens. If our preliminary results from the present zebrafish feeding trial should be confirmed in necessary follow-up experiments, the question of labeling information on fish and animal food products raised on feed containing potentially allergenic ingredients could arise in order to minimize the exposure risk of allergic consumers.

"Microbiota can have positive and negative effects on hosts depending on the environmental conditions. Therefore, it is important to decipher host-microbiota-environment interactions, especially under natural conditions exerting (a)biotic stress. Here, we assess the relative importance of microbiota in different tissues of Pacific oyster for its successful establishment in a new environment. We transplanted oysters from the Southern to the Northern Wadden Sea and controlled for the effects of resident microbiota by administering antibiotics to half of the oysters. We then followed survival and composition of haemolymph, mantle, gill and gut microbiota in local and translocated oysters over 5 days. High mortality was recorded only in non-antibiotic-treated translocated oysters, where high titres of active Vibrio sp. in solid tissues indicated systemic infections. Network analyses revealed the highest connectivity and a link to seawater communities in the haemolymph microbiota. Since antibiotics decreased modularity and increased connectivity of the haemolymph-based networks, we propose that community destabilization in non-treated translocated oysters could be attributed to interactions between resident and external microbiota, which in turn facilitated passage of vibrios into solid tissues and invoked disease. These interactions of haemolymph microbiota with the external and internal environment may thus represent an important component of oyster fitness.",0
"Many neurological disorders are initiated by blood-brain barrier breakdown, which potentiates spinal neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Peripheral neuropathic injuries are known to disrupt the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) and to potentiate inflammation. But, it is not known whether BSCB breakdown facilitates pain development. In this study, a neural compression model in the rat was used to evaluate relationships among BSCB permeability, inflammation and pain-related behaviors. BSCB permeability increases transiently only after injury that induces mechanical hyperalgesia, which correlates with serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-7, IL-12, IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha. Mammalian thrombin dually regulates vascular permeability through PAR1 and activated protein C (APC). Since thrombin protects vascular integrity through APC, directing its affinity towards protein C, while still promoting coagulation, might be an ideal treatment for BSCB-disrupting disorders. Salmon thrombin, which prevents the development of mechanical allodynia, also prevents BSCB breakdown after neural injury and actively inhibits TNF-alpha-induced endothelial permeability in vitro, which is not evident the case for human thrombin. Salmon thrombin's production of APC faster than human thrombin is confirmed using a fluorogenic assay and APC is shown to inhibit BSCB breakdown and pain-related behaviors similar to salmon thrombin. Together, these studies highlight the impact of BSCB on pain and establish salmon thrombin as an effective blocker of BSCB, and resulting nociception, through its preferential affinity for protein C.",0
"In this work, parasites associated with the mangrove oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae were studied at a cultivation unit in the estuary of the Graciosa River in Taperoa, Bahia. On a monthly basis, between April 2011 and March 2012, 20 oysters were collected, measured and fixed in 10% formaldehyde. In order to identify the parasites, routine histological techniques were used. The specimens were embedded in paraffin and sections, 7 microm thick, were cut. These were then stained with Harris hematoxylin and eosin and were examined using an optical microscope. The parameters analyzed to investigate water quality showed that the temperature ranged from 23.9 degrees C to 29.3 degrees C, water salinity from 0.4 to 24.2 Practical Salinity Units PSU and recorded rainfall from 80 mm to 406.4 mm/month. During the parasitological analyses, infestation of the polychaete Neanthes succinea was observed in 41% of the oysters. Through histological techniques, the following parasites were identified: colonies of Rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs); the protozoa Nematopsis sp. and Ancistrocoma sp.; the turbellarian Urastoma sp.; the metacestode Tylocephalum sp. and an unidentified tapeworm. The data collected showed that there was low-intensity infection with and prevalence of parasites, except for Nematopsis sp., thus attesting that these cultivated oysters were in a healthy condition.",0
"In the Great Lakes, introduced Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) can transport persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), to new environments during their spawning migrations. To explore the nature and extent of POP biotransport by salmon, we compared 58 PCB and 6 PBDE congeners found in spawning salmon directly to those in resident stream fish. We hypothesized that stream fish exposed to salmon spawners would have congener patterns similar to those of salmon, the presumed contaminant source. Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), we found that POP congener patterns of Pacific salmon varied among regions in the Great Lakes basin (i.e., Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, or Lake Superior), tissue type (whole fish or eggs), and contaminant type (PCB or PBDE). For stream-resident fish, POP congener pattern was influenced by the presence of salmon, location (i.e., Great Lakes Basin), and species identity (i.e., brook trout [Salvelinus fontinalis] or mottled sculpin [Cottus bairdii]). Similarity in congener patterns indicated that salmon are a source of POPs to brook trout in stream reaches receiving salmon spawners from Lake Michigan and Lake Huron but not from Lake Superior. Congener patterns of mottled sculpin differed from those of brook trout and salmon, suggesting that brook trout and mottled sculpin either use salmon tissue to differing degrees, acquire POPs from different dietary sources, or bioaccumulate or metabolize POPs differently. Overall, our analyses identified the important role of salmon in contaminant biotransport but also demonstrated that the extent of salmon-mediated POP transfer and uptake in Great Lakes tributaries is location- and species-specific.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Respiratory outcomes and work-related factors were studied in two seafood worker populations representing different occupational environments. METHODS: Levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), spirometric values, prevalence of respiratory symptoms, and self-evaluated exposures were compared between 139 Norwegian salmon workers and 127 Russian trawler workers. RESULTS: Increased odds ratios (ORs) of shortness of breath with wheezing and prolonged cough as general respiratory symptoms were found in salmon workers, while increased ORs of work-related dry cough and running nose were found in trawler fishermen. Both worker groups ranked ""cold work environment,"" ""use of disinfectants,"" and ""contaminated indoor air"" as the first, second, and third most important causes of work-related respiratory symptoms, respectively. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels were higher in asthmatic trawler workers compared to asthmatic salmon workers. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory symptoms commonly associated with obstructive airway diseases were more prevalent in salmon workers, while symptoms commonly associated with asthma and short-term effects of cold air exposure were more prevalent in trawler workers.",0
"The contaminated oysters discovered in the Pearl River Estuary (Guangdong province, China) contained high levels of metals in their tissues, especially Cu and Zn, indicating that this large and densely urbanized estuary in Southern China suffers from serious metal pollution. The present study aimed to investigate the impacts of multimetal pollution in the Pearl River Estuary on oyster antioxidant and detoxification systems. The responses of various biochemical biomarkers in the ecologically important oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis collected from 7 sites in the Pearl River Estuary were quantified. Significant correlations were demonstrated between the accumulation of Cu and Zn and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation) and oxidative stress defenses (catalase, glutathione peroxidase) in the oyster gills. Significant correlations between the accumulation of Cd and Cu and detoxification (glutathione and glutathione transferase) in the gills were also documented. Interestingly, metallothionein concentrations were positively correlated with Cd, but negatively correlated with Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations in the gills. These measurements indicated that Cu in the Pearl River Estuary induced various biochemical responses in the oysters and influenced the susceptibility of oysters to environmental stress. The present study has provided the first evidence of antioxidant and detoxification responses in native contaminated oysters from a field environment seriously contaminated by metals. Coupling biomarkers with tissue metal concentration measurements was a promising approach to identify the metals causing biological impacts in a multimetal-contaminated estuary.

"The pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis produces a systemic aggressive infection that involves several organs and tissues in salmonids. In spite of the great economic losses caused by this pathogen in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) industry, very little is known about the resistance mechanisms of the host to this pathogen. In this paper, for the first time, we aimed to identify the bacterial load in head kidney and muscle of Atlantic salmon exhibiting differential familiar mortality. Furthermore, in order to assess the patterns of gene expression of immune related genes in susceptible and resistant families, a set of candidate genes was evaluated using deep sequencing of the transcriptome. The results showed that the bacterial load was significantly lower in resistant fish, when compared with the susceptible individuals. Based on the candidate genes analysis, we infer that the resistant hosts triggered up-regulation of specific genes (such as for example the LysC), which may explain a decrease in the bacterial load in head kidney, while the susceptible fish presented an exacerbated innate response, which is unable to exert an effective response against the bacteria. Interestingly, we found a higher bacterial load in muscle when compared with head kidney. We argue that this is possible due to the availability of an additional source of iron in muscle. Besides, the results show that the resistant fish could not be a likely reservoir of the bacteria.",0
"Objective. To investigate the contamination and health risks of heavy metals in edible marine shellfishes from China. Methods. Statistical characteristics of the concentrations of six metals, i.e., Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, As and Hg, in the edible shellfishes from China offshore waters were investigated, and their health risks were assessed using the target hazard quotient model recommended by US EPA, based on the available information regarding the metal concentrations reported in published literatures. Results. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that all the six metals had skewed concentration distributions.The average contents of Pb, Cd, Cr, As and Hg did not exceed the food standards. In this study, several independent samples tests showed that the concentrations of As, Cu and Cd were significantly different (P > 0.05) among oyster, short necked clam, razor clam and mussel. In these four shellfishes, oyster had the highest levels of Cu and Cd, and razor clam had the highest level of As. No significant differences were observed for other three metals. In the Pearl River Estuary, Fujian coastal waters, the Yangtze River estuary-Zhejiang coastal waters, Shandong coastal waters and Bohai Bay, the non-carcinogenic risk levels from exposure to individual shellfish metal (including Cu, Pb, Cr, and Hg) were separately acceptable. However, the health risks from exposure to Cd in some shellfishes from Fujian coastal waters, Shandong coastal waters and Bohai Bay, and from exposure to As in some shellfishes from Fujian coastal waters, exceeded the acceptable levels. Although the health risk levels from exposure to multiple metals in shellfishes from Fujian coastal waters, Shandong coastal waters and Bohai Bay were unacceptable for children, the non-carcinogenic risks from six metals in other waters were within the safe level. The findings suggested that Cd and As were the key contributors to health risk from exposure to shellfish metals. Conclusion. In China coastal waters, the concentrations of Cu, Cd and Cr in someshellfishes exceeded the food standard. The health risks from Cd and As were unacceptable in some shellfishes in some area, respectively.In this study, no serious heavy metal pollutions were found in the edible marine shellfishes, but the risk of multiple metals exposure in the shellfishes should be of concern.",0
"We present a case of a 40-year-old man with decompensated alcoholic liver cirrhosis presenting with atraumatic cellulitis of one extremity and severe sepsis that rapidly progressed to compartment syndrome despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. Local cultures following debridement revealed Vibrio vulnificus, and subsequent history revealed consumption of raw oysters 48 h before presentation. Our case points out the unique susceptibility of those with cirrhosis and elevated iron saturation to Vibrio septicaemia, as well as the rapidity and severity of the disease progression.",0
"Pentapeptides have been shown to bind the synthetic heparin fondaparinux (Arixtra) as well the biological heparins dalteparin (Fragmin) and salmon heparin. In contrast to heparin binding consensus sequences, the pentapeptides are acidic or neutral, with no arginine or histidine residue. The peptides showed an effect on in vitro heparin anti-factor X activity with a reduction of fondaparinux activity by 65-95%. Heparin binding was further studied by using peptide solid phase chromatography and NMR analysis.",0
"Phthalates have detrimental effects on health and have been shown to dysregulate the immune system of mammals, birds, and fish. We recently reported that di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate exposure reduces the abundance and inhibits the proliferation of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) IgM(+) B lymphocytes and expression of secreted immunoglobulin heavy-chain mu transcripts in an in vitro culture system. We proposed that phthalates act as immunomodulators by modifying the normal B cell-activation pathways by accelerating B cell differentiation while suppressing plasmablast expansion, thus resulting in fewer IgM-secreting plasma cells. This hypothesis was tested here in an in vivo field study of juvenile Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) from a plastic-polluted lake in the Gulf of Alaska. Fish tissues were analyzed for both phthalate levels using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry and for changes in immune gene expression using reverse transcriptase-real time polymerase chain reaction. Results showed that fish with higher tissue levels of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di(n-butyl) phthalate, and/or dimethyl phthalate expressed significantly fewer secreted and membrane-bound immunoglobulin heavy-chain mu and Blimp1 transcripts in their hematopoietic tissue. This suggests that in vivo uptake of phthalates in fish changes the expression of B cell-specific genes. Chronic exposure to phthalates likely dysregulates normal B-lymphoid development and antibody responses in salmonids and may increase susceptibility to infection. Given the conserved nature of B-lineage cells in vertebrate animals, other marine species may be similarly affected by chronic phthalate exposure.",0
"Cadmium (Cd) and elevated temperatures are common stressors in estuarine and coastal environments. Elevated temperature can sensitize estuarine organisms to the toxicity of metals such as Cd and vice versa, but the physiological mechanisms of temperature-Cd interactions are not well understood. We tested a hypothesis that interactive effects of elevated temperature and Cd stress involve Cd-induced reduction of the aerobic scope of an organism thereby narrowing the thermal tolerance window of oysters. We determined the effects of prolonged Cd exposure (50 mug Cd l(-1)for 30 days) on the upper critical temperature of aerobic metabolism (assessed by accumulation of anaerobic end products L-alanine, succinate and acetate), cellular energy status (assessed by the tissue levels of adenylates, phosphagen/aphosphagen and glycogen and lipid reserves) and oxidative damage during acute temperature rise (20-36 degrees C) in the eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. The upper critical temperature (TcII) was shifted to lower values (from 28 to 24 degrees C) in Cd-exposed oysters in spring and was lower in both control and Cd-exposed groups in winter (24 and <20 degrees C, respectively). This indicates a reduction of thermal tolerance of Cd-exposed oysters associated with a decrease of the aerobic scope of the organism and early transition to partial anaerobiosis. Acute warming had no negative effects on tissue energy reserves or parameters of cellular energy status of oysters (except a decrease in adenylate content at the extreme temperature of 36 degrees C) but led to an increase in oxidative lesions of proteins at extreme temperatures. These data show that transition to partial anaerobiosis (indicated by the accumulation of anaerobic end products) is the most sensitive biomarker of temperature-induced transition to energetically non-sustainable state in oysters, whereas disturbances in the cellular energy status (i.e. decline in adenylate and phosphagen levels) and oxidative stress ensue at considerably higher temperatures, nearing the lethal range. This study indicates that long-term exposure of oysters to environmentally relevant levels of Cd may increase their sensitivity to elevated temperatures during seasonal warming and/or the global climate change in polluted estuaries.",0
"BACKGROUND: Sockeye Salmon are an iconic species widely distributed throughout the North Pacific. A devastating pathogen of Sockeye Salmon is infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV, genus Novirhabdovirus, family Rhabdoviridae). It has been postulated that IHNV is maintained in salmon populations by persisting over the life of its host and/or by residing in natural reservoirs other than its susceptible hosts. Herein we demonstrate the presence of IHNV in the brain of Sockeye Salmon that survived an experimentally-induced outbreak, suggesting the presence of viral persistence in this susceptible species. To understand the viral persistent state in Sockeye Salmon we profiled the transcriptome to evaluate the host response in asymptomatic carriers and to determine what effects (if any) IHNV exposure may have on subsequent virus challenges. RESULTS: A laboratory disease model to simulate a natural IHNV outbreak in Sockeye Salmon resulted in over a third of the population incurring acute IHN disease and mortality during the first four months after initial exposure. Nine months post IHNV exposure, despite the absence of disease and mortality, a small percentage (<4 %) of the surviving population contained IHNV in brain. Transcriptome analysis in brain of asymptomatic virus carriers and survivors without virus exhibited distinct transcriptional profiles in comparison to naive fish. Characteristic for carriers was the up-regulation of genes involved in antibody production and antigen presentation. In both carriers and survivors a down-regulation of genes related to cholesterol biosynthesis, resembling an antiviral mechanism observed in higher vertebrates was revealed along with differences in nervous system development. Moreover, following challenge with poly(I:C), survivors and carriers displayed an elevated antiviral immune response in comparison to naive fish. CONCLUSIONS: IHN virus persistence was identified in Sockeye Salmon where it elicited a unique brain transcriptome profile suggesting an ongoing adaptive immune response. IHNV carriers remained uncompromised in mounting efficient innate antiviral responses when exposed to a viral mimic. The capacity of IHNV to reside in asymptomatic hosts supports a virus carrier hypothesis and if proven infectious, could have significant epidemiological consequences towards maintaining and spreading IHNV among susceptible host populations.",0
"Amoebic gill disease (AGD) caused by the ectoparasite Paramoeba perurans affects several cultured marine fish species worldwide. In this study, the morphology and ultrastructure of P. perurans in vitro and in vivo was investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively). Amoebae cultures contained several different morphologies ranging from a distinct rounded cell structure and polymorphic cells with pseudopodia of different lengths and shapes. SEM studies of the gills of AGD-affected Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., revealed the presence of enlarged swellings in affected gill filaments and fusion of adjacent lamellae. Spherical amoebae appeared to embed within the epithelium, and subsequently leave hemispherical indentations with visible fenestrations in the basolateral surface following their departure. These fenestrated structures corresponded to the presence of pseudopodia which could be seen by TEM to penetrate into the epithelium. The membrane-membrane interface contained an amorphous and slightly fibrous matrix. This suggests the existence of cellular glycocalyces and a role for extracellular products in mediating pathological changes in amoebic gill disease.",0
"In this work, efficient methods to determine Cu in bovine liver, fish tissue, and rolled oats by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF AAS), after fast alkaline solubilisation of the samples with Universol (a new reagent for sample solubilisation, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide in 40 % v/v of water), were presented. The optimum modifiers were permanent Ir (500 mug) plus co-injection of Ru (5 mug) for bovine liver, permanent Nb (500 mug) for salmon, and permanent Ir (500 mug) with co-injection of Pt (5 mug) for rolled oats. The optimum pyrolysis (PT) and atomization temperatures (AT) (obtained by pyrolysis and atomization curves) were of PT of 1300 √ÅC for all matrices, and AT of 1800 √ÅC for bovine liver and 2300 √ÅC for salmon and rolled oats. Aqueous and matrix matching calibration curves (n = 3 curves for each calibration), had average angular coefficients that were not statistically different, i.e. matrix effect was absent for both matrices then the calibration for the three matrices was accomplished with aqueous calibration. The accuracy was checked with six certified materials for bovine liver; four for salmon and two for rolled oats. In all cases, obtained values were in agreement with the certified one. The characteristic masses were of 8.0, 6.4, and 7.8 for bovine liver, salmon and rolled oats, respectively (recommended mass of 10 pg). The LOD and LOQ were of 1.8 and 6.0 mug g-1 for bovine liver, 2.0 and 6.6 mug g-1 for salmon and 1.4 and 4.6 mug g-1 for rolled oats. As the solubilisation is very fast, the methods can be used to determine Cu (and most probably other metals) with simple sample preparation, good accuracy and precision.

"The objective of this study is to evaluate the antilisterial effect of Pediococcus pentosaceus T1, which was isolated from kimchi, and to assess its potential for extending the shelf life of salmon and kimchi. Pediococcus pentosaceus T1 culture effectively inhibited proliferation of Listeria monocytogenes in a dose-dependent manner in a salmon-based medium. Antilisterial effect of the culture was stronger than that of nisin, an antibacterial peptide, as evidenced by lower minimum inhibitory concentration value (20 mg/mL) compared to nisin (over 20 mg/mL). P. pentosaceus T1 culture also effectively inhibited the growth of Listeriain salmon fillet. In particular, the culture (6 g per 100 mL) showed a stronger inhibitory effect than sodium hypochlorite (0.2 mg/mL), a disinfectant used in food processing. In kimchi fermentation, the treatment with P. pentosaceus T1 culture suppressed changes of acidity and pH during maturation. The inhibitory effect of the culture on kimchi lactic acid bacteria, which include Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus sakei, led to a drastic decrease in maturation rates of kimchi. Moreover, sensory test on kimchi treated with P. pentosaceus T1 showed that the culture improved overall acceptability of kimchi, which can be observed in higher scores of sourness, texture, off-flavour and mouthfeel compared with untreated kimchi. The results of this study suggest that kimchi-derived P. pentosaceus T1 could be a potential antilisterial agent in fish products as well as a starter to control overmaturation of kimchi.",0
"This study investigated the potential of using hyperspectral imaging technology (900-1700 nm) to determine the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value and pH for evaluation of lipid oxidation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fillets during cold storage for 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 days at 1 1 √ÅC. Good results were achieved for both parameters by using partial least square regression (PLSR) calibration models with full spectral region. Two simplified models were then built by using forward stepwise-multiple linear regression (MLR) variable selection method to select 18 and 10 most important wavelengths for TBA value and pH, respectively. The optimised stepwise-MLR model for TBA value yielded satisfactory results with correlation coefficient (rC) of 0.921 and root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) of 1.840 mumol MDA/kg fish. This model was used to visualise the TBA value distributions during different storage days. Further improvements were achieved by applying particle analysis on the images to extract only the spectra from white stripes in salmon fillet. When in tandem with detrend pre-processing technique, the calibration model based on particle analysis demonstrated the best performance for TBA value prediction (rC= 0.957 and RMSEC = 1.449 mumol MDA/kg). In addition, a novel chemometric strategy accomplished by the use of hyperspectrograms was also proposed in this work and satisfactory results were obtained. The overall results confirmed the capability of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging as a rapid and non-invasive technique to monitor lipid oxidation in salmon fillets.

"BACKGROUND: The Janus kinase (Jak) and signaling transducer activator of transcription (Stat) pathway mediates the signaling of genes required for cellular development and homeostasis. To elucidate the effect of type I IFN on the Jak/stat pathway in salmonid alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV3) infected macrophage/dendritic like TO-cells derived from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) headkidney leukocytes, we used a differential transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGGs) pathway analysis to generate a repertoire of de novo assembled genes from type I IFN treated and non-treated TO-cells infected with SAV3. RESULTS: Concurrent SAV3 infection with type I IFN treatment of TO-cells suppressed SAV3 structural protein (SP) expression by 2log10 at 2 days post infection compared to SAV3 infection without IFN treatment which paved way to evaluating the impact of type I IFN on expression of Jak/stat pathway genes in SAV3 infected TO-cells. In the absence of type I IFN treatment, SAV3 downregulated several Jak/stat pathway genes that included type I and II receptor genes, Jak2, tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), Stat3 and Stat5 pointing to possible failure to activate the Jak/stat signaling pathway and inhibition of signal transducers caused by SAV3 infection. Although the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) genes 1 and 3 were upregulated in the IFN treated cells, only SOCS3 was downregulated in the SAV3 infected cells which points to inhibition of SOCS3 by SAV3 infection in TO-cells. CONCLUSION: Data presented in this study shows that SAV3 infection downregulates several genes of the Jak/stat pathway, which could be an immune evasion strategy, used to block the transcription of antiviral genes that would interfere with SAV3 replication in TO-cells. Overall, we have shown that combining de novo assembly with pathway based transcriptome analyses provides a contextual approach to understanding the molecular networks of genes that form the Jak/stat pathway in TO-cells infected by SAV3.",0
"The salmonid orthomyxovirus infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) causes disease of varying severity in farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. Field observations suggest that host factors, the environment and differences between ISAV strains attribute to the large variation in disease progression. Variation in host mortality and dissemination of ISAV isolates with high and low virulence (based on a previously published injection challenge) were investigated using immersion challenge. Virus dissemination was determined using real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry in several organs, including blood. Surprisingly, the low virulent virus (LVI) replicated and produced nucleoprotein at earlier time points post-infection compared to the virus of high virulence (HVI). This was particularly noticeable in the gills as indicated by different viral load profiles. However, the HVI reached a higher maximum viral load in all tested organs and full blood. This was associated with a higher mortality of 100% as compared to 20% in the LVI group by day 23 post-infection. Immersion challenge represented a more natural infection method and suggested that specific entry routes into the fish may be of key importance between ISAV strains. The results suggest that a difference in virulence is important for variations in virus dissemination and pathogenesis (disease development).",0

There are A-like, H1-like, Lea-like and Ley-like type HBGAs in digestive tissue of Crassostrea gigas. GII.4 genotype norovirus variants mainly bind with A-like, H1-like and Ley-like HBGA in Crassostrea gigas.",0
"Molecular (PCR) diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of aquareovirus in general, and Tasmanian Atlantic salmon reovirus (TSRV) specifically, were developed, and their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were determined and compared with virus isolation in cell culture. Intralaboratory and interlaboratory comparison of PCR (conventional hemi-nested RT-PCR & RT-qPCR) and virus isolation in cell culture using finfish cell lines, CHSE-214 and EPC, was carried out for the detection and identification of TSRV using field samples of farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, L. from various aquaculture sites around Tasmania. The interlaboratory comparison of diagnostic methods was carried out between two laboratories, AAHL-CSIRO and DPIPWE-Tasmania. A total of 144 fish from nine sites (12-33 fish per site) were sampled from two regions of Tasmania (Tamar River estuary in the north and Huon River estuary in the south-east) during late spring to early summer of 2009, and the data were analysed using different statistical approaches. The prevalence of TSRV ranged from 6% to 22% in both regions. All the diagnostic methods (data from both laboratories) had high specificity, while the estimated sensitivity varied between tests with RT-qPCR being the most sensitive (95.2%) method followed by virus isolation and then conventional hemi-nested RT-PCR.",0
"Saprolegnia isolates within the recognized clades encompassing the taxa S. parasitica and S. diclina act as opportunist and aggressive pathogens to both fish and their eggs. They are responsible for significant economic losses in aquaculture, particularly in salmonid hatcheries. However, the identity, distribution and pathogenic significance of involved species often remain unexplored. In this study, 89 Saprolegnia isolates were recovered from water, eggs and salmon tissue samples that originated from salmon (Salmo salar) hatcheries along the coast of Norway. The cultures were characterized morphologically and molecularly in order to provide an overview of the species composition of Saprolegnia spp. present in Norwegian salmon hatcheries. We demonstrate that S. diclina clearly dominated and contributed to 79% of the recovered isolates. Parsimony analyses of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region split these isolates into 2 strongly supported sub-clades, S. diclina sub-clade IIIA and IIIB, where sub-clade IIIB accounted for 66% of all isolates. A minor portion of the isolates constituted other taxa that were either conspecific or showed strong affinity to S. parasitica, S. ferax, S. hypogyna and Scoliolegnia asterophora. The unique sub-clade IIIB of S. diclina was most prevalent in water and salmon eggs, while S. parasitica isolates were more frequently isolated from post hatching stages. The study demonstrated that morphological criteria in many cases were insufficient for species delimitation due to lack of sexual structures or incoherent morphological expression of such features within the tested replicates.",0
"To investigate the effect of modified atmosphere packaging with different CO2 concentration (50% CO2 + 50% N2, 60% CO2 + 40% N2 and 70% CO2 + 30% N2) on quality of salmon (Salmonidae) in low temperature logistics with temperature fluctuation, sensory evaluation, pH value, a*-values, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), microbiological, and K-values were assayed periodically. The results showed that the three kinds of MAP were useful to restrain the quality degradation of salmon caused by the temperature variation in low temperature logistics. However, MAP (70% CO2 + 30 % N2) was the best for inhibiting microbial growth and histamine generation. The results suggested that MAP could decrease the quality degradation rate of salmon in inadequate low temperature logistics effectively.",0
"Currently, there is a growing demand to determine the protective status of vaccinated fish in order to prevent diseases outbreaks. A set of different parameters that include the infectious and immunological status of vaccinated salmonids from 622 Chilean farms were analyzed during 2011-2014. The aim of this study was to optimize the vaccination program of these centers through the determination of the protective state of vaccinated fish using oral immunizations. This state was determined from the association of the concentration of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the serum and the mortality rate of vaccinated fish. Salmonids were vaccinated with different commercial mono- or polyvalent vaccines against salmonid rickettsial septicemia (SRS) and infectious salmon anemia (ISA), first by the intraperitoneal injection of oil-adjuvanted antigens and then by the stimulation of mucosal immunity using oral vaccines as a booster vaccination. The results showed that high levels of specific IgM antibodies were observed after injectable vaccination, reaching a maximum concentration at 600-800 degree-days. Similar levels of antibodies were observed when oral immunizations were administrated. The high concentration of antibodies [above 2750 ng/mL for ISA virus (ISAv) and 3500 ng/mL for SRS] was maintained for a period of 800 degree-days after each vaccination procedure. In this regard, oral immunizations maintained a long-term high concentration of anti-SRS and anti-ISAv specific IgM antibodies. When the concentration of antibodies decreased below 2000 pg/mL, a window of susceptibility to SRS infection was observed in the farm, suggesting a close association between antibody levels and fish protective status. These results demonstrated that, in the field, several oral immunizations are essential to uphold a high level of specific anti-pathogens antibodies and, therefore, the protective status during the whole productive cycle.",0
"BACKGROUND: High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) combined with reuterin and lactoperoxidase system (LPS) has exerted antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon at chilled temperatures. Therefore the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of HHP combined with reuterin, LPS and lactoferrin (LF) on the survival of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in cold-smoked salmon stored at 4 and 10 degrees C. RESULTS: Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli O157:H7 were reduced more than 3 log colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1) by the pressure treatment (450 MPa/5 min). LPS slightly diminished pathogen levels throughout storage, whereas no effect was recorded when reuterin or LF was added. The Salmonella population was below the detection limit (<1 log CFU g(-1) ) during the storage of HHP-treated smoked salmon at 4 and 10 degrees C. The antimicrobial activity of HHP against E. coli O157:H7 was increased when 450 MPa was applied in combination with LPS in cold-smoked salmon at 4 and 10 degrees C. CONCLUSION: HHP at 450 MPa/5 min inactivated S. Enteritidis in cold-smoked salmon and in combination with LPS would be useful as a hurdle technology approach against E. coli O157:H7, even under mild temperature abuse conditions.

"The present experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of trace minerals (Cu, Zn and Mn) premixes from inorganic and chelated (chelated to 2-hydroxy-4-methylthiobutanoic acid or hydroxy analog of methionine; Mintrex) sources, in juvenile Pacific white shrimp, (Litopenaeus vannamei) fed plant protein based practical diets. Eight experimental diets comprising a trace minerals (Cu, Zn and Mn) deficient Basal control, and diets supplemented with the trace mineral premixes at four different levels of 2.5 (M2.5), 5 (M5), 7.5 (M7.5) and 8.5 g/kg (M8.5) from chelated source and at three different levels of 5 (I5), 8.5 (I8.5) and 20 g/kg (I20) from inorganic source were formulated. Eleven numbers of juvenile shrimp averaging 0.6 0.01 g (mean SD) were fed one of the eight experimental diets in triplicate groups for 8 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, shrimp fed M2.5 and I8.5 diets exhibited the similar final weight (FW) and weight gain (WG) (P< 0.05). Performance for Cu and Zn content in the hepatopancreas tissues and whole body showed equal efficiency of M5 compared to I8.5 diet (P< 0.05). Whereas, nonspecific enzyme, Cu->Zn super oxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD) from the serum and hepatopancreas tissue was recorded to be peaked for the group of shrimp fed M5 diet. Moreover, plasma protein and glucose levels were recorded to be similar between the groups of shrimp fed M2.5 and I20 diets (P< 0.05). Therefore, the present experiment demonstrated, a higher efficiency of chelated over inorganic source of trace mineral premix in Pacific white shrimp, (L. vannamei) fed plant protein based diets. Statement of relevance. The significance of trace mineral bioavailability has become more important as the composition of majority of commercial fish feed has been changing and there is an increased use of dietary plant protein. As a result, the bioavailability of trace minerals is being adversely affected by the presence of antagonistic factor such as phytic acid in plant protein. Even though, our knowledge in fish nutrition has advanced significantly, the information on trace minerals requirement is still limited and fragmentary. Inorganic form (sulfate/nitrate) of trace mineral has traditionally been used in aquafeed formulation. However, the limited bioavailability of inorganic source of trace mineral due to its higher affinity to antinutrients has hastened the search for alternative form of inorganic trace minerals. Overall performance observed in the present experiments vouched the potential benefit of using chelated trace mineral, Cu, Zn & Mn premix in marine shrimp, Pacific white shrimp to promote the optimum growth, trace minerals saturation in shrimp body and tissue as well as to ensure the optimum enzyme activity and health of cultured shrimp. The present experiment opens a new avenue to compare the efficacy of inorganic and chelated source of trace minerals in other commercially important marine and fresh water fish species. Whereas, the sustainability issue has put a new dimension in aquafeed formulation with a wide array of new ingredients and additives, on the other hand, the importance of basic nutrient such as trace minerals is still in sideline. Substantial investment and integrated scientific efforts are warranted to bridge the knowledge gap and further improve our understandings on the significance of dietary trace mineral in fish nutrition and health at the least cost to environment.

"Finite volume ocean circulation and particle tracking models are used to simulate water-borne transmission of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) among Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms in the Discovery Islands region of British Columbia, Canada. Historical simulations for April and July 2010 are carried out to demonstrate the seasonal impact of river discharge, wind, ultra-violet (UV) radiation, and heat flux conditions on near-surface currents, viral dispersion and survival. Numerical particles released from infected farm fish in accordance with IHNV shedding rates estimated through laboratory experiments are dispersed by model oceanic flows. Viral particles are inactivated by ambient UV radiation levels and by the natural microbial community at rates derived through laboratory studies. Viral concentration maps showing temporal and spatial changes are produced and combined with lab-determined minimum infectious dosages to estimate the infective connectivity among farms. Results demonstrate that neighbouring naive farms can become exposed to IHNV via water-borne transport from an IHNV diseased farm, with a higher risk in April than July, and that many events in the sequence of farm outbreaks in 2001-2002 are consistent with higher risks in our farm connectivity matrix. Applications to other diseases, transfers between farmed and wild fish, and the effect of vaccinations are also discussed.",0
"The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in a selected fish and seafood processing line. Results showed that during 2013, 12.4%, 8.3% and 2.3% of fish, seafood salads and environmental swabs were positive for L. monocytogenes. All positive food samples showed a contamination level below 100 CFU/g. Environmental swabs from surface of slicing and trimming tables, slicing machines, fish filleting and trimming knives, belt glazer and working table were positive for L. monocytogenes. Therefore, strict attention must be paid to cleaning and disinfection to control the level of L. monocytogenes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"The effects of 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (DHMBA), and zinc--both components of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas--were examined by glutamatergic neuron activity in rats in an in vivo microdialysis experiment and an in vitro brain slice experiment. The basal concentration of extracellular glutamate in the hippocampus was decreased under hippocampal perfusion with DHMBA (1 mmol l(-1)) or ZnCl2 (mumol l(-1)), indicating that DHMBA and Zn(2+) suppress glutamatergic neuron activity under basal (static) conditions. To assess the preventive effect of DHMBA and Zn(2+) on glutamate release from neuron terminals, brain slices were pretreated with DHMBA (1 mmol l(-1)) or ZnCl2 (100 nmol l(-1)) for 1 h, then stimulated with high K(+). A high, K(+)-induced increase in extracellular Zn(2+) level, an index of glutamate release, was suppressed with pretreatment with DHMBA or zinc. A high, K(+)-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) level was also suppressed with pretreatment with DHMBA or Zn(2+). These results suggest that DHMBA and Zn(2+), previously taken up in the hippocampal cells, suppress high, K(+)-induced glutamate release in the hippocampus, probably via presynaptic suppression of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. It is likely that Zn(2+) and DHMBA play a preventive role in suppressing excess glutamatergic neuron activity in rats and mice.",0
"Interleukin (IL)-23 is a heterodimeric IL-12 family cytokine composed of a p19 alpha-chain, linked to a p40 beta-chain that is shared with IL-12. IL-23 is distinguished functionally from IL-12 by its ability to induce the production of IL-17, and differentiation of Th17 cells in mammals. Three isoforms of p40 (p40a, p40b and p40c) have been found in some 3R teleosts. Salmonids also possess three p40 isoforms (p40b1, p40b2 and p40c) although p40a is missing, and two copies (paralogues) of p40b are present that have presumably been retained following the 4R duplication in this fish lineage. Teleost p19 has been discovered recently in zebrafish, but to date there is limited information on expression and modulation of this molecule. In this report we have cloned two p19 paralogues (p19a and p19b) in salmonids, suggesting that a salmonid can possess six potential IL-23 isoforms. Whilst Atlantic salmon has two active p19 genes, the rainbow trout p19b gene may have been pseudogenized. The salmonid p19 translations share moderate identities (22.8-29.9%) to zebrafish and mammalian p19 molecules, but their identity was supported by structural features, a conserved 4 exon/3 intron gene organisation, and phylogenetic tree analysis. The active salmonid p19 genes are highly expressed in blood and gonad. Bacterial (Yersinia ruckeri) and viral infection in rainbow trout induces the expression of p19a, suggesting pathogen-specific induction of IL-23 isoforms. Trout p19a expression was also induced by PAMPs (poly IC and peptidoglycan) and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta in primary head kidney macrophages. These data may indicate diverse functional roles of trout IL-23 isoforms in regulating the immune response in fish.",0
"Annexins are multifunctional, calcium-binding proteins found in organisms across all kingdoms. Most studies of annexins from single-celled eukaryotes have focused on the alpha-giardins, proteins assigned to the group E annexins, expressed by the diplomonad Giardia intestinalis. We have characterized the annexin gene family in another diplomonad parasite, Spironucleus salmonicida, by phylogenetic and experimental approaches. We constructed a comprehensive phylogeny of the diplomonad group E annexins and found that they are abundant across the group with frequent gene duplications and losses. The annexins of S. salmonicida were found to be related to alpha-giardins but with better-preserved type II Ca(2+) coordination sites. Two annexins were confirmed to bind phospholipids in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion but with different specificities. Superresolution and confocal microscopy of epitope-tagged S. salmonicida annexins revealed localization to distinct parts of the cytoskeleton and membrane. The ultrastructural details of the localization of several annexins were determined by proximity labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Two annexins localize to a novel cytoskeletal structure in the anterior of the cell. Our results show that the annexin gene family is expanded in diplomonads and that these group E annexins are associated mostly with cytoskeletal and membrane structures. IMPORTANCE Annexins are proteins that associate with phospholipids in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. These proteins have been intensely studied in animals and plants because of their importance in diverse cellular processes, yet very little is known about annexins in single-celled eukaryotes, which represent the largest diversity of organisms. The human intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis is known to have more annexins than humans, and they contribute to its pathogenic potential. In this study, we investigated the annexin complement in the salmon pathogen Spironucleus salmonicida, a relative of G. intestinalis. We found that S. salmonicida has a large repertoire of annexins and that the gene family has expanded separately across diplomonads, with members showing sequence diversity similar to that seen across kingdom-level groups such as plants and animals. S. salmonicida annexins are prominent components of the cytoskeleton and membrane. Two annexins are associated with a previously unrecognized structure in the anterior of the cell.",0
"Maturing male and female Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) were held under three temperature regimes for 10 weeks between September and December: warm (constant 14-16 degrees C), ambient (decreasing from 11 to 5 degrees C), and cold (decreasing from 7 to 3 degrees C). Blood samples were analyzed for plasma steroid levels, and the fish were inspected for the presence of expressible milt (total volume and spermatocrit) and ovulation weekly. Samples of eggs were dry-fertilized with milt stripped from three males held at the same temperatures and incubated until the eyed stage. In females, levels of plasma testosterone (T) and 17beta-oestradiol (E2) dropped as ovulation approached, concurrent with a rapid increase in levels of plasma 17alpha,20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20beta-P). In males, levels of T and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) peaked 2-3 weeks after the first appearance of expressible milt, while levels of 17,20beta-P increased steadily and did not exhibit a definite peak. Exposure of females to cold water amplified and advanced the profiles of all three steroids compared with the ambient group, and increased the survival rates to the eyed egg stage. Cold water had no immediate effect on the male steroid profiles, but later, higher levels of 17,20beta-P were evident compared with both the ambient controls and the warm water group, while the effects on 11-KT and T were more variable. Exposure to warm water completely inhibited both milt production and ovulation. Moreover, warm water modulated the steroid profiles of the males with lower 11-KT levels compared with ambient controls and lower 17,20beta-P level compared with cold-water-treated males. In females, warm water resulted in total inhibition of the peri-ovulatory peak in 17,20beta-P and prevented the normal decline of T and E2 levels associated with ovulation. The findings of the present study are highly relevant for broodstock management in aquaculture, as well in understanding the impact of climate change/temperature variability on wild salmon spawning.",1
"Viral diseases represent serious challenge in marine farming of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L). Pancreas disease (PD) caused by a salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is by far the most serious in northern Europe. To control PD, it is necessary to identify virus transmission routes. One aspect to consider is whether the virus is transported as free particles or associated with potential vectors. Farmed salmonids have high lipid content in their tissue which may be released into the environment from decomposing dead fish. At the seawater surface, the effects of wind and ocean currents are most prominent. The aim of this study was primarily to identify whether the lipid fraction leaking from dead infected salmon contains SAV. Adipose tissue from dead SAV-infected fish from three farming sites was submerged in beakers with sea water in the laboratory and stored at different temperature and time conditions. SAV was identified by real-time RT-PCR in the lipid fractions accumulating at the water surface in the beakers. SAV-RNA was also present in the sea water. Lipid fractions were transferred to cell culture, and viable SAV was identified. Due to its hydrophobic nature, fat with infective pathogenic virus at the surface may contribute to long-distance transmission of SAV.",1
"Interannual variability of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), measured in the soft tissues of Mytilus galloprovincialis mussels and Crassostrea gigas oysters, collected from estuarine waters within the Basque Country (Bay of Biscay), are investigated. Samples were collected in the autumn, between 2002 and 2011. Sites located within the ports of Bilbao and Pasaia showed the highest PCBs concentrations in molluscs; the lowest were observed in the mouth of the Oka estuary, an area of low population and industrial activity. Congener profiles of PCBs in the tissues of molluscs reveal the predominance of hexachlorobiphenyls (CB153 and CB138). In addition, redundancy analysis has shown that residence time, river flow and a 'pressure index' explain 57% of the variability in the PCB congener concentrations (the higher the values of these variables, the higher the concentration). Finally, Sigma7PCB median concentrations in molluscs and sediments, collected from nearby sampling sites, were found to be moderately correlated (r(2)=0.513, p<0.01).",1
"The infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is a severe disease that mainly affects the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture industry. Although several transcriptional studies have aimed to understand Salmon-ISAV interaction through the evaluation of host-gene transcription, none of them has focused their attention upon the viral transcriptional dynamics. For this purpose, RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses were conducted in gills, liver and head-kidney of S. salar challenged by cohabitation with ISAV. Results evidence the time and tissue transcript patterns involved in the viral expression and how the transcription levels of ISAV segments are directly linked with the protein abundance found in other virus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. In addition, RT-qPCR result evidenced that quantification of ISAV through amplification of segment 3 would result in a more sensitive approach for detection and quantification of ISAV. This study offers a more comprehensive approach regarding the ISAV infective process and gives novel knowledge for its molecular detection.",0
"The direct exposure of fish eggs to ozonated water has generated interest as a means of ensuring pathogen-free eggs without the use of harsh chemicals. However, there are numerous knowledge gaps, including safe contact times, exposure levels, and potential long-term effects on aquaculture species in both freshwater and seawater. The effect of different ozone (O3) doses (0.5-1.0, 1.5-2.0, and 2.5-3.0 mg of O3/L for 90 s) on recently fertilized eggs of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua and eyed eggs of Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss was evaluated in comparison with the effects of two commercial disinfectants: Perosan (0.004 mg/L) and Ovadine (100 mg/L). The impact of ozone application was evaluated based on hatching success, larval nucleic acid concentration, larval growth, and survival. Overall, results indicated that ozonation of Atlantic Cod eggs at a dose less than 3.0 mg/L for 90 s produced no negative effect on the larvae up to 30 d posthatch. Furthermore, ozonation of Atlantic Salmon and Rainbow Trout eggs generated no negative effect on the larvae, based on monitoring until 85% yolk sac re-absorption (16 d posthatch).",0
"BACKGROUND: Pancreas disease (PD), caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV), is an important disease affecting salmonid aquaculture. It has been speculated that Atlantic salmon post-smolts are more prone to infections in the first few weeks following seawater- transfer. After this period of seawater acclimatization, the post-smolts are more robust and better able to resist infection by pathogens. Here we describe how we established a bath immersion (BI) model for SAV subtype 3 (SAV3) in seawater. We also report how this challenge model was used to study the susceptibility of post-smolts to SAV3 infection in two groups of post-smolts two weeks or nine weeks after seawater - transfer. METHODS: Post-smolts, two weeks (Phase-A) or nine weeks (Phase-B) after seawater- transfer, were infected with SAV3 by BI or intramuscular injection (IM) to evaluate their susceptibility to infection. A RT-qPCR assay targeting the non-structural protein (nsP1) gene was performed to detect SAV3-RNA in blood, heart tissue and electropositive-filtered tank-water. Histopathological changes were examined by light microscope, and the presence of SAV3 antigen in pancreas tissue was confirmed using immuno-histochemistry. RESULTS: Virus shedding from the Phase-B fish injected with SAV3 (IM Phase-B) was markedly lower than that from IM Phase-A fish. A lower percentage of viraemia in Phase-B fish compared with Phase-A fish was also observed. Viral RNA in hearts from IM Phase-A fish was higher than in IM Phase-B fish at all sampling points (p < 0.05) and a similar trend was also seen in the BI groups. Necrosis of exocrine pancreatic cells was observed in all infected groups. Extensive histopathological changes were found in Phase-A fish whereas milder PD-related histopathological lesions were seen in Phase-B fish. The presence of SAV3 in pancreas tissue from all infected groups was also confirmed by immuno-histochemical staining. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that post-smolts are more susceptible to SAV3 infection two weeks after seawater-transfer than nine weeks after transfer. In addition, the BI challenge model described here offers an alternative SAV3 infection model when better control of the time-of-infection is essential for studying basic immunological mechanisms and disease progression.",0
"The discovery of colored oysters in an estuary in Southern China raised questions of how these oysters could survive in such an unpredictable estuary. In the present study, the authors conducted a transplant experiment using oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis in the estuary to quantify the changes of metal biokinetics (Cd and Zn) and the responses of metallothionein-like proteins. Oysters in the transplantation experiment accumulated extremely high concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Zn. The present study provided the field evidence of the time-course coupling relationship between Cd and Zn bioaccumulation. Over the 2-mo transplantation, the uptake rate constants of Cd and Zn varied greatly during the early stage of exposure but subsequently became comparable among the different locations. The dietary Zn assimilation remained relatively constant, whereas the Cd assimilation increased gradually with increasing period of exposure. No notable difference was seen in dietary metal assimilation among the different locations. In contrast, the efflux rates quantified by the end of transplantation were 26% to 42% higher for Cd and 12% to 37% higher for Zn than that in the unexposed oysters. The authors further demonstrated that the incoming Cu and Zn were not stored in metallothionein-like pools and that metallothionein-like proteins synthesis and breakdown were little affected by metal exposure. Overall, the authors' transplantation experiments suggested that oysters displayed a rather weak ability to modify their biokinetics and metallothionein turnover under metal exposure.",0
"Animals and plants are increasingly threatened by emerging fungal and oomycete diseases. Amongst oomycetes, Saprolegnia species cause population declines in aquatic animals, especially fish and amphibians, resulting in significant perturbation in biodiversity, ecological balance and food security. Due to the prohibition of several chemical control agents, novel sustainable measures are required to control Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture. Previously, fungal community analysis by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) revealed that the Ascomycota, specifically the genus Microdochium, was an abundant fungal phylum associated with salmon eggs from a commercial fish farm. Here, phylogenetic analyses showed that most fungal isolates obtained from salmon eggs were closely related to Microdochium lycopodinum/Microdochium phragmitis and Trichoderma viride species. Phylogenetic and quantitative PCR analyses showed both a quantitative and qualitative difference in Trichoderma population between diseased and healthy salmon eggs, which was not the case for the Microdochium population. In vitro antagonistic activity of the fungi against Saprolegnia diclina was isolate-dependent; for most Trichoderma isolates, the typical mycoparasitic coiling around and/or formation of papilla-like structures on S. diclina hyphae were observed. These results suggest that among the fungal community associated with salmon eggs, Trichoderma species may play a role in Saprolegnia suppression in aquaculture.",0
"Introduction. Smoke processing of fish is used for food preservation by First Nations communities. Unlike in commercial smoke processing where the control for temperature is well executed to allow consistent smoke exposure for RTE smoked fish products, little control is practiced by First Nations' methods. Purpose. The purpose of our study was to determine the polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) residue content in smoked fish and relate this to the antimicrobial properties of partially and fully smoked fish, respectively. Methods. Commercial smoked salmon were purchased from local grocers (cold-smoked; < 43√ÅC). Half-smoked (2-3 days) and fully-smoked (5-6 days) salmon were obtained from Tl'azt'en and Lieidli T'enneh First Nations communities and previously smoked at temperatures greater than 85√ÅC. PAH measurements were performed by GC-MS, using authentic standards with detection limits within 1ng/g. Fish fatty acids were measured by GCFID. The lipid peroxides were measured using the ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) assay. Antimicrobial property of PAHs against Listeria innocua was tested in brain-heart infusion broth. A disk diffusion assay was also used to test the antimicrobial activity of hexane extracts recovered from smoked commercial and First Nations' fish samples. Results. PAHs were not detected in commercial cold smoked fish; in contrast to First Nations' fully smoked salmon, which had significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of both low and high molecular weight PAHs. PAHs recovered from half-smoked fish were low molecular weight. Salmon processed using First Nations' methods exhibited significantly reduced lipid peroxides and enhanced retention of EPA and DHA (P < 0.05). The generation of low molecular weight PAH's generated from partial and full smoking of fish significantly increased lag-phase and lowered maximum growth (P< 0.05) of Listeria innocua. Significance. These data suggest that risks associated with PAH contamination of salmon, derived from First Nations' smoke preservation methods, also provide benefits of retained nutritional value and antimicrobial activity.",0
"The pearl oyster Pinctada fucata is cultured widely for production of marine pearls in China, while mass mortalities, likely related to pathogenic infections, have occurred frequently in juvenile, mother and operated oysters. To address this issue, understanding host defense mechanisms of P. fucata against pathogenic challenge is extremely important. In the present study, a comparative analysis of hemocyte transcriptomes of P. fucata before and after Vibrio alginolyticus infection was conducted using the Illumina/Hiseq-2000 RNA-Seq technology. A total of 56,345,139 clean reads were generated and then assembled into 74,007 unigenes with an average length of 680 bp and an N50 of 1197 bp. Unigenes were annotated by comparing against non-redundant protein sequence (nr), non-redundant nucleotide (nt), Swiss-Prot, Pfam, Gene Ontology database (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, and 29,615 unigenes (40.01%) were annotated in at least one database. There were 636 genes (518 up-regulated and 118 down-regulated) that were significantly differentially expressed after bacterial challenge, and among which 369 were associated with 122 pathways, including classical immune-related pathways, such as 'MAPK signaling pathway', 'Chemokine signaling pathway', 'Apoptosis' and 'Wnt signaling pathway'. These findings provide information on the pearl oyster innate immunity and may contribute to developing strategies for management of diseases and long-term sustainability of P. fucata culture.",0
"Infectious diseases are a constant threat to industrialised farming, which is characterised by high densities of farms and farm animals. Several mathematical and statistical models on spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious diseases in various farmed host populations have been developed during the last decades. Here we present a spatio-temporal stochastic model for the spread of a disease between and within aquaculture farms. The spread between farms is divided into several transmission pathways, including (i) distance related spread and (ii) other types of contagious contacts. The within-farm infection dynamics is modelled by a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. We apply this framework to model the spread of pancreas disease (PD) in salmon farming, using data covering all farms producing salmonids over 9 years in Norway. The motivation for the study was partly to unravel the spatio-temporal dynamics of PD in salmon farming and partly to use the model for scenario simulation of PD control strategies. We find, for example, that within-farm infection dynamics vary with season and we provide estimates of the timing from unobserved infection events to disease outbreaks on farms are detected. The simulations suggest that if a strategy involving culling of infectious cohorts is implemented, the number of detected disease outbreaks per year may be reduced by 57% after the full effect has been reached. We argue that the high detail and coverage of data on salmonid production and disease occurrence should encourage the use of simulation modelling as a means of testing effects of extensive control measures before they are implemented in the salmon farming industry.",0
"BACKGROUND: Little is known about correlates of vitamin D status in Asian populations. In this study, we established the prevalence of vitamin D sufficiency in the Murakami region (latitude N38 degrees 13') in Niigata, Japan, and examined demographic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that might be associated with vitamin D sufficiency, with the aim of clarifying the relative contributions of previously described determinants of vitamin D status as well as identifying new determinants in this Japanese population. METHODS: This study involved a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data obtained from a cohort study conducted in 2011-2013. Participants were 9084 individuals aged between 40 and 74 years who provided blood samples for the determination of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations. Lifestyle information was obtained from 8498 participants, with some missing values regarding different lifestyle factors. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to obtain odds ratios for vitamin D sufficiency, which was defined as a plasma 25(OH)D concentration >/= 75 nmol/L. RESULTS: The prevalence of vitamin D sufficiency (i.e., plasma 25(OH)D concentration >/= 75 nmol/L) was 9.1%, and significant associations were observed with male gender (P<0.0001; OR=2.37, 95% CI: 1.84-3.05), older age (P for trend <0.0001), lower BMI (P for trend <0.0001), higher METs score (P for trend=0.0138), higher vitamin D intake (P for trend=0.0467), summer season (P for trend <0.0001), longer duration outdoors (P for trend=0.0026), no sunscreen use (P=0.0135; OR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.07-1.82), higher salmon consumption (P for trend <0.0001), higher alcohol consumption (P for trend <0.0001), and lower coffee consumption (P for trend=0.0025). Unlike other populations previously reported, vitamin D sufficiency was associated with older age. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of vitamin D sufficiency (i.e., 25[OH]D >/= 75 nmol/L) was low (9.1%) in this Japanese population. A number of demographic, environmental, and lifestyle factors are associated with vitamin D sufficiency, and thus lifestyle modification may present an opportunity to achieve vitamin D sufficiency.",0
"Antibiotics have been extensively used against infections produced by Piscirickettsia salmonis, a fish pathogen and causative agent of piscirickettsiosis and one of the major concerns for the Chilean salmon industry. Therefore, the emergence of resistant phenotypes is to be expected. With the aim of obtaining a landscape of the antimicrobial resistance of P. salmonis in Chile, the susceptibility profiles for quinolones, florfenicol and oxytetracycline (OTC) of 292 field isolates derived from main rearing areas, different hosts and collected over 5 years were assessed. The results allowed for the determination of epidemiological cut-off values that were used to characterize the pathogen population. This work represents the first large-scale field study addressing the antimicrobial susceptibility of P. salmonis, providing evidence of the existence of resistant types with a high incidence of resistance to quinolones. Remarkably, despite the amounts and frequency of therapies, our results disclosed that the issue of resistance to florfenicol and OTC is still in the onset.",0
"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a global contaminant of concern and human exposures are largely realized via seafood consumption. While it is assumed that 95-100% of the ingested MeHg from seafood reaches systemic circulation, recent in vitro studies have yielded results to suggest otherwise. Of the published studies to have characterized the bioaccessibility or bioavailability of MeHg from seafood, only a handful of seafood species have been characterized, there exists tremendous variability in data within and across species, few species of relevance to North America have been studied, and none of the in vitro studies have adapted results to an epidemiology study. The objective of the current study was two-fold: (a) to characterize in vitro MeHg bioaccessibility and bioavailability from ten commonly consumed types of seafood in North America; and (b) to apply the bioaccessibility and bioavailability data from the in vitro study to an existing human MeHg exposure assessment study. Raw seafood samples (cod, crab, halibut, salmon, scallop, shrimp, tilapia, and three tuna types: canned light, canned white, fresh) were purchased in Montreal and their MeHg concentrations generally overlapped with values reported elsewhere. The bioaccessibility of MeHg from these samples ranged from 50.1+/-19.2 (canned white tuna) to 100% (shrimp and scallop) of the amount measured in the raw undigested sample. The bioavailability of MeHg from these samples ranged from 29.3+/-10.4 (crab) to 67.4+/-9.7% (salmon) of the value measured in the raw undigested sample. There were significant correlations between the initial MeHg concentration in seafood with the percent of that Hg that was bioaccessible (r=-0.476) and bioavailable (r=-0.294). When the in vitro data were applied to an existing MeHg exposure assessment study, the estimated amount of MeHg absorbed into systemic circulation decreased by 25% and 42% when considering bioaccessibility and bioavailability, respectively. When the in vitro data were integrated into a regression model relating dietary MeHg intake from seafood with hair and blood Hg biomarkers, there were no differences in key model parameters when comparing the default model (that assumes 100% bioavailability) with models adjusted for the in vitro bioaccessibility and bioavailability data. In conclusion this work adds to a growing number of studies that together suggest that MeHg bioavailability from seafood may be less than 100%, but also documents the challenges when integrating such in vitro data into human exposure and risk assessments.",0
"Atlantic salmon's (Salmo salar) annual aquaculture production exceeds 2M tonnes globally, and for the UK forms the largest single food export. However, aquaculture production is negatively affected by a range of different diseases and parasites. Effort to control pathogens should be focused on those which are most ""important"" to aquaculture. It is difficult to specify what makes a pathogen important; this is particularly true in the aquatic sector where data capture systems are less developed than for human or terrestrial animal diseases. Mortality levels might be one indicator, but these can cause a range of different problems such as persistent endemic losses, occasional large epidemics or control/treatment costs. Economic and multi-criteria decision methods can incorporate this range of impacts, however these have not been consistently applied to aquaculture and the quantity and quality of data required is large, so their potential for comparing aquatic pathogens is currently limited. A method that has been developed and applied to both human and terrestrial animal diseases is the analysis of published scientific literature using the H-index method. We applied this method to salmon pathogens using Web of Science searches for 23 pathogens. The top 3 H-indices were obtained for: sea lice, furunculosis, and infectious salmon anaemia; post 2000, Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD) replaced furunculosis. The number of publications per year describing bacterial disease declined significantly, while those for viruses and sea lice increased significantly. This reflects effective bacterial control by vaccination, while problems related to viruses and sea lice have increased. H-indices by country reflected different national concerns (e.g. AGD ranked top for Australia). Averaged national H-indices for salmon diseases tend to increase with log of salmon production; countries with H-Indices significantly below the trend line have suffered particularly large disease losses. The H-index method, supported by other literature analyses, is consistent with the nature and history of salmon diseases and so provides a useful quantitative measure for comparing different diseases in the absence of other measures.",0
"Pancreas disease (PD) is an important viral disease in Norwegian, Scottish and Irish aquaculture causing biological losses in terms of reduced growth, mortality, increased feed conversion ratio, and carcass downgrading. We developed a bio-economic model to investigate the economic benefits of a disease triggered early harvesting strategy to control PD losses. In this strategy, the salmon farm adopts a PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) diagnostic screening program to monitor the virus levels in stocks. Virus levels are used to forecast a clinical outbreak of pancreas disease, which then initiates a prescheduled harvest of the stock to avoid disease losses. The model is based on data inputs from national statistics, literature, company data, and an expert panel, and use stochastic simulations to account for the variation and/or uncertainty associated with disease effects and selected production expenditures. With the model, we compared the impacts of a salmon farm undergoing prescheduled harvest versus the salmon farm going through a PD outbreak. We also estimated the direct costs of a PD outbreak as the sum of biological losses, treatment costs, prevention costs, and other additional costs, less the costs of insurance pay-outs. Simulation results suggests that the economic benefit from a prescheduled harvest is positive once the average salmon weight at the farm has reached 3.2kg or more for an average Norwegian salmon farm stocked with 1,000,000smolts and using average salmon sales prices for 2013. The direct costs from a PD outbreak occurring nine months (average salmon weight 1.91kg) after sea transfer and using 2013 sales prices was on average estimated at NOK 55.4 million (5%, 50% and 90% percentile: 38.0, 55.8 and 72.4) (NOK=euro0.128 in 2013). Sensitivity analyses revealed that the losses from a PD outbreak are sensitive to feed- and salmon sales prices, and that high 2013 sales prices contributed to substantial losses associated with a PD outbreak.",1
"Human enteric viruses are among the main causative agents of shellfish-associated outbreaks. In this study, the kinetics of viral bioaccumulation in live oysters and the heat stabilities of the predominant enteric viruses were determined both in tissue culture and in oyster tissues. A human norovirus (HuNoV) GII.4 strain, HuNoV surrogates (murine norovirus [MNV-1], Tulane virus [TV]), hepatitis A virus (HAV), and human rotavirus (RV) bioaccumulated to high titers within oyster tissues, with different patterns of bioaccumulation for the different viruses. We tested the thermal stability of each virus at 62, 72, and 80 degrees C in culture medium. The viruses can be ranked from the most heat resistant to the least stable as follows: HAV, RV, TV, MNV-1. In addition, we found that oyster tissues provided protection to the viruses during heat treatment. To decipher the mechanism underlying viral inactivation by heat, purified TV was treated at 80 degrees C for increasing time intervals. It was found that the integrity of the viral capsid was disrupted, whereas viral genomic RNA remained intact. Interestingly, heat treatment leading to complete loss of TV infectivity was not sufficient to completely disrupt the receptor binding activity of TV, as determined by the porcine gastric mucin-magnetic bead binding assay. Similarly, HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) and a HuNoV GII.4 strain retained some receptor binding ability following heat treatment. Although foodborne viruses have variable heat stability, 80 degrees C for >6 min was sufficient to completely inactivate enteric viruses in oysters, with the exception of HAV.",0
"Limited evidence exists on the latent effects of toxicant exposure on the seawater adaptability of anadromous salmon and steelhead. It is unclear whether such an effect exists for the widely used and relatively non-toxic herbicide endothall. Coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (coho), Chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha (Chinook), and anadromous rainbow trout, O. mykiss (steelhead) were subjected to a 10-day seawater challenge following freshwater treatments [0-12 mg acid equivalent (a.e)./L at 96 h]. Mean survival resulted in 82 % (n = 225), 84 % (n = 133), 90 % (n = 73) and 59 % (n = 147) survival for 0, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12 mg a.e./L, respectively. Our results indicate a lower toxicity threshold compared with previously reported acute toxicity results, but higher compared with previous seawater challenge studies. We demonstrate the utility of the seawater challenge assay to accurately define toxic effects of pesticides on salmonids with complex life-histories.",0
"Melanised focal changes (black spots) are common findings in the white skeletal muscle of seawater-farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Fillets with melanised focal changes are considered as lower quality and cause large economic losses. It has been suggested that red focal changes (red spots) precede the melanised focal changes. In the present work, we examined different populations of captive and wild salmon for the occurrence of both types of changes, which were investigated for the presence of different viruses by immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR. The occurrence of red or melanised foci varied significantly between the populations, from none in wild fish control group, low prevalence of small foci in fish kept in in-house tanks, to high prevalence of large foci in farm-raised salmon. Large amounts of Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) antigen were detected in all foci. No other viruses were detected. Red focal changes contained significantly higher levels of PRV RNA than apparently non-affected areas in white muscle of the same individuals. Some changes displayed a transient form between a red and melanised pathotype, indicating a progression from an acute to a chronic manifestation. We conclude that PRV is associated with the focal pathological changes in the white muscle of farmed Atlantic salmon and is a premise for the development of focal melanised changes.",0
"BACKGROUND: Environmental pollutants such as dioxins and PCBs, heavy metals, and organochlorine pesticides are a global threat to food safety. In particular, the aquatic biota can bioaccumulate many of these contaminants potentially making seafood of concern for chronic exposure to humans. OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to evaluate trends of contaminant levels in Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon in light of the derived tolerable intakes. METHODS: Through an EU-instigated surveillance programme, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) has between 1999 and 2011 collected more than 2300 samples of Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for contaminant analyses. The fillets of these fish were homogenised and analysed for dioxins, PCBs, heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides. RESULTS: The levels of the contaminants mercury, arsenic, dioxins, dioxin-like PCBs and DDT in Norwegian farmed salmon fillet have decreased during our period of analyses. The levels of cadmium, lead and several organochlorine pesticides were too close to the limit of quantification to calculate time trends. For PCB6 and quantifiable amounts of pesticides, except DDT, stable levels were observed. CONCLUSION: The contaminant levels in Norwegian farmed salmon have generally decreased between 1999 and 2011. Excluding other dietary sources, the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in 2011 allowed consumption of up to 1.3kg salmon per week to reach the tolerable weekly intake. The group of contaminants which was the limiting factor for safe consumption of Norwegian farmed salmon, based on currently established TWI values, is the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.",0
"Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a systemic disease caused by an orthomyxovirus, which has a significant economic impact on the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Currently, there are several commercial ISA vaccines available, however, those products are applied through injection, causing stress in the fish and leaving them susceptible to infectious diseases due to the injection process and associated handling. In this study, we evaluated an oral vaccine against ISA containing a recombinant viral hemagglutinin-esterase and a fusion protein as antigens. Our findings indicated that oral vaccination is able to protect Atlantic salmon against challenge with a high-virulence Chilean isolate. The oral vaccination was also correlated with the induction of IgM-specific antibodies. On the other hand, the vaccine was unable to modulate expression of the antiviral related gene Mx, showing the importance of the humoral response to the disease survival. This study provides new insights into fish protection and immune response induced by an oral vaccine against ISA, but also promises future development of preventive solutions or validation of the current existing therapies.",0
"The black-lip pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera is a protandrous hermaphrodite species. Its economic value has led to the development of controlled hatchery reproduction techniques, although many aspects remain to be optimized. In order to understand reproductive mechanisms and their controlling factors, two independent experiments were designed to test hypotheses of gametogenesis and sex ratio control by environmental and hormonal factors. In one, pearl oysters were exposed under controlled conditions at different combinations of temperature (24 and 28 degrees C) and food level (10,000 and 40,000 cells mL(-1) ); whereas in the other, pearl oysters were conditioned under natural conditions into the lagoon and subjected to successive 17beta-estradiol injections (100 mug per injection). Gametogenesis and sex ratio were assessed by histology for each treatment. In parallel, mRNA expressions of nine marker genes of the sexual pathway (pmarg-foxl2, pmarg-c43476, pmarg-c45042, pmarg-c19309, pmarg-c54338, pmarg-vit6, pmarg-zglp1, pmarg-dmrt, and pmarg-fem1-like) were investigated. Maximum maturation was observed in the treatment combining the highest temperature (28 degrees C) and the highest microalgae concentration (40,000 cells mL(-1) ), where the female sex tended to be maintained. Injection of 17beta-estradiol induced a significant increase of undetermined stage proportion 2 weeks after the final injection. These results suggest that gametogenesis and gender in adult pearl oysters can be controlled by environmental factors and estrogens. While there were no significant effects on relative gene expression, the 3-gene-pair expression ratio model of the sexual pathway of P. margaritifera, suggest a probable dominance of genetic sex determinism without excluding a mixed sex determination mode (genetic + environmental).

"A novel method was developed to detect four lipophilic shellfish toxins (OA, SPX1, DTX1, and AZA1) in edible shellfish products via a combination of QuEChERS technology and high performance liquid chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLCMS/MS). The samples were homogeneously extracted with acetonitrile-water (85%, V/V) and purified with QuEChERS technology. Using C18 column with acetonitrile/water (2 mmol/L ammonium acetate, 0.1% formic acid) as mobile phase, the analytes were separated by HPLC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, followed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Quantification was performed by external standard calibration method. The limits of detection (LOD, S/N=3) for OA and DTX1 were 10 mug/kg, the calibration curves showed good linearity in the range of 1.0 to 100 mug/L, while the LOD for AZA1 and SPX1 was 1.0 mug/kg, with a linearity range between 1.0 20 mug/L. The correlation coefficients (r~2) were > 0.999 for all four toxins. The average spiked recoveries of the shellfish toxins at three concentration levels were between 81.9% and 93.1% while relative standard deviation (RSD) was < 5%. A total of 15 import and export samples of fish including mussels, octopus, geoducks, and oysters were screened by this newly developed method and SPX1 toxin was found in 5 samples. This method is quick, easy-to-perform, sensitive, and appropriate to detect lipophilic shellfish toxins in shellfish products.",0
"Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a serious disease of marine-farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) caused by ISA virus (ISAV), belonging to the genus Isavirus, family Orthomyxoviridae. There is an urgent need to understand the virulence factors and pathogenic mechanisms of ISAV and to develop new vaccine approaches. Using a recombinant molecular biology approach, we report the development of a plasmid-based reverse genetic system for ISAV, which includes the use of a novel fish promoter, the Atlantic salmon internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS-1). Salmon cells cotransfected with pSS-URG-based vectors expressing the eight viral RNA segments and four cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based vectors that express the four proteins of the ISAV ribonucleoprotein complex allowed the generation of infectious recombinant ISAV (rISAV). We generated three recombinant viruses, wild-type rISAV(901_09) and rISAVr(S6-NotI-HPR) containing a NotI restriction site and rISAV(S6/EGFP-HPR) harboring the open reading frame of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), both within the highly polymorphic region (HPR) of segment 6. All rescued viruses showed replication activity and cytopathic effect in Atlantic salmon kidney-infected cells. The fluorescent recombinant viruses also showed a characteristic cytopathic effect in salmon cells, and the viruses replicated to a titer of 6.5105 PFU/ml,similar to that of the wild-type virus. This novel reverse genetics system offers a powerful tool to study the molecular biology of ISAV and to develop a new generation of ISAV vaccines to prevent and mitigate ISAV infection, which has had a profound effect on the salmon industry.",0
"Due to increasing resistance to chemical therapeutants, the use of 'cleaner fish' (primarily wrasse, Labridae, species) has become popular in European salmon farming for biocontrol of the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer). While being efficient de-licers, cleaner fish mortality levels in salmon cages are commonly high, and systemic bacterial infections constitute a major problem. Atypical furunculosis, caused by Aeromonas salmonicida A-layer types V and VI, is among the most common diagnoses reached in clinical investigations. A previously described real-time PCR (qPCR), targeting the A. salmonicida A-layer gene (vapA), was modified and validated for specific and sensitive detection of all presently recognized A-layer types of this bacterium. Before stocking and during episodes of increased mortality in salmon cages, cleaner fish (primarily wild-caught wrasse) were sampled and screened for A. salmonicida by qPCR and culture. Culture indicated that systemic bacterial infections are mainly contracted after salmon farm stocking, and qPCR revealed A. salmonicida prevalences of approximately 4% and 68% in pre- and post-stocked cleaner fish, respectively. This underpins A. salmonicida's relevance as a contributing factor to cleaner fish mortality and emphasizes the need for implementation of preventive measures (e.g. vaccination) if current levels of cleaner fish use are to be continued or expanded.",0
"Since 2008, the emergent virus OsHV-1microvar has provoked massive mortality events in Crassostrea gigas spat and juveniles in France. Since 2012, mortality driven by the pathogenic bacteria Vibrio aestuarianus has stricken market-sized adults. A hypothesis to explain the sudden increase in mortality observed in France since 2012 is that selective pressure due to recurrent viral infections could have led to a higher susceptibility of adults to Vibrio infection. In our study, two OsHV-1-resistant lines (AS and BS) and their respective controls (AC and BC) were experimentally challenged in the laboratory to determine their level of susceptibility to V. aestuarianus infection. At the juvenile stage, the selected lines exhibited lower mortality (14 and 33%) than the control lines (71 and 80%), suggesting dual-resistance to OsHV-1 and V. aestuarianus in C. gigas. Interestingly, this pattern was not observed at the adult stage, where higher mortality was detected for AS (68%) and BC (62%) than AC (39%) and BS (49%). These results were confirmed by the analysis of the expression of 31 immune-related genes in unchallenged oysters. Differential gene expression discriminated oysters according to their susceptibility to infection at both the juvenile and adult stages, suggesting that resistance to V. aestuarianus infection resulted in complex interactions between the genotype, stage of development and immunity status. Finally, survivors of the V. aestuarianus challenge at the juvenile stage still exhibited significant mortality at the adult stage during a second and third V. aestuarianus challenge, indicating that these survivors were not genetically resistant.",0
"The efficiency of Ovaprim salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) and dopamine antagonist on the induction of spawning and spermiation in Prochilodus lineatus in comparison with the commonly used method using pituitary extract (PE) was evaluated. Females received PE at 0.5 + 5.0 mg/kg and Ovaprim at 0.05 + 0.45 ml/kg or at 0.125 + 0.375 ml/kg. All males received a first dose of PE at 0.4 mg/kg and then PE at 4.0 mg/kg or Ovaprim at 0.25 ml/kg. Oocyte, egg, larvae and sperm quality were evaluated. All females spawned and oocyte, egg and larvae quality were similar between Ovaprim-treated (both doses) and PE-treated females. Data from females were pooled and the mean values were: 242 g ova weight, 15% ova index, 1209 oocytes/g ova, 284,539 oocytes/female, 183 oocytes/g body weight, 1.18 mm oocyte diameter, 49% fertilization rate, 43% hatching rate and 89% normal larvae. Sperm quality was similar between Ovaprim-treated and PE-treated males. Data from males were pooled and the mean values of semen were: volume of 3.0 ml, 14.9 x 109 sperm/ml, osmolality of 283 mOsm/kg, pH of 7.4, 71% motile sperm, 217 mum/s curvilinear velocity, 102 mum/s straight-line velocity and 189 mum/s average path velocity. Ovaprim treatment can be used for commercial reproduction of P. lineatus, without any loss of gamete quality in comparison with PE treatment.",0
"Selective breeding practices in Atlantic salmon aquaculture have been carried out intensively since the 1970s. Along with the phenotypic improvement of fish, we expect to observe genomic regions showing evidence of selection for traits related to growth and age at sexual maturation, as well as traits involved in the domestication process. This is mainly linked to the increase in the frequency of favourable alleles at loci that affect the traits of interest in the breeding population. In this study we searched for signatures of selection in the Cermaq Atlantic salmon broodstock, a Mowi strain, which was derived from wild Norwegian populations, and is now farmed in British Columbia, Canada. A 6.5K SNP array was used to genotype 202 fish from the Cermaq population, and the genotypes were compared with four wild populations from Norway. We used three methods based on FST values to detect signatures of selection. Forty four markers showing divergence in allele frequency were identified as outliers by the three detection methods, suggesting the presence of signatures of selection in the Cermaq population relative to their wild counterparts. Markers identified as outliers are associated with molecular functions that could be related to the selection for economically important traits (e.g., growth) as well as the domestication process (e.g., response to pathogens and environmental stressors). Of particular interest were three outlier markers that had been previously associated with grilsing (i.e., early sexual maturation) an undesirable trait, which has been heavily selected against in Atlantic salmon aquaculture. This study provides clear evidence of the presence of signatures of selection and domestication in a farmed Atlantic salmon population.",0
"UNLABELLED: In the summer of 2010, Vibrio parahaemolyticus caused an outbreak in Maryland linked to the consumption of oysters. Strains isolated from both stool and oyster samples were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). However, the oysters contained other potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains exhibiting different PFGE patterns. In order to assess the identity, genetic makeup, relatedness, and potential pathogenicity of the V. parahaemolyticus strains, we sequenced 11 such strains (2 clinical strains and 9 oyster strains). We analyzed these genomes by in silico multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and determined their phylogeny using a whole-genome MLST (wgMLST) analysis. Our in silico MLST analysis identified six different sequence types (STs) (ST8, ST676, ST810, ST811, ST34, and ST768), with both of the clinical and four of the oyster strains being identified as belonging to ST8. Using wgMLST, we showed that the ST8 strains from clinical and oyster samples were nearly indistinguishable and belonged to the same outbreak, confirming that local oysters were the source of the infections. The remaining oyster strains were genetically diverse, differing in >3,000 loci from the Maryland ST8 strains. eBURST analysis comparing these strains with strains of other STs available at the V. parahaemolyticus MLST website showed that the Maryland ST8 strains belonged to a clonal complex endemic to Asia. This indicates that the ST8 isolates from clinical and oyster sources were likely not endemic to Maryland. Finally, this study demonstrates the utility of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and associated analyses for source-tracking investigations. IMPORTANCE: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an important foodborne pathogen and the leading cause of bacterial infections in the United States associated with the consumption of seafood. In the summer of 2010, Vibrio parahaemolyticus caused an outbreak in Maryland linked to oyster consumption. Strains isolated from stool and oyster samples were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The oysters also contained other potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains with different PFGE patterns. Since their identity, genetic makeup, relatedness, and potential pathogenicity were unknown, their genomes were determined by using next-generation sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis by whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) allowed (i) identification of clinical and oyster strains with matching PFGE profiles as belonging to ST8, (ii) determination of oyster strain diversity, and (iii) identification of the clinical strains as belonging to a clonal complex (CC) described only in Asia. Finally, WGS and associated analyses demonstrated their utility for trace-back investigations.",0
"Epizootic epitheliotropic disease virus (EEDV; salmonid herpesvirus [SalHV3]; family Alloherpesviridae) causes a systemic disease of juvenile and yearling Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush. No cell lines are currently available for the culture and propagation of EEDV, so primary diagnosis is limited to PCR and electron microscopy. To better understand the pervasiveness of EEDV (carrier or latent state of infection) in domesticated and wild Lake Trout populations, we developed a sensitive TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect the presence of the EEDV terminase gene in Lake Trout tissues. This assay was able to detect a linear standard curve over nine logs of plasmid dilution and was sensitive enough to detect single-digit copies of EEDV. The efficiency of the PCR assay was 99.4 +/- 0.06% (mean +/- SD), with a 95% confidence limit of 0.0296 (R(2) = 0.994). Methods were successfully applied to collect preliminary data from a number of species and water bodies in the states of Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont, indicating that EEDV is more common in wild fish than previously known. In addition, through the development of this qPCR assay, we detected EEDV in a new salmonid species, the Cisco Coregonus artedi. The qPCR assay was unexpectedly able to detect two additional herpesviruses, the Atlantic Salmon papillomatosis virus (ASPV; SalHV4) and the Namaycush herpesvirus (NamHV; SalHV5), which both share high sequence identity with the EEDV terminase gene. With these unexpected findings, we subsequently designed three primer sets to confirm initial TaqMan qPCR assay positives and to differentiate among EEDV, ASPV, and NamHV by detecting the glycoprotein genes via SYBR Green qPCR.

"This study aims to identify at the expression level the immune-related genes associated with IPN-susceptible and resistant phenotypes in Atlantic salmon full-sibling families. We have analyzed thirty full-sibling families infected by immersion with IPNV and then classified as resistant or susceptible using a multivariate survival analysis based on a gamma-Cox frailty model and the Kaplan-Meier mortality curves. In four families within each group head kidneys were pooled for real-time PCR and one-color salmon-specific oligonucleotide microarray (21K) analysis at day 1 and 5 post-infection. Transcripts involved in innate response (IL-6, IFN-alpha), antigen presentation (HSP-70, HSP-90, MHC-I), TH1 response (IL-12, IFN-gamma, CRFB6), immunosuppression (IL-10, TGF-beta1) and leukocyte activation and migration (CCL-19, CD18) showed a differential expression pattern between both phenotypes, except in IL-6. In susceptible families, except for IFN-gamma, the expressions dropped to basal values at day 5 post-infection. In resistant families, unlike susceptible families, levels remained high or increased (except for IL-6) at day 5. Transcriptomic analysis showed that both families have a clear differential expression pattern, resulting in a marked down-regulation in immune related genes involved in innate response, complement system, antigen recognition and activation of immune response in IPN-resistant. Down-regulation of genes, mainly related to tissue differentiation and protein degradation metabolism, was also observed in resistant families. We have identified an immune-related gene patterns associated with susceptibility and resistance to IPNV infection of Atlantic salmon. This suggests that a limited immune response is associated with resistant fish phenotype to IPNV challenge while a highly inflammatory but short response is associated with susceptibility.",0
"Predicting microbial safety of fresh products in modified atmosphere packaging implies to take into account the dynamic of O2, CO2 and N2 exchanges in the system and its effect on microbial growth. In this paper a mechanistic model coupling gas transfer and predictive microbiology was validated using dedicated challenge-tests performed on poultry meat, fresh salmon and processed cheese, inoculated with either Listeria monocytogenes or Pseudomonas fluorescens and packed in commercially used packaging materials (tray + lid films). The model succeeded in predicting the relative variation of O2, CO2 and N2 partial pressure in headspace and the growth of the studied microorganisms without any parameter identification. This work highlighted that the respiration of the targeted microorganism itself and/or that of the naturally present microflora could not be neglected in most of the cases, and could, in the particular case of aerobic microbes contribute to limit the growth by removing all residual O2 in the package. This work also confirmed the low sensitivity of L. monocytogenes toward CO2 while that of P. fluorescens permitted to efficiently prevent its growth by choosing the right combination of packaging gas permeability value and initial % of CO2 initially flushed in the pack.",0
"The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of enterocin AS-48 to control Listeria monocytogenes in fish during storage at 4 √ÅC. AS-48 (0.37 mug/cm2) was tested singly and in combination with phage P100 (2.3 * 107 PFU/cm2) on a cocktail of 103 CFU/cm2L. monocytogenes strains inoculated in fillet tissues of raw hake and salmon and in smoked salmon. In raw fish, AS-48 alone reduced listeria with respect to the untreated control by 1.68, 2.79, 2.9, and 3.13 log CFU/cm2 (in hake) and by 1.9, 2.55, 2.8, and 2.8 (in salmon) at 1, 2, 3, and 7 d, respectively. Phage P100 treatment also yields significant reductions (but lower than AS-48) in listeria counts in both raw fishes. A combined treatment of AS-48/P100 eliminated listeria from hake and salmon fillets from 2 and 1 days respectively. In smoked salmon, AS-48 reduced listeria by 2, 3.4, 4.5, 4.25, and 4.25 log CFU/cm2 with respect to the control at 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 d, respectively. P100 treatment also reduced listeria counts but in lesser quantities than AS-48. A combined treatment of AS-48/P100 reduced listeria below detection levels from 1 to 15 d; afterwards, a slight listeria reactivation was detected. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"In fish, the innate immune system is the primary response against infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and some target molecules of TLRs are homologous between fish and mammals. Piscirickettsia salmonis is one of the main pathogens affecting the salmon industry in Chile. Better knowledge of mechanisms underlying its invasive capacity and recognition of target cells is crucial for vaccine development. Therefore, Salmo salar L. TLR1, TLR22, membrane TLR5M and soluble TLR5S sequences were cloned, and expression kinetics were analysed by RT-qPCR in salmon head kidney cells (SHK-1) infected with three different P. salmonis preparations: alive, formaldehyde treated, extract. Clearly, all analysed TLRs were expressed and transcription level changes were revealed at 2 hpi, 12 or 16 hpi and 24 hpi depending on P. salmonis infection scheme. Increased IL1-beta expression confirmed TLR pathway response. Furthermore, significant expression modulations of several members of the TLR pathway in this in vitro model suggest that P. salmonis extract rather than formaldehyde-inactivated bacteria might strengthen the salmon immune system.",0
"UNLABELLED: Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide results in ocean acidification and warming, significantly impacting marine invertebrate larvae development. We investigated how ocean acidification in combination with warming affected D-veliger larvae of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. Larvae were reared for 40h under either control (pH8.1, 20 degrees C), acidified (pH7.9, 20 degrees C), warm (pH8.1, 22 degrees C) or warm acidified (pH7.9, 22 degrees C) conditions. Larvae in acidified conditions were significantly smaller than in the control, but warm acidified conditions mitigated negative effects on size, and increased calcification. A proteomic approach employing two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to quantify proteins and relate their abundance to phenotypic traits. In total 12 differentially abundant spots were identified by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. These proteins had roles in metabolism, intra- and extra-cellular matrix formations, stress response, and as molecular chaperones. Seven spots responded to reduced pH, four to increased temperature, and six to acidification and warming. Reduced abundance of proteins such as ATP synthase and GAPDH, and increased abundance of superoxide dismutase, occurred when both pH and temperature changes were imposed, suggesting altered metabolism and enhanced oxidative stress. These results identify key proteins that may be involved in the acclimation of C. gigas larvae to ocean acidification and warming. SIGNIFICANCE: Increasing atmospheric CO2 raises sea surface temperatures and results in ocean acidification, two climatic variables known to impact marine organisms. Larvae of calcifying species may be particularly at risk to such changing environmental conditions. The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is ecologically and commercially important, and understanding its ability to acclimate to climate change will help to predict how aquaculture of this species is likely to be impacted. Modest, yet realistic changes in pH and/or temperature may be more informative of how populations will respond to contemporary climate change. We showed that concurrent acidification and warming mitigates the negative effects of pH alone on size of larvae, but proteomic analysis reveals altered patterns of metabolism and an increase in oxidative stress suggesting non-additive effects of the interaction between pH and temperature on protein abundance. Thus, even small changes in climate may influence development, with potential consequences later in life.",1
"Sample preparation has recently been an issue in the detection of food poisoning pathogens, particularly viruses such as norovirus (NoV), in food because of the complexity of foods and raw fresh materials. Here, we demonstrate a total analytical microfluidic chip module to automatically perform a series of essential processes (cell concentration, lysis (RNA extraction), nucleic acid amplification, and detection) for the fast but sensitive detection of norovirus in oysters. The murine NoV spiked oyster was stomached using a standard method. The supernatant was first loaded into a shape switchable sample preparation chamber consisting of charge switchable micro-beads. Murine NoV, which was adsorbed on microbeads by electrostatic physisorption, was lysed using bead beating. The extracted RNA was transferred to the detection chamber to be amplified using Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA). The optimal surface functionality, size, and number of microbeads were achieved for the virus concentration and the stable RNA extraction in the shape-switchable micro-channel. As a result, murine NoV in a single oyster was successfully detected within 4h by the microfluidic chip developed here, and could be directly applied to the large volume environmental sample as well as the food sample.",0
"Seaweeds have great potential as feed ingredients for fish farming, though their effects on the fatty acid content and profile of fish flesh are not well established. Recent studies suggest that seaweed supplementation can increase the concentration of long chain omega-3 PUFA (LC n-3 PUFAs) in various animal species, though this effect has never been assessed in salmon. Primarily, this study compared the fatty acid profiles of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that were fed a high quality diet containing seaweed (Diet A), with those on a high quality control diet without seaweed (Diet B). In addition, fatty acid profiles of Atlantic salmon that were fed a standard industrial quality diet containing seaweed (Diet C), were compared to those on a similar diet without seaweed (Diet D). Total fatty acid concentrations were significantly higher (+30%, p<0.05) in the flesh of the fish that were fed seaweed. Flesh concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA were 30% and 62% higher (p<0.05) in Diet A and Diet C groups compared to salmon in Diet B and Diet D groups respectively. Analysis of the fish lipid revealed no significant differences in LC-3 PUFAs between the high quality diet groups, while significantly higher (+ 45%, p<0.005) concentrations EPA + DHA were found in fish that consumed Diet C compared to Diet D. These findings support the hypothesis that the inclusion of seaweed in fish farm diets alters lipid partitioning and profiles of Atlantic salmon. Practical Applications. This study reveals a possible way to substantially increase EPA and DHA concentrations in farmed salmon. Both EPA and DHA are LC n-3 PUFAs and are essential components of the human diet. Unfortunately, consumption of such PUFAs is generally below RDI levels, which is in turn linked to several non-communicable diseases. Moreover, EPA + DHA concentrations in farmed salmon are now declining due to the replacement of scarce fish oils (rich in LC n-3 PUFA) by more sustainable plant-based oils (low in EPA + DHA) in fish feeds. Since salmon is one of the world's most consumed fish and one of the few major sources of LC n-3 PUFAs, it is of great importance to maintain or increase EPA + DHA levels in farmed salmon. The results of this study show that this could be achieved by dietary inclusion of seaweed.Seaweed can increase LC n-3 PUFA levels in salmon. ¬© 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",0
"Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is a salmon pathogen causing serious outbreaks in fish farms world-wide. There is currently no effective commercially available vaccine and there is a need for better understanding of host pathogen interactions with this virus. Various strains can cause both acute and persistent infections and therefore establish a balance with the host immune responses. We have studied host responses to this infection by analyzing the main branches of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in salmon cells in vitro and in tissues from infected fish to gain a better understanding of virus-host interactions. ISAV induce the main symptoms and signaling pathways of UPR (ATF6, PERK and IRE1) without inducing translational attenuation. This may be due to concomitant induction of an important negative feedback loop via the phosphatase regulator GADD34. The host cells can therefore respond with translation of cytokine and antiviral proteins to curb or control infection.",0
"Bioaccessibility describes the fraction of contaminants released from the food matrix into the digestive tracts of humans, which is beneficial for improving the health risk assessment of contaminants. In this study, the bioaccessibilities of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in two severely contaminated green oyster (Crassostrea angulate) and blue oyster (Crassostrea hongkongensis) populations were investigated. A human health risk assessment of these metals was then performed based on bioaccessibility measurements. Among the three metals, the bioaccessibility was the highest for Cu (42-95%), and Cd and Zn had comparable bioaccessibility (13-58%). There was no major difference in the bioaccessibility between green and blue oysters. A significant correlation between the tissue Cu and Zn concentrations was found in these highly contaminated oysters. A health risk assessment showed that all three metals in both oyster species seriously exceeded the levels recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, oysters from these locations, and the metals contained therein, presented quite high risks for human consumption, which should be a great cause of concern. A significant relationship was only found between metal bioaccessibility and its tissue concentration instead of between metal bioaccessibility and subcellular distribution. In addition, a significant relationship was only observed between metal health risks and its tissue concentration. The influence of metal bioaccessibilities on the health risks was limited. This may suggest that in the case of the colored oysters examined in this study, metal concentration instead of metal subcellular distribution could be the driving factor of the metal bioaccessibility, and metal concentration, instead of metal bioaccessibility, could be the driving factor of the metal health risks.",1
"The opportunistic pathogen Vibrio vulnificus occurs naturally in estuarine habitats and is readily cultured from water and oysters under warm conditions but infrequently at ambient conditions of <15 degrees C. The presence of V. vulnificus in other habitats, such as sediments and aquatic vegetation, has been explored much less frequently. This study investigated the ecology of V. vulnificus in water by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR) and in sediment, oysters, and aquatic vegetation by culture. V. vulnificus samples were taken from five sites around Tampa Bay, FL. Levels determined by qPCR and culture were significantly correlated (P = 0.0006; r = 0.352); however, V. vulnificus was detected significantly more frequently by qPCR (85% of all samples) compared to culture (43%). Culturable V. vulnificus bacteria were recovered most frequently from oyster samples (70%), followed by vegetation and sediment ( approximately 50%) and water (43%). Water temperature, which ranged from 18.5 to 33.4 degrees C, was positively correlated with V. vulnificus concentrations in all matrices but sediments. Salinity, which ranged from 1 to 35 ppt, was negatively correlated with V. vulnificus levels in water and sediments but not in other matrices. Significant interaction effects between matrix and temperature support the hypothesis that temperature affects V. vulnificus concentrations differently in different matrices and that sediment habitats may serve as seasonal reservoirs for V. vulnificus. V. vulnificus levels in vegetation have not been previously measured and reveal an additional habitat for this autochthonous estuarine bacterium.",0
"Junctional adhesion molecule (JAM), a subfamily of immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) with a couple of immunoglobulin domains, can act as regulator in homeostasis and inflammation of vertebrates. In the present study, a structural homolog of JAM-A (designated CgJAM-A-L) was screened out from oyster, Crassostrea gigas, through a search of JAM-A D1 domain (N-terminal Ig domain in JAM-A). The cDNA of CgJAM-A-L was of 1188 bp encoding a predicted polypeptide of 395 amino acids. The immunoreactive area of CgJAM-A-L mainly distributed over the plasma membrane of hemocytes. After Vibro splendidus or tumor necrosis factor (CgTNF-1) stimulation, the mRNA transcripts of CgJAM-A-L in hemocytes increased significantly by 4.46-fold and 9.00-fold (p < 0.01) of those in control group, respectively. The recombinant CgJAM-A-L protein (rCgJAM-A-L) could bind multiple PAMPs including lipopolysaccharides (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), mannose (MAN), beta-glucan (GLU) and poly(I:C), and various microorganisms including Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Vibro anguillarum, V. splendidus, Pastoris pastoris and Yarrowia lipolytica. The phagocytic rates of oyster hemocytes towards Gram-negative bacteria V. anguillarum and yeast P. pastoris were significantly enhanced after the incubation of rCgJAM-A-L, and even increased more significantly after the pre-incubation of rCgJAM-A-L with microbes (p < 0.01). The results collectively indicated that CgJAM-A-L functioned as an important pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and opsonin in the immune defense against invading pathogen in oyster. Moreover, as the most primitive specie with homolog of JAMs, the information of CgJAM-A-L in oyster would provide useful clues for the evolutionary study of JAMs and immunoglobulins.",0
"Wild-caught marine fish are potentially carrying parasites. Larvae of the nematode Anisakis simplex (herring or whale worm) occur in almost all commercially exploited fish stocks in temperate seas. The presence of A. simplex in fish and fish products is not only an economic concern but represents a significant consumer health risk. Anisakiasis, human infection with live larvae, can occur by consuming raw or undercooked fish while allergy symptoms can also be elicited by the presence of A. simplex proteins in processed seafood. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has concluded in a scientific opinion that routine testing of seafood products for A. simplex is needed. In the present study, we have determined A. simplex proteins in farmed salmon intended for use in sushi and fish products from the Norwegian market by quantitative sandwich ELISA, immunostaining and mass spectrometry. Analytical methods detecting anisakid proteins at the single-digit milligram level appear to be sufficiently sensitive for the protection of allergic consumers. Only trace amounts (<10 mg/kg) were detected in a few samples showing that contamination with A. simplex is apparently not an immediate health problem given the results from this survey.

"Fish by-products are considered low value and discarded. With proper handling and processing, fish by-products may provide high nutritional value to consumers. This study aimed at establishing compositional differences in valuable compounds from fish by-products of selected species, including Salmon, Flathead, Silver warehou and Barramundi. Simple extraction methods were employed, and obtained fractions were analysed for their chemical and physical properties. The chemical composition of four fish species differed significantly (P < 0.05) with the protein content ranging from 14.7 0.09 to 16.8 0.41%. Adjusting pH to 2.5 yielded two times more of extracted oil than at pH 4.5. Salmon and Barramundi oils contained high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (39-50%), while Silver warehou and Flathead oils contained 46-49% of saturated fatty acids (SFAs). The particle size of the protein fractions was small, ranging from 126.9 to 489.5 nm. Molecular weight of extracted proteins was fish species dependant - Silver warehou and Barramundi samples contained proteins of 250, 120 and 100 kDa, while these bands were absent from Salmon and Flathead samples. The data obtained indicate that extracted fractions from fish by-products likely have high nutritional value and could find a potential use in food formulations. 2015 Institute of Food Science and Technology.",0
"Vibrio vulnificus strains were isolated from oysters that were collected at the main seafood market in Mexico City. Strains were characterized with regard to vvhA, vcg genotype, PFGE, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and rtxA1. Analyses included a comparison with rtxA1 reference sequences. Environmental (vcgE) and clinical (vcgC) genotypes were isolated at nearly equal percentages. PFGE had high heterogeneity, but the strains clustered by vcgE or vcgC genotype. Select housekeeping genes for MLST and primers that were designed for rtxA1 domains divided the strains into two clusters according to the E or C genotype. Reference rtxA1 sequences and those from this study were also clustered according to genotype. These results confirm that this genetic dimorphism is not limited to vcg genotyping, as other studies have reported. Some environmental C genotype strains had high similarity to reference strains, which have been reported to be virulent, indicating a potential risk for oyster consumers in Mexico City.",1
"In this paper, the authors provide data on a culinary-medicinal, host-specific variety of P. eryngii species-complex that is known in Italy as ""cardoncello"". A species description, the techniques of isolation of a new strain (C-142-c), and the preparation of the substratum are illustrated. Data on the productivity of substratum inoculated with C-142-c strain and the nutritional value of cultivated ""cardoncello"" mushrooms are also provided.",0
"Mollusc larvae have a stable, velum-up orientation that may influence how they sense and react to hydrodynamic signals applied in different directions. Directional sensing abilities and responses could affect how a larva interacts with anisotropic fluid motions, including those in feeding currents and in boundary layers encountered during settlement. Oyster larvae (Crassostrea virginica) were exposed to simple shear in a Couette device and to solid-body rotation in a single rotating cylinder. Both devices were operated in two different orientations, one with the axis of rotation parallel to the gravity vector, and one with the axis perpendicular. Larvae and flow were observed simultaneously with near-infrared particle-image velocimetry, and behaviors were quantified as a response to strain rate, vorticity, and centripetal acceleration. Only flows rotating about a horizontal axis elicited the diving response observed previously for oyster larvae in turbulence. The results provide strong evidence that the turbulence-sensing mechanism relies on gravity-detecting organs (statocysts) rather than mechanosensors (cilia). Flow sensing with statocysts sets oyster larvae apart from zooplankters such as copepods and protists that use external mechanosensors in sensing spatial velocity gradients generated by prey or predators. Sensing flow-induced changes in orientation, rather than flow deformation, would enable more efficient control of vertical movements. Statocysts provide larvae with a mechanism of maintaining their upward swimming when rotated by vortices and initiating dives toward the seabed in response to the strong turbulence associated with adult habitats.",0
"Adjuvants used in vaccine aquaculture are frequently harmful for the fish, causing melanosis, granulomas and kidney damage. Along with that, vaccines are mostly administered by injection, causing pain and stress to the fish. We used the DNA coding for the replicase of alphavirus as adjuvant (Ad) of a vaccine against ISAV. The Ad and an inactivated ISAV (V) were loaded in chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) to be administered orally to Atlantic salmon. NP-Ad was able to deliver the DNA ex vivo and in vivo. Oral administration of the NPs stimulated the expression of immune molecules, but did not stimulate the humoral response. Although the vaccination with NP-V results in a modest protection of fish against ISAV, NP-V administered together with NP-Ad caused a protection of 77%. Therefore, the DNA coding for the replicase of alphavirus could be administered orally and can potentiate the immuneprotection of a virine against infection.",0
"Noroviruses are the most common causative agent of viral gastroenteritis in humans, and are responsible for major foodborne illnesses in the United States. Filter-feeding molluscan shellfish exposed to sewage-contaminated waters bioaccumulate viruses, and if consumed raw, transmit the viruses to humans and cause illness. We investigated the occurrence of norovirus GI and GII and microbial indicators of fecal contamination in the eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and water from commercial harvesting areas along the Louisiana Gulf Coast (January to November of 2013). Microbial indicators (aerobic plate count, enterococci, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, male-specific coliphages, and somatic coliphages) were detected at the densities lower than public health concerns. Only one oyster sample was positive for norovirus GII at 3.5 +/- 0.2 log10 genomic equivalent copies/g digestive tissues. A stool specimen obtained from an infected individual associated with a norovirus outbreak and the suspected oysters (Cameron Parish, La., area 30, January 2013) were also analyzed. The norovirus strain in the stool belonged to GII.4 Sydney; however, the oysters were negative and could not be linked. In general, no temporal trend was observed in the microbial indicators. Low correlation among bacterial indicators was observed in oysters. Strongest correlations among microbial indicators were observed between enterococci and fecal coliforms (r = 0.63) and between enterococci and E. coli (r = 0.64) in water (P < 0.05); however, weak correlations were found in oysters (r < 0.45) and between oysters and harvest water (r </= 0.36, P > 0.05). Our results emphasize the need for regular monitoring of pathogenic viruses in commercial oyster harvesting areas to reduce the risks of viral gastroenteritis incidences.",1
"Past studies disagree on the extent to which dissolved or dietary uptake contribute to metal bioaccumulation in the filter-feeding Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) in urbanized estuaries. Although most data support the assumption that fine sediments are a major route of metal uptake in these bivalves, some studies based in the Sydney estuary, Australia, have indicated a poor correlation. In the present study, seawater, sediment and microalgae were radiolabelled with (65)Zn tracer and exposed to S. glomerata to assess the influence of dissolved and dietary sources to Zn bioaccumulation. Oysters in the dissolved-phase uptake experiment (5, 25 and 50 mug L(-1) (65)Zn for 4 d followed by 21 days of depuration) readily accumulated (65)Zn for all three concentrations with an uptake rate constant of 0.160+/-0.006 L dry weight g(-1) d(-1). Oysters in the dietary assimilation experiment (1h pulse-feed of either (65)Zn-radiolabelled suspended fine-fraction (<63 mum) sediment or the microalgae Tetraselmis sp.) accumulated (65)Zn, with assimilation efficiencies of 59 and 67% for fine sediment and microalgae, respectively. The efflux rates were low for the three experiments (0.1-0.5% d(-1)). A bioaccumulation kinetic model predicts that uptake of Zn will occur predominantly through the dietary ingestion of contaminated fine sediment particles and microalgae within the water column, with considerably greater metal bioaccumulation predicted if oysters ingested microalgae preferentially to sediments. However, the model predicts that for dissolved Zn concentrations greater than 40 mug L(-1), as observed during precipitation events, the uptake of the dissolved phase may contribute >/=50% to accumulation. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that all three sources may be important exposure routes to S. glomerata under different environmental conditions, but contributions from dietary exposure will often dominate.",0
"Laboratory and field trials evaluated the efficacy of three methods of detecting aquatic pesticide concentrations. Currently used pesticides: atrazine, metolachlor, and diazinon and legacy pesticide dieldrin were targeted. Pesticides were extracted using solid-phase extraction (SPE) of water samples, titanium plate passive samplers coated in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) and eastern oysters (Crassostrea viginica) as biosamplers. A laboratory study assessed the extraction efficiencies and precision of each method. Passive samplers yielded the highest precision of the three methods (RSD: 3-14% EVA plates; 19-60% oysters; and 25-56% water samples). Equilibrium partition coefficients were derived. A significant relationship was found between the concentration in oyster tissue and the ambient aquatic concentration. In the field (Housatonic River, CT (U.S.)) water sampling (n = 5) detected atrazine at 1.61-7.31 mug L(-1), oyster sampling (n = 2x15) detected dieldrin at n.d.-0.096 mug L(-1) SW and the passive samplers (n = 5x3) detected atrazine at 0.97-3.78 mug L(-1) SW and dieldrin at n.d.-0.68 mug L(-1) SW.",0
"Pancreas disease (PD), caused by a salmonid alphavirus (SAV), has a large negative economic and animal welfare impact on Atlantic salmon aquaculture. Evidence for genetic variation in host resistance to this disease has been reported, suggesting that selective breeding may potentially form an important component of disease control. The aim of this study was to explore the genetic architecture of resistance to PD, using survival data collected from two unrelated populations of Atlantic salmon; one challenged with SAV as fry in freshwater (POP 1) and one challenged with SAV as post-smolts in sea water (POP 2). Analyses of the binary survival data revealed a moderate-to-high heritability for host resistance to PD in both populations (fry POP 1 h(2)~0.5; post-smolt POP 2 h(2)~0.4). Subsets of both populations were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphism markers, and six putative resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified. One of these QTL was mapped to the same location on chromosome 3 in both populations, reaching chromosome-wide significance in both the sire- and dam-based analyses in POP 1, and genome-wide significance in a combined analysis in POP 2. This independently verified QTL explains a significant proportion of host genetic variation in resistance to PD in both populations, suggesting a common underlying mechanism for genetic resistance across lifecycle stages. Markers associated with this QTL are being incorporated into selective breeding programs to improve PD resistance.",0
"This study aimed to investigate the hygiene of edible raw aquatic products and to provide a theoretical basis for analysis and regulation of food safety in Shanghai. The contamination status of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in edible raw salmon was studied according to the national standard method GB/T 4789.7-2008. Ninety samples of edible raw salmon were collected from three wholesale markets in 2013, out of which, V. parahaemolyticus was detected in nineteen (20.00%) samples and the pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus was detected in one (1.10%) sample. Phylogenic analysis of 18 V. parahaemolyticus was conducted based on the nucleotide sequence data for the 16S rDNA gene using MEGA software. The risk of V. parahaemolyticus in edible raw salmon was analyzed by software @Risk 5.5, Beta-Poisson dose-response model and Monte Carlo simulation. The predicted probability of morbidity associated with the consumption of raw salmon contaminated by V. parahaemolyticus in Shanghai was 2.02 * 10-6, i.e. aproximately 2 cases out of every million people, and the number of patients infected due to the consumption of edible raw salmon contaminated by V. parahaemolyticus was 111 people each year according to the average total consumption of salmon. The health risk of consumption of raw salmon contaminated by V. parahaemolyticus in Shanghai was low. Controlling the level of V. parahaemolyticus in edible raw salmon and the amount of consumption is the key approach to reducing the health risk of consumption of raw salmon contaminated by V. parahaemolyticus.",0
"Twenty five Baltic wild salmon (Salmo salar) specimens were analysed for the content of Dechlorane-related compounds (DRCs). Out of the ten analysed DRCs, seven compounds were detected in the muscle tissues of salmon, including Dechlorane (Dec) 602, Dec 603, syn- and anti-stereoisomers of Dechlorane Plus (DP), Dechlorane Plus monoadduct (1,3-DPMA), hexachlorocyclopentadienyl-dibromocyclooctane (DBHCTD), and Mirex. The concentrations of Dec 604 and two DP dechlorinated compounds - decachloropentacyclooctadecadiene (Cl10DP) and undecachloropentacyclooctadecadiene (Cl11DP) - were below the limit of detection in all samples. The aggregated concentrations of DRCs (SigmaDRC) were in the range of 551-3339 pg g(-1) fresh weight (f.w.) with 1,3-DPMA being the predominant DRC component contributing up to 70% to the SigmaDRC. The fractional abundance of syn- and anti-DP stereoisomers showed a pronounced enrichment of anti-DP and was close to the composition of OxyChem((R)) DP commercial product. The obtained concentrations of DRCs were substantially lower than those reported in previous studies of biotic samples (among them fish, mollusks, white stork and peregrine falcon eggs) from inland freshwater reservoirs in more industrialised areas throughout Europe and North America. A statistically significant relationships between the concentrations of Dec 602 and the concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) was observed.",1
"Aquaculture is an extremely valuable and rapidly expanding sector of the seafood industry. The sediment below active aquaculture farms receives inputs of organic matter from uneaten food and faecal material and this has led to concerns related to environmental sustainability. The impacts of organic enrichment on macrobenthic infauna are well characterized; however, much less is known about effect on bacterial communities. In this study, sediment, macrobenthic infauna samples and environmental data were collected along an enrichment gradient radiating out from a Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farm (Marlborough Sounds; New Zealand). DNA and RNA were extracted and 16S rRNA metabarcodes from bacterial communities characterized using high-throughput sequencing. Desulfobacterales dominated at the cage (DNA and RNA), and at sites 50 m (DNA and RNA) and 150 m (RNA) from the farm. In contrast, unclassified bacteria from the class Gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant taxa at control sites (625 and 4000 m). Pronounced differences among DNA and RNA samples occurred at the cage site where Desulfobacterales abundance was markedly higher in RNA samples. There were strong correlations between shifts in bacterial communities and total organic matter and redox. This suggests that bacterial composition is strongly influenced by organic enrichment, a trait that may make them useful for assessing impacts associated with aquaculture farms.",1
"This paper stresses on the synthesis, characterization of novel carboxylic acid derivative and its application in pharmaceutics. Carboxylic acid derivatives have a growing importance in medicine, particularly in oncology. A novel carboxylic acid, 4-(4-methoxy-2-nitrophenylamino)-4-oxobutanoic acid, was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR ((1)H, and (13)C), mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray structural analysis. The structure of the title compound, C11H12N2O6, shows the molecules dimerised by short intramolecular OHcdots, three dots, centeredO hydrogen bonds. The compound was screened for in vitro antimicrobial, anticancer, and antileishmanial activities as well as interaction with SS-DNA. The compound was also checked for in vitro anticancer activity against BHK-21, H-157 and HCEC cell lines, and showed significant anticancer activity. The compound was almost non-toxic towards human corneal epithelial cells (HCEC) and did not show more than 7.4% antiproliferative activity when used at the 2.0mug/mL end concentration. It was also tested for antileishmanial activity against the promastigote form of leishmania major and obtained attractive result. DNA interaction study exposes that the binding mode of the compound with SS-DNA is an intercalative as it results in hypochromism along with minor red shift. A new and efficient strategy to identify pharmacophores sites in carboxylic acid derivative for antibacterial/antifungal activity using Petra, Osiris and Molinspiration (POM) analyses was also carried out.",0
"Pancreas disease (PD) caused by salmonid alphavirus (SAV) has a significant negative economic impact in the salmonid fish farming industry in northern Europe. Until recently, only SAV subtype 3 was present in Norwegian fish farms. However, in 2011, a marine SAV 2 subtype was detected in a fish farm outside the PD-endemic zone. This subtype has spread rapidly among fish farms in mid-Norway. The PD mortality in several farms has been lower than expected, although high mortality has also been reported. In this situation, the industry and the authorities needed scientific-based information about the virulence of the marine SAV 2 strain in Norway to decide how to handle this new situation. Atlantic salmon post-smolts were experimentally infected with SAV 2 and SAV 3 strains from six different PD cases in Norway. SAV 3-infected fish showed higher mortality than SAV 2-infected fish. Among the SAV 3 isolates, two isolates gave higher mortality than the third one. At the end of the experiment, fish in all SAV-infected groups had significantly lower weight than the uninfected control fish. This is the first published paper on PD to document that waterborne infection produced significantly higher mortality than intraperitoneal injection.",0
"Increasing concern of consumers on the safety of synthetic food additives has created high interest in natural preservatives in food industry. Plant extracts produced by supercritical CO2 technology from rosemary (R), oregano (O) and an antimicrobial blend (AB) consisting of seven different plants were studied for their effects on lipid oxidation in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Fish pieces were marinated with rapeseed oil containing 0, 1, 2 or 4 g of plant extracts/kg of fish. After cooking the pieces were stored in refrigerator for 26 days. Peroxide values (PVs) were determined and oxidised triacylglycerols (TAGs) measured by UHPLC-ESI/MS at 0, 7, 14 and 26 days of storage. During the first two weeks of storage, AB delayed oxidation by at least one week compared to control samples as shown by PVs (<10 meq. O2) and by the oxidised TAGs. Oregano and rosemary showed also some antioxidative potential.",1
"Interactive effects of ocean acidification and ocean warming on marine calcifiers vary among species, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. The present study investigated the combined effects of seawater acidification and elevated temperature (ambient condition: pH 8.1 x 23 degrees C, stress conditions: pH 7.8 x 23 degrees C, pH 8.1 x 28 degrees C, and pH 7.8 x 28 degrees C, exposure time: two months) on the transcriptome and biomineralization of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata, which is an important marine calcifier. Transcriptome analyses indicated that P. fucata implemented a compensatory acid-base mechanism, metabolic depression and positive physiological responses to mitigate the effects of seawater acidification alone. These responses were energy-expensive processes, leading to decreases in the net calcification rate, shell surface calcium and carbon content, and changes in the shell ultrastructure. Elevated temperature (28 degrees C) within the thermal window of P. fucata did not induce significant enrichment of the sequenced genes and conversely facilitated calcification, which was detected to alleviate the negative effects of seawater acidification on biomineralization and the shell ultrastructure. Overall, this study will help elucidate the mechanisms by which pearl oysters respond to changing seawater conditions and predict the effects of global climate change on pearl aquaculture.",0
"The presence of norovirus in shellfish is a public health concern in Europe. Here, we report the results of an investigation into a norovirus gastroenteritis outbreak following a festive lunch which affected 84 (57%) residents and staff members of a nursing home in January 2012 in France. Individuals who had eaten oysters had a significantly higher risk of developing symptoms in the following 2.5 days than those who had not, the risk increasing with the amount eaten [relative risk 2.2 (1.0-4.6) and 3.3 (1.6-6.6) for 3-4 and 5-12 oysters, respectively]. In healthy individuals during those days, 29 (32%) subsequently became ill, most of whom were staff members performing activities in close contact with residents. Genogroup II noroviruses were detected in faecal samples, in a sample of uneaten oysters and in oysters from the production area. Identifying a norovirus's infectious dose may facilitate the health-related management of contaminated shellfish.",0
"The selective effect that refrigeration exerts on the autochthonous microbiota of the eastern oyster was investigated using culture-independent methods. Oysters from two different locations along the Gulf Coast of Mexico were analyzed concurrently during 2-week refrigeration. Ribosomal intergenic sequence analysis (RISA) generated complex bacterial community fingerprints that provided a strong association between RISA-defined clusters and sample date. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles obtained with universal primers did not reflect any association based on date or geographic origin of the samples. During the storage period, Vibrio parahaemolyticus was replaced, at least in overall abundance, with other nonpathogenic Vibrio species better adapted to cold temperatures. This study shows that refrigeration itself does not limit the growth of the bacterial community nor reduces its richness. Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",0
"A method was developed for the identification and quantification of oxytetracycline residues present in salmon muscle and skin using UV-Vis derivative spectrophotometry. With this method, it was possible to reduce the number of steps in the procedure typically required for instrumental analysis of a sample. The spectral variables, order of the derivative, scale factor, smoothing factor, and analytical wavelength were optimized using standard solutions of oxytetracycline dissolved in 900 mg/L oxalic acid in methanol. The matrix effect was significant; therefore, quantification for oxytetracycline residues was carried out using drug-free salmon muscle and skin samples fortified with oxytetracycline. The LOD and LOQ were found to be 271 and 903 mug/kg, respectively. The precision and accuracy of the method were validated using drug-free salmon muscle and skin tissues fortified at three different concentrations (8, 16, and 32 mg/kg) on 3 different days. The recoveries at all fortified concentrations were between 90 and 105%, and RSDs in all cases were less than 6.5%. This method can be used to screen out compliant samples and thereby reduce the number of suspect positive samples that will require further confirmatory analysis.",0
"Listeria monocytogenes is an important foodborne pathogen responsible for the disease listeriosis, and can be found throughout the environment, in many foods and in food processing facilities. The main cause of listeriosis is consumption of food contaminated from sources in food processing environments. Persistence in food processing facilities has previously been shown for the L. monocytogenes sequence type (ST) 8 subtype. In the current study, five ST8 strains were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and compared with five additionally available ST8 genomes, allowing comparison of strains from salmon, poultry and cheese industry, in addition to a human clinical isolate. Genome-wide analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) confirmed that almost identical strains were detected in a Danish salmon processing plant in 1996 and in a Norwegian salmon processing plant in 2001 and 2011. Furthermore, we show that L. monocytogenes ST8 was likely to have been transferred between two poultry processing plants as a result of relocation of processing equipment. The SNP data were used to infer the phylogeny of the ST8 strains, separating them into two main genetic groups. Within each group, the plasmid and prophage content was almost entirely conserved, but between groups, these sequences showed strong divergence. The accessory genome of the ST8 strains harbored genetic elements which could be involved in rendering the ST8 strains resilient to incoming mobile genetic elements. These included two restriction-modification loci, one of which was predicted to show phase variable recognition sequence specificity through site-specific domain shuffling. Analysis indicated that the ST8 strains harbor all important known L. monocytogenes virulence factors, and ST8 strains are commonly identified as the causative agents of invasive listeriosis. Therefore, the persistence of this L. monocytogenes subtype in food processing facilities poses a significant concern for food safety.",0
"In this study, the likelihood of introduction of anisakid larvae in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farms and subsequent commercialization of fish infected by at least one vital parasite was formally assessed using an adaptation of the risk assessment framework for importation of animals and animal products of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The different plausible pathways were identified and outlined. The most recent information concerning the parasite, its definitive, intermediate hosts and the farming practices typical of Atlantic salmon farms were reviewed and used to assess the likelihoods of each key step along the pathways. A matrix for the conditional probabilities was adopted to combine the qualitative estimations and obtain an objective and transparent overall risk of introduction along each route. In order to avoid misinterpretation and overconfidence on the outcome, the uncertainties surrounding the estimations were considered. The only situation for which the assessed risk in a typical Atlantic salmon farm was deemed to be non-negligible involved the ingestion of infected hosts that penetrate the harvesting cages. In this event, the overall risk was estimated as ""Very Low"" with a high degree of uncertainty because of the scarcity of information in some of the key steps along the pathway. However, the scientific evidence in support of the overall estimation suggests that the availability of additional data would be unlikely to increase the final estimated risk. On the basis of the available information of the system, the estimated risk of introduction and commercialization of farmed Atlantic salmons infected by viable nematodes resulted ""Very Low"" even under a conservative approach. The proposed qualitative model is an objective and transparent method to assess the risk when data and information are scarce and provides a framework for the qualitative assessment of the introduction of alive parasites in aquaculture/mariculture implants and subsequent commercialization of infested fishery products. The framework could be easily adapted to other parasite-host interactions besides anisakid nematodes in Farmed Atlantic salmons. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Antimicrobial resistance is a major global public health concern and a food safety issue considered in the framework of Horizon 2020. Bearing this in mind, the current study determined the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella strains isolated in ready-to-eat food sampled in industry and retail between 2006 and 2012 by the Official Food Control Services of the Valencian administration (Spain). The presence of L. monocytogenes was analysed in a total of 2864 samples including pasteurized cheese (624); cooked ham (487); dried pork sausages (192); ice cream (758) and smoked salmon (803). The presence of Salmonella was analysed in a total of 1264 samples: pasteurized cheese (289); cooked ham (316); dried pork sausages (78); ice cream (376) and smoked salmon (205). The results showed that L. monocytogenes was present in 3.8% of the samples, being most common in smoked salmon. Salmonella was not found in any of the products studied with the exception of 7 out 78 samples of dried pork sausage. Both L. monocytogenes and Salmonella showed resistance to 4 antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole). Moreover, the former was resistant to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and vancomycin while the later showed resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate and chloramphenicol. Furthermore, multi-resistance was found for both microorganisms. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"Predictive models offer efficient means to manage the quality and safety of highly perishable seafood. Salmon is an increasingly popular seafood, and relies on well managed domestic and international supply chains to minimize growth of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. While the literature describes predictive models for smoked and modified atmosphere packaged salmon, there are no reported models for spoilage bacteria and Listeria monocytogenes on head-on and gutted (HOG) aerobically-stored Atlantic salmon. Predictive models were developed for microbial and sensorial degradation of HOG Atlantic salmon stored at 0-15 degrees C until the end of shelf-life. Total Viable Count (TVC) and Pseudomonas spp. had similar growth rates at 0, 5 and 10 degrees C, but TVC rate was higher at 15 degrees C. L. monocytogenes growth rate at 0 degrees C was 0.004 log10 cfu/h, and showed a log-linear increase (R(2) = 0.99) to 0.079 log10 cfu/h at 15 degrees C. Sensory Quality Index (QI) scores were 2.4, 4.5, and 7.2 times greater at 5, 10 and 15 degrees C, respectively, compared to 0 degrees C. QI and TVC rates had a relatively strong relationship at 5 (R(2) = 0.87), 10 (R(2) = 0.80) and 15 degrees C (R(2) = 0.78), compared to 0 degrees C (R(2) = 0.50). These models are potential tools to manage the safety and quality of HOG Atlantic salmon in supply chains.",0
"Chilled fresh salmon fillets were used for the study; the differential prevalence of spoilage bacteria during storage at 0 √ÅC was analyzed by morphological observations and 16 S rDNA sequence analysis. In addition, the specific spoilage bacteria were separated and identified using the VITEK 2 automated microbial identification system. The major spoilage bacterial species identified in salmon fillets stored at 0 √ÅC during the start of storage (day 0) were Staphylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Pediococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Aeromonas sp., Carnobacterium sp., and Sphingomonas sp. The phase of spoilage bacteria gradually became unitary with the increase in storage time; a significant decrease was observed in the numbers of Staphylococcus sp., Pediococcus sp., and Micrococcus sp., whereas the Aeromonas sp. and Sphingomonas sp. disappeared completely over time. No significant changes were observed in the Carnobacterium sp; on the other hand, there was a gradual increase in the proportion of Pseudomonas sp., leading to its predominance during the end of the storage time. The sequences, amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), were compared against the sequences present in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database; the phylogenetic tree constructed using the MEGA 5.05 software was used for analysis, and the automated microbial identification system was utilized for all measurements. These results identified Pseudomonas fluorescens to be the dominant spoilage bacterium in refrigerated salmon fillets.",0
"Soy-seasoned salmon roe products are commonly eaten in Japan; long-term preservation of these items requires refrigeration. However, salmon roe products are often contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, which can potentially cause outbreaks of listeriosis. This study focused on developing a method to inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes in salmon roe products by treating these foodstuffs with a combination of nisin and commercial pectin-hydrolysate, Neupectin L. We determined that treatment with 0.5 mg g-1 nisin completely inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes in raw salmon roe. However, treatment with nisin alone did not inhibit L. monocytogenes in soy-seasoned salmon roes. Further work showed that combined treatment with 0.5 mg g-1 nisin and 0.5% Neupectin L completely inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes during incubation at 12√ÅC. Therefore, this combination is an alternative way to control L. monocytogenes growth in salmon roe products.",0
"Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is one of the major viral pathogens causing disease in farmed Atlantic salmon worldwide. In the present work we show that several of the IPN proteins have powerful antagonistic properties against type I IFN induction in Atlantic salmon. Each of the five IPNV genes cloned into an expression vector were tested for the ability to influence activation of the Atlantic salmon IFNa1 promoter by the interferon promoter inducing protein one (IPS-1) or interferon regulatory factors (IRF). This showed that preVP2, VP3 and VP5 inhibited activation of both promoters, while VP4 only antagonized activation of the IFNa1 promoter. The viral protease VP4 was the most potent inhibitor of IFN induction, apparently targeting the IRF1 and IRF3 branch of the signaling cascade. VP4 antagonism is independent of its protease activity since the catalytically dead mutant VP4K674A inhibited activation of the IFNa1 promoter to a similar extent as wild type VP4. In contrast to the other IPNV proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase VP1 activated the IFNa1 promoter. The ability to activate the IFN response was disrupted in the mutant VP1S163A, which has lost the ability to produce dsRNA. VP1 also exhibited synergistic effects with IRF1 and IRF3 in inducing an IFNa1-dependent antiviral state in cells. Taken together these results suggest that IPNV has developed multiple IFN antagonistic properties to prevent IFN-induction by VP1 and its dsRNA genome.",0
"The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is able to survive and grow in ready-to-eat foods, in which it is likely to experience a number of environmental stresses due to refrigerated storage and the physicochemical properties of the food. Little is known about the specific molecular mechanisms underlying survival and growth of L. monocytogenes under different complex conditions on/in specific food matrices. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to understand the transcriptional landscape of L. monocytogenes strain H7858 grown on cold smoked salmon (CSS; water phase salt, 4.65%; pH 6.1) relative to that in modified brain heart infusion broth (MBHIB; water phase salt, 4.65%; pH 6.1) at 7 degrees C. Significant differential transcription of 149 genes was observed (false-discovery rate [FDR], <0.05; fold change, >/=2.5), and 88 and 61 genes were up- and downregulated, respectively, in H7858 grown on CSS relative to the genes in H7858 grown in MBHIB. In spite of these differences in transcriptomes under these two conditions, growth parameters for L. monocytogenes were not significantly different between CSS and MBHIB, indicating that the transcriptomic differences reflect how L. monocytogenes is able to facilitate growth under these different conditions. Differential expression analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that genes encoding proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis as well as ethanolamine and 1,2-propanediol utilization have significantly higher transcript levels in H7858 grown on CSS than in that grown in MBHIB. Our data identify specific transcriptional profiles of L. monocytogenes growing on vacuum-packaged CSS, which may provide targets for the development of novel and improved strategies to control L. monocytogenes growth on this ready-to-eat food.",0
"Pharmaceuticals are pseudopersistent aquatic pollutants with unknown effects at environmentally relevant concentrations. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were exposed to Acetaminophen: 54.77 +/- 34.67; Atenolol: 11.08 +/- 7.98, and Carbamazepine: 7.85 +/- 0.13 mug.L(-1) for 5 days. After Acetaminophen treatment, 19 proteins were differently expressed, of which 11 were significant with respect to the control group (eight up-regulated and three down-regulated). After Atenolol treatment, seven differently expressed proteins were obtained in comparison with the control, of which six could be identified (four up-regulated and two down-regulated). Carbamazepine exposure resulted in 15 differently expressed proteins compared with the control, with 10 of them identified (seven up-regulated and three down-regulated). Out of these, three features were common between Acetaminophen and Carbamazepine and one between Carbamazepine and Atenolol. One feature was common across all treatments. Principal component analysis and heat map clustering showed a clear grouping of the variability caused by the applied treatments. The obtained data suggest (1) that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of the pharmaceuticals alters the hepatic protein expression profile of the Atlantic salmon; and (2) the existence of treatment specific processes that may be useful for biomarker development.",1
"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) was isolated from five species of wrasse (Labridae) used as biological controls for parasitic sea lice predominantly, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Kroyer, 1837), on marine Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., farms in Shetland. As part of the epidemiological investigation, 1400 wild marine fish were caught and screened in pools of 10 for VHSV using virus isolation. Eleven pools (8%) were confirmed VHSV positive from: grey gurnard, Eutrigla gurnardus L.; Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus L.; Norway pout, Trisopterus esmarkii (Nilsson); plaice, Pleuronectes platessa L.; sprat, Sprattus sprattus L. and whiting, Merlangius merlangus L. The isolation of VHSV from grey gurnard is the first documented report in this species. Nucleic acid sequencing of the partial nucleocapsid (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes was carried out for viral characterization. Sequence analysis confirmed that all wild isolates were genotype III the same as the wrasse and there was a close genetic similarity between the isolates from wild fish and wrasse on the farms. Infection from these local wild marine fish is the most likely source of VHSV isolated from wrasse on the fish farms.",1
"Bisphenol A (BPA) is regularly detected in aquatic ecosystems due to increased use of products based on polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. It migrates from these products directly into rivers and marine waters or indirectly through effluents from wastewater treatment plants and landfilled sites. BPA can affect aquatic organisms both chronically and acutely at sensitive live stages. Despite reports indicating harmful effects of BPA, little is known about its role in oxidative stress responses in fish. In this study, we investigated the transcriptional effect of BPA (0, 1, 10, 100 muM) on an Atlantic salmon kidney (ASK) cell line for 6 h and 24 h by monitoring expression of 11 genes: elongation factor 1-alpha (ef1a), 18S ribosomal RNA (18s), gluthation (gsh), superoxide dismutase (sod), thioredoxin (txd), Salmo salar oxidative stress-responsive serine-rich 1 (oxr), glucose-regulated protein 78 (grp78), heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), sequestosome1 (p62), interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta) and toll-like receptor 8 (tlr8). In general, only the 100 muM concentration treatment altered the mRNA expression. BPA down-regulated the expression of gsh and sod genes for both exposure-times while txd gene was the only down-regulated after 6-h exposure. The up-regulation of genes in the ASK cell line exposed for 6 h was only observed in il-1beta, while the 24-h exposure resulted in the up-regulation of oxr, tlr8, hsp70, p62 and il-1beta genes. The last three genes increased several fold compared to the others. The results showed that BPA exposure at 100 muM imposed oxidative stress on the ASK cell line and longer exposure time involved transcriptional responses of immune-related genes. This may indicate the possible role of BPA-associated oxidative stress in induction of inflammatory response in this macrophage-like cell type.",0
"Pure spray dried DHA rich microalgae biomass (Schizochytrium sp.) was used to replace fish oil as a source of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA) in medium (150 g kg-1; MF) and low fish (100 g kg-1; LF) meal diets for Atlantic salmon post smolt supplemented with either inorganic or organic minerals (OM: Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe and Se). The diets were balanced for total saturated fatty acids (SFA), sum DHA + EPA and n-3/n-6 ratio and had similar protein and energy digestibility and high pellet technical quality. Lipid digestibility was above 90% in all diets, nevertheless 2.3% lower in the diet containing 50 g kg-1 microalgae, compared to the control, mainly due to the lower digestibility of SFA in the microalgae rich diets. The experimental fish grew from 0.4 kg to 1.1 kg with no significant differences in growth rate (TGC 3.7-3.8) or feed conversion ratio (FCR 0.7) among the dietary treatments. The retention efficiency of EPA + DHA in salmon body was significantly improved in the fish fed diets containing increasing levels of microalgae, and thus lower EPA/DHA ratios. Moreover, liver lipid levels were decreased and dress-out percentage increased by increasing microalgae dietary supplementation level. The fillet levels of SFA and DHA + EPA were similar for all treatments. Improved fillet quality in terms of lower gaping scores was observed with increasing dietary inclusion level of Schizochytrium sp. and even more pronounced for salmon fed organic minerals. No significant effects on fish blood plasma chemistry and whole body mineral content were observed. Statement of relevance. Aquaculture is in urgent need of adequate volumes of new LCn-3PUFA sources, alternative to fish oil. The current work documents the feasibility of using practically relevant levels of heterotrophic microalgae as LCn-3PUFA source in the diet of Atlantic salmon in terms of extruded feed production feasibility, general fish performance, fish fillet product quality (nutritional and technical), nutrient retention efficiency and blood chemistry.

"Environmental conditions are known to affect phenotypic development in many organisms, making the characteristics of an animal reared under one set of conditions not always representative of animals reared under a different set of conditions. Previous results show that such plasticity can also affect the phenotypes and ecological interactions of different genotypes, including animals anthropogenically generated by genetic modification. To understand how plastic development can affect behavior in animals of different genotypes, we examined the feeding and risk-taking behavior in growth-enhanced transgenic coho salmon (with two- to threefold enhanced daily growth rates compared to wild type) under a range of conditions. When compared to wild-type siblings, we found clear effects of the rearing environment on feeding and risk-taking in transgenic animals and noted that in some cases, this environmental effect was stronger than the effects of the genetic modification. Generally, transgenic fish, regardless of rearing conditions, behaved similar to wild-type fish reared under natural-like conditions. Instead, the more unusual phenotype was associated with wild-type fish reared under hatchery conditions, which possessed an extreme risk averse phenotype compared to the same strain reared in naturalized conditions. Thus, the relative performance of genotypes from one environment (e.g., laboratory) may not always accurately reflect ecological interactions as would occur in a different environment (e.g., nature). Further, when assessing risks of genetically modified organisms, it is important to understand how the environment affects phenotypic development, which in turn may variably influence consequences to ecosystem components across different conditions found in the complexity of nature.",1
"The efficacy of a microbial feed additive (Bactocell((R))) in countering intestinal inflammation in Atlantic salmon was examined in this study. Fish were fed either the additive-coated feed (probiotic) or feed without it (control). After an initial 3-week feeding, an inflammatory condition was induced by anally intubating all the fish with oxazolone. The fish were offered the feeds for 3 more weeks. Distal intestine from the groups was obtained at 4 h, 24 h, and 3 weeks, after oxazolone treatment. Inflammatory responses were prominent in both groups at 24 h, documented by changes in intestinal micromorphology, expression of inflammation-related genes, and intestinal proteome. The control group was characterized by edema, widening of intestinal villi and lamina propria, infiltration of granulocytes and lymphocytes, and higher expression of genes related to inflammatory responses, mul1b, il1b, tnfa, ifng, compared to the probiotic group or other time points of the control group. Further, the protein expression in the probiotic group at 24 h after inducing inflammation revealed five differentially regulated proteins - Calr, Psma5, Trp1, Ctsb, and Naga. At 3 weeks after intubation, the inflammatory responses subsided in the probiotic group. The findings provide evidence that the microbial additive contributes to intestinal homeostasis in Atlantic salmon.",0
Salmon nasal cartilage was micronized in ethanol using a rotor-stator homogenizer for the high yield of proteoglycan extraction. This procedure also brought about depressing the degradation of proteoglycan and the contamination of collagens. Proteoglycan was extracted by 4 M magnesium chloride and isolated by anion-exchange chromatography. The gel filtration HPLC and the antibody reactivity showed that the core protein was intact.,0
"Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is an important, systemic viral disease of farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. Endothelial cells are the main target cells for highly virulent HPR-deleted ISA virus (ISAV) types. Here we examine the pathogenesis of non-virulent ISAV HPR0 infections, presenting evidence of an epithelial tropism for this virus type, including actual infection and replication in the epithelial cells. Whereas all HPR0 RT-qPCR positive gills prepared for cryosection tested positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescent labelling, only 21% of HPR0 RT-qPCR positive formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gills were IHC positive, suggesting different methodological sensitivities. Only specific epithelial cell staining was observed and no staining was observed in endothelial cells of positive gills. Furthermore, using an ISAV segment 7 RT-PCR assay, we demonstrated splicing of HPR0, suggesting initial activation of the replication machinery in the epithelial gill cells. Immunological responses were investigated by the expression of interferon-related genes (e.g. Mx and gammaIP) and by ELISA for presence of anti-ISAV antibodies on samples taken sequentially over several months during an episode of transient HPR0 infection. All fish revealed a variable, but increased expression of the immunological markers in comparison to normal healthy fish. Taken together, we conclude that HPR0 causes a localized epithelial infection of Atlantic salmon.",0
"Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to describe a national foodborne emergency functional exercise conducted in 2013 by the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA), and focusses on how elements of the exercise: organization, scenario and evaluation contributed to learning effect to the organization. Design/methodology/approach. In total, 364 NFSA employees representing all offices and organization levels and representatives from cooperating governmental and business organizations participated. Scenario encompassed a salmonellosis outbreak traced to nationally distributed cured salmon seasoned with non-irradiated imported dill contaminated with Salmonella. Crisis communication was included. Exercise evaluation included questionnaires to participants, monitors reports and interviews with NFSA key personnel. Results were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings. Participants and monitors judged the scenario as realistic and relevant and considered the exercise to have provided good learning to the NFSA. Some insufficiencies of log system, certain lacks of compliance with emergency procedures and some inconsistencies in crisis communication were reported. Following a broad evaluation process, the NFSA has carried out comprehensive revisions of contingency plans and procedures, conveyed the exercise learnings into an ongoing planning for reorganization, and has identified goals and methods for contingency training. Practical implications. Scenario, organization, methods for evaluation and assessments of learning effect may be applicable for similar organizations. Originality/value. This was the largest foodborne outbreak exercise ever conducted in Norway and among the few ones ever reported in scientific journals.",0
"The aim of this study was to develop a new selective and differential medium for isolating Shigella sonnei (designated 3SD medium). The new medium was based on three carbohydrates (lactose, sorbitol, and xylose) and a chromogenic substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside, X-Gal). S. sonnei cannot ferment lactose, sorbitol, or xylose, but can ferment X-Gal, which generates turquoise-blue colonies with rough edges. Other bacteria (54 strains of foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria) produced visually distinct colonies on 3SD medium (colorless or pink-violet colonies), or their growth was inhibited on 3SD medium. The optimum concentration of 50 mg/L X-Gal was selected because it yielded the highest level of morphological discrimination between S. sonnei and other bacteria, and this concentration was cost-effective. Bile salt concentration optimization was performed using healthy, heat-injured, and acid-injured S. sonnei. The recovery rate differed significantly depending on the bile salt concentration; media containing >1.0 g/L bile salt showed significantly lower recovery of stress-injured cells than medium containing 0.5 g/L bile salt (P<0.05). Growth of all Gram-positive bacteria was inhibited on medium containing 0.5 g/L bile salt; therefore, this concentration was used as the optimal concentration. Previous media used to isolate Shigella spp. (MacConkey, xylose lysine desoxycholate, and Salmonella-Shigella agar) showed poor performance when used to support the growth of injured S. sonnei cells, whereas 3SD medium supported a high growth rate of injured and healthy cells (equivalent to that obtained with nutrient-rich tryptic soy agar). To validate the performance of 3SD medium with real specimens, S. sonnei and other bacteria were spiked into samples such as untreated water, carrot, salad, and oyster. 3SD medium showed superior specificity (100%) and sensitivity (100%) for S. sonnei, and yielded no false-positive or false-negative results. Thus, the novel 3SD medium described herein is a powerful tool for the rapid and efficient selective isolation of S. sonnei in research and clinical laboratories, and the food industry.",0
"The bioconcentration potential of fluoxetine (FLX) and its biological effects were investigated in juvenile Pacific oyster exposed for 28 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of FLX (1 ng L(-1), 100 ng L(-1) and up to 10 mug L(-1)). FLX bioaccumulated in oyster flesh resulting in 28-day bioconcentration factors greater than 2,000 and 10,000 by referring to wet and dry weights, respectively. Nevertheless, FLX did not induce oyster mortality, delayed gametogenesis, or lead to adverse histopathological alterations. At the two highest concentrations, despite non-optimal trophic conditions, FLX stimulated shell growth but only in a transient manner, suggesting a role of serotonin in the regulation of feeding and metabolism in bivalves. Those high concentrations seemed to drive bell-shaped responses of catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities throughout the exposure period, which may indicate the activation of antioxidant enzyme synthesis and then an enhanced catabolic rate or direct inhibition of those enzymes. However, no clear oxidative stress was detected because no strong differences in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) content (i.e. lipid peroxidation) were observed between oyster groups, suggesting that cellular defence mechanisms were effective. These results demonstrate the importance of considering additional biomarkers of oxidative stress to obtain a comprehensive overview of the FLX-induced changes in marine bivalves exposed under realistic conditions. Considering the battery of biomarkers used, FLX appears to induce little or no effects on oyster physiology even at a concentration of 10 mug L(-1). These results do not confirm the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) values reported by some authors in other mollusc species.",0
This article highlights the updated food safety guidelines proposed by Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada for British Columbia shellfish industry to enhance the management of risks associated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus in oysters intended for raw consumption.,0
"As aquaculture becomes more important for feeding the growing world population, so too do the required natural resources needed to produce aquaculture feed. While there is potential to replace fish meal and fish oil with terrestrial feed ingredients, it is important to understand both the positive and negative implications of such a development. The use of feed with a large proportion of terrestrial feed may reduce the pressure on fisheries to provide feed for fish, but at the same time it may significantly increase the pressure on freshwater resources, due to water consumption and pollution in crop production for aquafeed. Here the green, blue and gray water footprint of cultured fish and crustaceans related to the production of commercial feed for the year 2008 has been determined for the major farmed species, representing 88% of total fed production. The green, blue and gray production-weighted average feed water footprints of fish and crustaceans fed commercial aquafeed are estimated at 1629 m3/t, 179 m3/t and 166 m3/t, respectively. The estimated global total water footprint of commercial aquafeed was 31-35 km3 in 2008. The top five contributors to the total water footprint of commercial feed are Nile tilapia, Grass carp, Whiteleg shrimp, Common carp and Atlantic salmon, which together have a water footprint of 18.2 km3. An analysis of alternative diets revealed that the replacement of fish meal and fish oil with terrestrial feed ingredients may further increase pressure on freshwater resources. At the same time economic consumptive water productivity may be reduced, especially for carnivorous species. The results of the present study show that, for the aquaculture sector to grow sustainably, freshwater consumption and pollution due to aquafeed need to be taken into account.",1
"Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of epidemic and sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Oysters are well recognized as the main vectors of environmentally transmitted NoVs, and disease outbreaks linked to oyster consumption have been commonly observed. Here, to quantify the genetic diversity, temporal distribution, and circulation of oyster-related NoVs on a global scale, 1,077 oyster-related NoV sequences deposited from 1983 to 2014 were downloaded from both NCBI GenBank and the NoroNet outbreak database and were then screened for quality control. A total of 665 sequences with reliable information were obtained and were subsequently subjected to genotyping and phylogenetic analyses. The results indicated that the majority of oyster-related NoV sequences were obtained from coastal countries and regions and that the numbers of sequences in these regions were unevenly distributed. Moreover, >80% of human NoV genotypes were detected in oyster samples or oyster-related outbreaks. A higher proportion of genogroup I (GI) (34%) was observed for oyster-related sequences than for non-oyster-related outbreaks, where GII strains dominated with an overwhelming majority of >90%, indicating that the prevalences of GI and GII are different in humans and oysters. In addition, a related convergence of the circulation trend was found between oyster-related NoV sequences and human pandemic outbreaks. This suggests that oysters not only act as a vector of NoV through environmental transmission but also serve as an important reservoir of human NoVs. These results highlight the importance of oysters in the persistence and transmission of human NoVs in the environment and have important implications for the surveillance of human NoVs in oyster samples.",0
"Over the last decade the health and environmental research communities have made significant progress in collecting and improving access to genomic, toxicology, exposure, health, and disease data useful to health risk assessment. One of the barriers to applying these growing volumes of information in fields such as risk assessment is the lack of informatics tools to organize, curate, and evaluate thousands of journal publications and hundreds of databases to provide new insights on relationships among exposure, hazard, and disease burden. Many fields are developing ontologies as a way of organizing and analyzing large amounts of complex information from multiple scientific disciplines. Ontologies include a vocabulary of terms and concepts with defined logical relationships to each other. Building from the recently published exposure ontology and other relevant health and environmental ontologies, this article proposes an ontology for health risk assessment (RsO) that provides a structural framework for organizing risk assessment information and methods. The RsO is anchored by eight major concepts that were either identified by exploratory curations of the risk literature or the exposure-ontology working group as key for describing the risk assessment domain. These concepts are: (1) stressor, (2) receptor, (3) outcome, (4) exposure event, (5) dose-response approach, (6) dose-response metric, (7) uncertainty, and (8) measure of risk. We illustrate the utility of these concepts for the RsO with example curations of published risk assessments for ionizing radiation, arsenic in drinking water, and persistent pollutants in salmon.",0
"In this study, we investigated the use of branchial carbonic anhydrase activity in a sessile filter feeding species, the oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae, as a biomarker. The oysters were collected in three human impacted Brazilian estuaries, following a crescent latitudinal gradient: in Pernambuco state (Itamaraca), in Espirito Santo state (Piraque), and in Parana state (Paranagua), in August/2003 (Winter in the southern hemisphere) and February/2004 (Summer). Three sites were chosen in each estuary for oyster sampling: Reference (R), Contaminated 1 (C1, close to industrial/harbor contamination), and Contaminated 2 (C2, near to sewage discharges). Comparing to values in oysters sampled in reference sites, there was apparent inhibition in carbonic anhydrase activity (CAA) in gills of oysters from C1 of Itamaraca and from C2 of Piraque, both cases in Summer. On the other hand, increased CAA was noted in C2 oysters of Itamaraca in winter, and of Paranagua, in both seasons. Branchial CAA in C. rhizophorae was thus very responsive to coastal contamination. Data are consistent with its usefulness as a supporting biomarker for inexpensive and rapid analysis in the assessment of estuaries using a sessile osmoconformer species, but preferably allied to other biomarkers and with knowledge on the suite of contaminants present.",0
"The aim of this study was to detect evidence of Toxoplasma gondii using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques in oysters (Crassostrea rhizophorae) obtained from the southern coastal region of Bahia, Brazil. A total of 624 oysters were collected, and the gills and digestive glands were dissected. Each tissue sample was separated into pools containing tissues (of the same type) from three animals, leading to a total of 416 experimental samples for analysis (208 samples each from the gills and digestive glands). Molecular analysis using PCR-based detection of the T. gondii AF 146527 repetitive fragment yielded negative results for all samples. However, when nested-PCR was used for detection of the T. gondii SAG-1 gene, 17 samples were positive, with the gills being the tissue with maximal detection of the parasite. These positive results were confirmed by sample sequencing. It is therefore suggested that C. rhizophorae oysters are capable of filtering and retaining T. gondii oocysts in their tissue. This represents a risk to public health because they are traditionally ingested in natura.",1
"Safe utilization of fish by-products is an important task due to increasing fish consumption. It can provide new valuable food/feed and will increase the economical profit and sustainability of the fishery industry. NMR spectroscopy is a reliable tool able to monitor qualitative and quantitative changes in by-products. In this work the trichloroacetic acid extracts of salmon backbones, heads and viscera stored at industrially relevant temperatures (4 and 10 degrees C) were studied using NMR. Twenty-five metabolites were detected and the possibility of salmon by-products utilization as a source of anserine, phosphocreatine and taurine was discussed. Statistical data elaboration allowed determining the main processes occurring during by-products storage: formation of trimethylamine and biogenic amines, proteolysis and different types of fermentations. By-products freshness was evaluated using a multi-parameter approach: the trimethylamine and biogenic amines concentration changes were compared with Ki and H-values and safe temperatures and times for storage of salmon by-products were proposed.",0
"Introduction. Spoilage is a process, in which food deteriorates to the point, when the quality of the product is unacceptable for consumers due to the microbiological, chemical or physical changes. The activity of microorganisms leads to the synthesis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be considered as the indicators of spoilage and causing off-odors in highly perishable foods, like raw fish. Purpose. The objectives of this study were to select specific spoilage organism (SSO) and to identify VOCs as possible indicators of freshness of raw salmon fillets stored aerobically at different temperatures. Methods. The growth of total viable count (TVC), psychrotrophs, Pseudomonas spp., coliforms, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Brochothrix thermosphacta, H2S producing bacteria, yeasts and molds were investigated. The VOCs profiles were determined using HS-SPME-GC-MS. Weighted samples of salmon fillets were stored at 4 and 10√ÅC for 14 days and 21√ÅC for 3 days, respectively. SSO and volatile indicators were identified with use of modeling, statistical and multivariate analysis. Results. Shewanella putrefaciens-like bacteria (H2S producing bacteria) can be considered as SSO for aerobically stored salmon fillets, as it was characterized by the highest maximum growth rate at 4√ÅC. However, spoiled salmon samples were dominated by: psychrotrophs, probably with Pseudomonas spp., as major representative, followed by B. thermospacta and H2S producing bacteria. The predicted shelf lives of salmon fillets, at TVC = 7.0 CFU/g, were 3.02, 1.82 and 0.60 days for storage at 4, 10 and 21√ÅC, respectively. While, the sensory rejection point was observed at TVC = 7.5 CFU/g (on 4th day at 4√ÅC). Regardless of storage temperature, significant (P< 0.05) and high correlations between microbial counts and selected VOCs were observed for trimethylamine, ethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, acetoin, acetic acid and 2,3-butanediol. Significance. This study showed that the identified VOCs might be suitable as indicators of rapid spoilage detection for aerobically stored fresh salmon.",0
"The purpose of this study was to compare the accumulation of metallic and organic pollutants in marine sponges with the oyster Crassostrea gigas used as sentinel species. The concentrations of 12 Metallic Trace Elements (MTEs), 16 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), 7 PolyChlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), and 3 organotin derivatives were measured in 7 marine sponges collected in the Etel River (South Brittany, France). Results indicated Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Pb, and Ti particularly accumulated in marine sponges such as Hymeniacidon perlevis and Raspailia ramosa at higher levels compared to oysters. At the opposite, Cu and Zn accumulated significantly at higher concentrations in oysters. Among PAHs analyzed, benzo(a)pyrene bioaccumulated in H. perlevis at levels up to 17-fold higher than in oysters. In contrast, PCBs bioaccumulated preferentially in oysters. Significant differences exist in the abilities of marine phyla and sponge species to accumulate organic and metallic pollutants however, among the few sponge species studied, H. perlevis showed impressive bioaccumulation properties. The use of this species as bioindicator and/or bioremediator near shellfish farming areas is also discussed.",0
"Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a reovirus that has predominantly been detected in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). PRV is associated with heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon, and recently erythrocytes were identified as major target cells. The study of PRV replication and pathogenesis of the infection has been impeded by the inability to propagate PRV in vitro. In this study we developed an ex vivo cultivation system for PRV in Atlantic salmon erythrocytes. PRV was successfully passaged to naive erythrocytes using lysates of blood cells from infected salmon. During cultivation a significant increase in viral load was observed by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, which coincided with the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions resembled viral factories and contained both PRV protein and dsRNA. In addition, the erythrocytes generated an antiviral immune gene activation after PRV infection, with significant up-regulation of IFN-alpha, RIG-I, Mx and PKR transcripts. Supernatants from the first passage successfully transmitted virus to naive erythrocytes. This study demonstrates that PRV replicates in Atlantic salmon erythrocytes ex vivo. The ex vivo infection model closely reflects the situation in vivo and can be used to study the infection and replication mechanisms of PRV, as well as the antiviral immune responses of salmonid erythrocytes.",0
"Segment 5, ORF 1 of the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) genome, encodes for the ISAV F protein, which is responsible for viral-host endosomal membrane fusion during a productive ISAV infection. The entry machinery of ISAV is composed of a complex of the ISAV F and ISAV hemagglutinin esterase (HE) proteins in an unknown stoichiometry prior to receptor engagement by ISAV HE. Following binding of the receptor to ISAV HE, dissociation of the ISAV F protein from HE, and subsequent endocytosis, the ISAV F protein resolves into a fusion-competent oligomeric state. Here, we present a 2.1 A crystal structure of the fusion core of the ISAV F protein determined at low pH. This structure has allowed us to unambiguously demonstrate that the ISAV entry machinery exhibits typical class I viral fusion protein architecture. Furthermore, we have determined stabilizing factors that accommodate the pH-dependent mode of ISAV transmission, and our structure has allowed the identification of a central coil that is conserved across numerous and varied post-fusion viral glycoprotein structures. We then discuss a mechanistic model of ISAV fusion that parallels the paramyxoviral class I fusion strategy wherein attachment and fusion are relegated to separate proteins in a similar fashion to ISAV fusion.",0
"The effect of culinary treatments on the fatty acid profile, mercury (Hg), and methylmercury (MeHg) levels of salmon was studied. The bioaccessibility of fatty acids, Hg, and MeHg in raw and grilled salmon was determined. The most intense thermal treatment (grilling) did not alter the relative fatty acid (FA) profile. There were bioaccessibility differences between FAs. To the authors' knowledge, for the first time, higher bioaccessibility of the long-chain FAs than the short- and medium-chain FAs was measured. Chemical interaction phenomena seemed to play a role. On the other hand, higher levels of unsaturation decreased bioaccessibility. Two main alternative hypotheses were put forward, either lower polarity led to higher incorporation of FAs with longer hydrophobic aliphatic chain and lower number of double bonds in the emulsion present in the bioaccessible fraction or enzymatic selectivity preferentially hydrolyzed some FAs on the basis of their structure or position in the triacylglycerol molecule.",0
"Modified peptide was prepared from oysters by zinc binding and plastein reaction. The effects of pH, digestive enzymes, heat treatment, storage time, and other factors on the stability of the modified peptide were studied. Additionally, the stability of the new modified peptide was compared with that of zinc-binding polypeptide and zinc-binding glutamic acid. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated that new substances were generated after plastein reactions; zinc-binding complexes were easily degraded at pH = 2.0, while they were relatively stable at pH = 9.0; and the stability of zinc-binding glutamic acid was significantly lower than that of zinc-binding peptides (p < 0.05). All zinc-binding complexes exhibited resistance to digestive enzymes and the stability of zinc-binding glutamic acid was significantly lower than that of other zinc-binding peptides (P < 0.05). The modified peptide and zinc-binding polypeptides were sensitive to heat treatment and their stability was significantly lower than that of zinc-binding glutamic acid (p < 0.05). Zinc-binding complexes exhibited good stability and zinc retention rate reached up to 95.50% as storage time increased.",0
"Bivalve culture is of considerable economic and social interest in northeastern (NE) Brazil. The polyculture is an alternative approach to traditional monoculture for reducing the environmental impact of shrimp farming and improving oyster culture. Perkinsus marinus and Perkinsus olseni were found infecting oysters in NE Brazil and can threaten oyster production. This study evaluated Perkinsus spp. occurrence in Crassostrea gasar during all production stages. Oyster spats were produced in a hatchery and grown in shrimp ponds in Rio Grande do Norte state. Perkinsus spp. were surveyed by Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Prevalence and intensity of infection were determined in oysters until they reached 7 cm. Results showed that the broodstock was already infected by Perkinsus (60%), but the derived spats were Perkinsus-free. Oyster spats acquired Perkinsus infection when transferred to ponds. The prevalence gradually increased in the seven months following placement in ponds (73%), and then decreased to 17% by the tenth month. The infections were initially mild, but intensity increased at the final growth stage. In conclusion, it is possible to produce Perkinsus-free C. gasar oyster spats from infected broodstock, and their culture in shrimp ponds is feasible.",1
"Understanding the impacts of metal stress on the reproduction of dominant species, such as oysters, in seriously contaminated estuarine environments has great ecological implications. In the present study, the reproductive conditions were examined monthly for 1 year in oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis from a heavily metal-contaminated site (Baijiao, mainly by Cu and Zn) in the Jiulong River estuary and a relatively clean nearby estuary (Jiuzhen). Oysters sampled in the contaminated site showed a delayed gametogenesis, a relatively shorter spawning period, and a lower gonad condition index in comparison to the oysters sampled in the reference site. In particular, we found that the proportion of females increased significantly in the contaminated oysters, which provided the first evidence that the feminization in wild oyster populations could be related to trace metal pollution. Additionally, the potential detoxification mechanism of trace metals in oysters was also investigated. Compartmentalization of trace metals in membrane-limited vesicles in hemocytes could be an important detoxification mechanism for the contaminated oysters. Our findings indicated that the long-term metal exposure may greatly influence the reproduction of the oysters and finally affect the recruitment and population of this species.",1
"Sea lice infestation levels on wild chum and pink salmon in the Broughton Archipelago region are known to vary spatially and temporally; however, the locations of areas associated with a high infestation level had not been investigated yet. In the present study, the multivariate spatial scan statistic based on a Poisson model was used to assess spatial clustering of elevated sea lice (Caligus clemensi and Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestation levels on wild chum and pink salmon sampled between March and July of 2004 to 2012 in the Broughton Archipelago and Knight Inlet regions of British Columbia, Canada. Three covariates, seine type (beach and purse seining), fish size, and year effect, were used to provide adjustment within the analyses. The analyses were carried out across the five months/datasets and between two fish species to assess the consistency of the identified clusters. Sea lice stages were explored separately for the early life stages (non-motile) and the late life stages of sea lice (motile). Spatial patterns in fish migration were also explored using monthly plots showing the average number of each fish species captured per sampling site. The results revealed three clusters for non-motile C. clemensi, two clusters for non-motile L. salmonis, and one cluster for the motile stage in each of the sea lice species. In general, the location and timing of clusters detected for both fish species were similar. Early in the season, the clusters of elevated sea lice infestation levels on wild fish are detected in areas closer to the rivers, with decreasing relative risks as the season progresses. Clusters were detected further from the estuaries later in the season, accompanied by increasing relative risks. In addition, the plots for fish migration exhibit similar patterns for both fish species in that, as expected, the juveniles move from the rivers toward the open ocean as the season progresses The identification of space-time clustering of infestation on wild fish from this study can help in targeting investigations of factors associated with these infestations and thereby support the development of more effective sea lice control measures.",0
"The current study is aimed to study cytotoxicity and oxidative stress mediated changes induced by copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) in Chinook salmon cells (CHSE-214). To this end, a number of biochemical responses are evaluated in CHSE-214 cells which are as follows [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide] MTT, neutral red uptake (NRU), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), protein carbonyl (PC), lipid peroxidation (LPO), oxidised glutathione (GSSG), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione sulfo-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. The 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of CuO NPs to CHSE-214 cells after 24 h exposure was found to be 19.026 mug ml(-1). Viability of cells was reduced by CuO NPs, and the decrease was dose dependent as revealed by the MTT and NRU assay. CHSE-214 cells exposed to CuO NPs induced morphological changes. Initially, cells started to detach from the surface (12 h), followed by polyhedric, fusiform appearance (19 h) and finally the cells started to shrink. Later, the cells started losing their cellular contents leading to their death only after 24 h. LDH, PC, LPO, GSH, GPx, GST, SOD, CAT, 8-OHdG and ROS responses were seen significantly increased with the increase in the concentration of CuO NPs when compared to their respective controls. However, significant decrease in GSSG was perceptible in CHSE-214 cells exposed to CuO NPs in a dose-dependent manner. Our data demonstrated that CuO NPs induced cytotoxicity in CHSE-214 cells through the mediation of oxidative stress. The current study provides a baseline for the CuO NPs-mediated cytotoxic assessment in CHSE-214 cells for the future studies.",0
"The average sizes of Pacific salmon have declined in some areas in the Northeast Pacific over the past few decades, but the extent and geographic distribution of these declines in Alaska is uncertain. Here, we used regression analyses to quantify decadal trends in length and age at maturity in ten datasets from commercial harvests, weirs, and spawner abundance surveys of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha throughout Alaska. We found that on average these fish have become smaller over the past 30 years (~6 generations), because of a decline in the predominant age at maturity and because of a decrease in age-specific length. The proportion of older and larger 4-ocean age fish in the population declined significantly (P < 0.05) in all stocks examined by return year or brood year. Our analyses also indicated that the age-specific lengths of 4-ocean fish (9 of 10 stocks) and of 3-ocean fish (5 of 10 stocks) have declined significantly (P < 0.05). Size-selective harvest may be driving earlier maturation and declines in size, but the evidence is not conclusive, and additional factors, such as ocean conditions or competitive interactions with other species of salmon, may also be responsible. Regardless of the cause, these wide-spread phenotypic shifts influence fecundity and population abundance, and ultimately may put populations and associated fisheries at risk of decline.",0
"Piscirickettsia salmonis is the etiological agent of piscirickettsiosis, a severe disease causing high mortalities in salmonids. This bacterium has been previously identified and isolated in all cultivated salmonids in Chile and worldwide, including Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and O. mykiss, in addition to being found in non-salmonid species such as Dicentrarchus labrax and Atractoscion nobilis. In this study, the 16S rRNA gene and intergenic spacer ITS-1 of P. salmonis were amplified by PCR from DNA samples extracted from the native Chilean fish species Eleginops maclovinus, Odontesthes regia, Sebastes capensis, and Salilota australis. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences from O. regia demonstrated a close phylogenetic relationship with the 16S rRNA gene in the Chilean EM-90 strain. The 16S rRNA sequences from E. maclovinus, S. capensis, and S. australis were related to the Chilean LF-89 sequence and Scottish strains. To confirm these findings, analysis of P. salmonis ITS-1 sequences obtained from the 4 sampled native species demonstrated a high degree of identity and a close phylogenetic relationship with Chilean P. salmonis sequences, including LF-89 and EM-90. These results suggest a strong relationship between the nucleotide sequences from the 16S rRNA and ITS-1 genes amplified from native fish with those sequences described in the first P. salmonis strains to be identified and isolated in Chile.",0
"UNLABELLED: Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is the etiological agent of the disease by the same name and causes major losses in the salmon industry worldwide. Epizootic ISAV outbreaks have occurred in Norway and, to a lesser degree, in Canada. In 2007, an ISAV outbreak in Chile destroyed most of the seasonal production and endangered the entire Chilean salmon industry. None of the existing prophylactic approaches have demonstrated efficacy in providing absolute protection from or even a palliative effect on ISAV proliferation. Sanitary control measures for ISAV, based on molecular epidemiology data, have proven insufficient, mainly due to high salmon culture densities and a constant presence of a nonpathogenic strain of the virus. This report describes an alternative treatment approach based on interfering peptides selected from a phage display library. The screening of a phage display heptapeptide library resulted in the selection of a novel peptide with significant in vitro antiviral activity against ISAV. This peptide specifically interacted with the viral hemagglutinin-esterase protein, thereby impairing virus binding, with plaque reduction assays showing a significant reduction in viral yields. The identified peptide acts at micromolar concentrations against at least two different pathogenic strains of the virus, without detectable cytotoxic effects on the tested fish cells. Therefore, antiviral peptides represent a novel alternative for controlling ISAV and, potentially, other fish pathogens. IMPORTANCE: Identifying novel methods for the efficient control of infectious diseases is imperative for the future of global aquaculture. The present study used a phage display heptapeptide library to identify a peptide with interfering activity against a key protein of the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). A piscine orthomyxovirus, ISAV is a continuous threat to the commercial sustainability of cultured salmon production worldwide. The complex epidemiological strategy of this pathogen has made prophylactic control extremely difficult. The identified antiviral peptide efficiently impairs ISAV infection in vitro by specifically blocking hemagglutinin-esterase, a pivotal surface protein of this virus. Peptide synthesis could further modify the primary structure of the identified peptide to improve specific activity and stability. The present results form the foundation for developing a new pharmacological treatment against ISAV.",0
"This study focuses on the discussion of different lines of evidence (LoEs) applied to a sediment-quality assessment that considered the following: chemical concentrations of metals; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in estuarine waters, sediments, and oysters (native and caged Crassostrea brasiliana); PAHs in semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs); simultaneously extracted metals-acid volatile sulfides (SEM-AVS); benthic community assessment (the exploratory benthic index and the relative benthic index); chronic toxicity tests with the sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus; and bioaccumulation models. Significantly contaminated sediments from the Santos Estuarine System and the consequent toxicity of tested organisms were measured. Caged oysters presented bioaccumulation rates </=2,500% of total PAH content and 200% of metal content when compared with control organisms from an uncontaminated area. SPMD results presented the same bioaccumulation pattern as caged oysters but at lower concentrations. Benthic communities presented some alterations, and there was a predominance of tolerant species in the inner part of the estuary. According to the SEM-AVS approach, metals should be assumed to be nonbioavailable, but experiments with transplanted C. brasiliana showed metal bioaccumulation, particularly in the cases of chromium, copper, mercury, and zinc. The weight-of-evidence approach was applied to compare and harmonize LoEs commonly used in sediment-quality assessments and to then classify estuary environments according to both their potential for having adverse effects on the biota and their possible ecological risks. All of the results of these approaches (except for SEM-AVS) were found to complement each other.",0
"A new group of arsenolipids based on cell-membrane phosphatidylcholines has been discovered in herring caviar (fish roe). A combination of HPLC with elemental and molecular mass spectrometry was used to identify five arsenic-containing phosphatidylcholines; the same technique applied to salmon caviar identified an arsenic-containing phosphatidylethanolamine. The arsenic group in these membrane lipids might impart particular properties to the molecules not displayed by their non-arsenic analogues. Additionally, the new compounds have human health implications according to recent results showing high cytotoxicity for some arsenolipids.",1
"A challenge model for pancreas disease in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. fry, was developed comparing two salmonid alphavirus (SAV) subtypes: SAV1 and SAV5. Viral doses of 3 x 10(5) TCID50 mL(-1) for SAV1 and 3 x 10(4) for SAV5 were tested in triplicate tanks, each containing 450 salmon fry. Cumulative mortalities of 1.2% were recorded. Titres of virus recovered from the mortalities ranged from 10(2) to 10(7) TCID50 mL(-1) . Fry were sampled at 3, 5 and 7.5 weeks post-challenge. Sampling after 3 weeks revealed a high prevalence of infection in the absence of clinical signs, and infectious virus was recovered from 80% and 43% of sampled fry infected with SAV1 and SAV5, respectively. After 5 weeks pancreas, heart and red skeletal muscle lesions were generally observed, whilst degeneration in white skeletal muscle was observed only in fish infected with SAV1. In situ hybridisation confirmed the presence of viral genome in infected pancreas, heart and muscle. After 7.5 weeks, infectious virus (both isolates) was recovered from 13.3% of the fish sampled, with a viral titre of 10(2) TCID50 mL(-1) . Clearly, salmon fry are susceptible to SAV infection and pancreas disease.",0
"BACKGROUND: Piscirickettsiosis or Salmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS) is a bacterial disease that has a major economic impact on the Chilean salmon farming industry. Despite the fact that Piscirickettsia salmonis has been recognized as a major fish pathogen for over 20 years, the molecular strategies underlying the fish response to infection and the bacterial mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. We analysed and compared the head kidney transcriptional response of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) families with different levels of susceptibility to P. salmonis infection in order to reveal mechanisms that might confer infection resistance. RESULTS: We ranked forty full-sibling Atlantic salmon families according to accumulated mortality after a challenge with P. salmonis and selected the families with the lowest and highest cumulative mortalities for microarray gene expression analysis. A comparison of the response to P. salmonis infection between low and high susceptibility groups identified biological processes presumably involved in natural resistance to the pathogen. In particular, expression changes of genes linked to cellular iron depletion, as well as low iron content and bacterial load in the head kidney of fish from low susceptibility families, suggest that iron-deprivation is an innate immunity defence mechanism against P. salmonis. To complement these results, we predicted a set of iron acquisition genes from the P. salmonis genome. Identification of putative Fur boxes and expression of the genes under iron-depleted conditions revealed that most of these genes form part of the Fur regulon of P. salmonis. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed, for the first time, differences in the transcriptional response to P. salmonis infection among Atlantic salmon families with varied levels of susceptibility to the infection. These differences correlated with changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins directly and indirectly involved in the immune response; changes that highlighted the role of nutritional immunity through iron deprivation in host defence mechanisms against P. salmonis. Additionally, we found that P. salmonis has several mechanisms for iron acquisition, suggesting that this bacterium can obtain iron from different sources, including ferric iron through capturing endogenous and exogenous siderophores and ferrous iron. Our results contribute to determining the underlying resistance mechanisms of Atlantic salmon to P. salmonis infection and to identifying future treatment strategies.",0
"The United States has federal regulations in place to reduce the risk of seafood-related infection caused by the estuarine bacteria Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. However, data to support the development of regulations have been generated in a very few specific regions of the nation. More regionally specific data are needed to further understand the dynamics of human infection relating to shellfish-harvesting conditions in other areas. In this study, oysters and water were collected from four oyster harvest sites in North Carolina over an 11-month period. Samples were analyzed for the abundances of total Vibrio spp., V. vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus; environmental parameters, including salinity, water temperature, wind velocity, and precipitation, were also measured simultaneously. By utilizing these data, preliminary predictive management tools for estimating the abundance of V. vulnificus bacteria in shellfish were developed. This work highlights the need for further research to elucidate the full suite of factors that drive V. parahaemolyticus abundance.",0
"Field studies were conducted to determine levels of gill aluminium as an index of acidification effects on migrating Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts in the north-eastern U.S.A. along mainstem river migration corridors in several major river basins. Smolts emigrating from the Connecticut River, where most (but not all) tributaries were well buffered, had low or undetectable levels of gill aluminium and high gill Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase (NKA) activity. In contrast, smolts emigrating from the upper Merrimack River basin where most tributaries are characterized by low pH and high inorganic aluminium had consistently elevated gill aluminium and lower gill NKA activity, which may explain the low adult return rates of S. salar stocked into the upper Merrimack catchment. In the Sheepscot, Narraguagus and Penobscot Rivers in Maine, river and year-specific effects on gill aluminium were detected that appeared to be driven by underlying geology and high spring discharge. The results indicate that episodic acidification is affecting S. salar smolts in poorly buffered streams in New England and may help explain variation in S. salar survival and abundance among rivers and among years, with implications for the conservation and recovery of S. salar in the north-eastern U.S.A. These results suggest that the physiological condition of outmigrating smolts may serve as a large-scale sentinel of landscape-level recovery of atmospheric pollution in this and other parts of the North Atlantic region.",0
"The presence of organic mercury (methylmercury) in tuna, salmon and kani sushis marketed in restaurants specialising in Japanese foods (Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil), was investigated by atomic absorption spectrometer with thermal decomposition and amalgamation. Total mercury was analyzed directly, whilst organic mercury was quantified after a previous extraction with toluene in an acid solution, assisted by microwaves. Under these analytical conditions there was no interconversion between the inorganic and organic mercury. High sensitivity was observed for organic mercury, with limits of detection and quantification of 2.0 and 6.6 mug kg-1. The organic mercury contents ranged from 12 to 583 mug kg-1, 6.6 to 8.2 mug kg-1 and no detected values, for the tuna, kani and salmon sushi, respectively. The mean proportion of organic Hg/total Hg for tuna sushi was 88%, indicating that the most toxic form of mercury, organic Hg, predominate in this food. The estimated exposure to methylmercury was made by taking into account the Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI 1.6 mug/kg) considering the daily consumption of 150 g and 20 g per adults (60 kg) and children (15 kg), respectively. Our results demonstrated that the consumption of tuna sushi may exceed 100% of PTWI. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"One of the most significant threats to the Chilean salmon aquaculture industry is the ectoparasitic sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi. To cope with sea lice infestations, functional diets have become an important component in strengthening the host immune response. The aim of this study was to evaluate molecular mechanisms activated through immunostimulation by in-feed plant-derived additives in Atlantic salmon infected with sea lice. Herein, a transcriptome-wide sequencing analysis was performed from skin and head kidney tissues, evidencing that the immune response genes were the most variable after the challenge, especially in the head kidney, while other genes involved in metabolism were highly expressed individuals fed with the immunostimulants. Interestingly, defensive enzymes such as Cytochrome p450 and serpins were down-regulated in infested individuals, especially in skin tissue. Additionally, MHC-I and MHC-II genes were differentially expressed after the incorporation of the in-feed additives, giving some cues about the protection mechanisms of plant-derived compound as immunostimulants for infested salmons. This is the first published study that evaluates the transcriptomic response of sea lice-infested Atlantic salmon fed with in-feed additives.",0
"The objective of this study was to quantify a number of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus. Ostreatus, and characterize the effects of processing, such as blanching, on these outcomes. Dry matter content was 8%. Lovastatin was not detected in this study. beta-glucan content of 23.9% and total polyphenol content of 487.12 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g of dry matter were obtained in raw P. ostreatus. Antioxidant activities as evaluated by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays in raw P. ostreatus were 14.46, 16.51, and 11.21 micromol/g, respectively. Blanching did not significantly affect beta-glucan content but caused significant decrease in dry matter content, polyphenol content, and antioxidant activities. Mushroom rolls produced from blanched mushrooms and blanching water contained significantly higher amounts of beta-glucan, total polyphenol content, and FRAP antioxidant activity compared to blanched mushrooms. In conclusion, P. ostreatus is a good source for beta-glucan, dietary polyphenols, and antioxidants. Although the blanching process could affect these properties, re-addition of the blanching water during the production process of mushroom rolls could potentially recover these properties and is therefore recommended.",0
"In this study, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SC-CO2) was studied as a method to recover oil from salmon waste. Experiments at pressures of 15, 25, and 35 MPa, temperatures of 313, 333, and 353 K, and CO2 flow rates of 0.18-0.48 kg/h were conducted and the yield compared. The yields at 35 MPa, temperatures of 313, 333, and 353 K, and CO2 flow rates of 0.18 kg/h were approximately 39, 46, and 41 (wt.%). A process model based on intra-particle diffusion (De) and external mass transfer of fish oil (kf) is presented for the supercritical extraction process. The adsorption equilibrium constant (K) is determined by fitting the theoretical extraction curve to the experimental data. The model using the best fit of theoretical extraction curve correlated the experimental data satisfactorily with AAD (%) ranged from 2.4 to 10.6%. All rights reserved, Elsevier.",0
"In fall 2013, anorexia, lethargy and mortalities up to 10-12,000 dead fish per week were observed in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in three fresh water hatcheries (salinity 0-1 per thousand) on the west coast of Norway. The fish (25-100 g) showed signs of circulatory failure with haemorrhages, ascites and anaemia. The histopathological findings comprised inflammation of the heart and red muscle and liver necrosis. The affected fish had a common origin. Disease and mortalities were also observed up to four months after sea water transfer. Microbiological examination did not reveal presence of any known pathogens. Based on histopathological similarities to heart and skeletal inflammation (HSMI) in Atlantic salmon, associated with piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), extended investigations to detect a virus within the family Reoviridae were conducted. By the use of primer sets targeting the PRV genome, a sequence with 85% identity to a part of segment S1 of PRV was obtained. Further analysis showed that the virus sequence could only be aligned with PRV and no other reoviruses both on amino acid and nucleotide level. Two PCR assays were developed for specific detection of the virus. High amounts of the virus were detected in diseased fish at all affected farms and low amounts were detected in low prevalence at the broodfish farms. Further investigations are needed to determine if the virus is associated with the new disease in rainbow trout and to further characterize the virus with respect to classification, relationship with PRV, virulence, pathology and epidemiology.",0
"Sea lice threaten the welfare of farmed Atlantic salmon and the sustainability of fish farming across the world. Chemical treatments are the major method of control but drug resistance means that alternatives are urgently needed. Selective breeding can be a cheap and effective alternative. Here, we combine experimental trials and diagnostics to provide a practical protocol for quantifying resistance to sea lice. We then combined quantitative genetics with epidemiological modelling to make the first prediction of the response to selection, quantified in terms of reduced need for chemical treatments. We infected over 1400 young fish with Lepeophtheirus salmonis, the most important species in the Northern Hemisphere. Mechanisms of resistance were expressed early in infection. Consequently, the number of lice per fish and the ranking of families were very similar at 7 and 17 days post infection, providing a stable window for assessing susceptibility to infection. The heritability of lice numbers within this time window was moderately high at 0.3, confirming that selective breeding is viable. We combined an epidemiological model of sea lice infection and control on a salmon farm with genetic variation in susceptibility among individuals. We simulated 10 generations of selective breeding and examined the frequency of treatments needed to control infection. Our model predicted that substantially fewer chemical treatments are needed to control lice outbreaks in selected populations and chemical treatment could be unnecessary after 10 generations of selection. Selective breeding for sea lice resistance should reduce the impact of sea lice on fish health and thus substantially improve the sustainability of Atlantic salmon production.",0
"Sea lice are the most damaging parasite of marine salmonids, both economically and in terms of potential impacts on wild fish. An increasingly widely applied control is the use of cleaner fish (CF) such as wrasse that eat lice. However, such CF can carry pathogens that may cause disease in salmon, including the potential emergence of new diseases. This is not just a theoretical risk, as demonstrated by a recent outbreak of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia in wrasse held on salmon farms in Shetland. A modelling framework is developed to identify conditions in which emergence might occur, and, from this, means of reducing risk. Diseases that might emerge easily in farmed salmon would be likely to have already done so by other routes of exposure, and if risks are very low, they would need to be greatly enhanced to become significant relative to costs of lice control. CF may most enhance risks from disease with moderate probability of emerging. Risks of emergence can be reduced by replacing wild-caught with hatchery-reared CF, minimizing mixing of CF from different sources, surveillance for clinical disease in the CF and ensuring strategic biosecurity (area management with synchronized fallowing). Reuse of CF for a second salmon production cycle may reduce costs and even probability of infection (especially from wild-caught CF), but should only be considered as part of a rigorous area management programme because the practice presents opportunities for pathogens to adapt to salmon by weakening fallowing.",0
"In this study, light microscope, scanning and transmission electron microscope, hematoxylin-eosin and fluorescent staining, and mass spectrometry methods were employed to observe the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) crystal formation, hemocyte release and transportation, and hemocyte distribution at the shell regeneration area and to analyse the proteome of hemocytes in the pearl oyster, Pinctada fucata. The results indicated that intracellular CaCO3 crystals were observed in circulating hemocytes in P. fucata, implying that there was a suitable microenvironment for crystal formation in the hemocytes. This conclusion was further supported by the proteome analysis, in which various biomineralization-related proteins were detected. The crystal-bearing hemocytes, mainly granulocytes, may be released to extrapallial fluid (EPF) by the secretory cavities distributed on the outer surface of the mantle centre. These granulocytes in the EPF and between the regenerated shells were abundant and free. In the regenerated prismatic layer, the granulocytes were fused into each column and fragmented with the duration of shell maturation, suggesting the direct involvement of hemocytes in shell regeneration. Overall, this study provided evidence that hemocytes participated in CaCO3 crystal formation, transportation and shell regeneration in the pearl oyster. These results are helpful to further understand the exact mechanism of hemocyte-mediated biomineralization in shelled molluscs.",0
"The Wadden Sea is an extensive wetland area, recognized as UNESCO world heritage site of international importance. Since the mid-1990s, the invasive Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) population in the area has grown exponentially, having a distinct impact on the ecosystem. The recent spread of the emerging oyster pathogen Ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 muVar worldwide and specifically in the oyster culture areas in the south of the Netherlands raised the question whether the virus may also be present in the Wadden Sea. In the summer of 2012 juvenile Pacific oysters were collected from five locations in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The virus was shown to be present in three of the five locations by real-time PCR and sequencing. It was concluded that OsHV-1 muVar has settled itself in Pacific oyster reefs in the Wadden Sea. These results and the recent discoveries of OsHV-1 microvariants in Australia and Korea indicate that OsHV-1 muVar and related variants might be more widespread than can be deduced from current literature. In particular in regions with no commercial oyster culture, similar to the Wadden Sea, the virus may go undetected as wild beds with mixed age classes hamper the detection of mortality among juvenile oysters.",1
"Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) embryos were electroporated with sterilization constructs targeting primordial germ cell proteins or with buffer. Some embryos then were treated with repressor compounds, cadmium chloride, copper sulfate, sodium chloride or doxycycline, to prevent expression of the transgene constructs. Promoters included channel catfish nanos and vasa, salmon transferrin (TF), modified yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae copper transport protein (MCTR) and zebrafish racemase (RM). Knock-down systems were the Tet-off (nanos and vasa constructs), MCTR, RM and TF systems. Knock-down genes included shRNAi targeting 5' nanos (N1), 3' nanos (N2) or dead end (DND), or double-stranded nanos RNA (dsRNA) for overexpression of nanos mRNA. These constructs previously were demonstrated to knock down nanos, vasa and dead end, with the repressors having variable success. Exogenous DNA affected percentage hatch (% hatch), as all 14 constructs, except for the TF dsRNA, TF N1 (T), RM DND (C), vasa DND (C), vasa N1 (C) and vasa N2 (C), had lower % hatch than the control electroporated with buffer. The MCTR and RM DND (T) constructs resulted in delayed hatch, and the vasa and nanos constructs had minimal effects on time of hatch (P < 0.05). Cadmium chloride appeared to counteract the slow development caused by the TF constructs in two TF treatments (P < 0.05). The 4 ppt sodium chloride treatment for the RM system decreased % hatch (P < 0.05) and slowed development. In the case of nanos constructs, doxycycline greatly delayed hatch (P < 0.05). Adverse effects of the transgenes and repressors continued for several treatments for the first 6 days after hatch, but only in a few treatments during the next 10 days. Repressors and gene expression impacted the yield of putative transgenic channel catfish fry, and need to be considered and accounted for in the hatchery phase of producing transgenically sterilized catfish fry and their fertile counterparts. This fry output should be considered to ensure that sufficient numbers of transgenic fish are produced for future applications and for defining repressor systems that are the most successful.",0
"In mammals, leptin plays an important role in puberty and reproduction and leptin is regulated by sex steroids. Elevated leptin levels have been associated with sexual maturation in some teleosts such as Atlantic salmon. In the present study, primary cultures of Atlantic salmon hepatocytes were used to investigate the direct effects of different sex steroids on expression of the two salmon leptin-a genes, lepa1 and lepa2. Testosterone (T) stimulated both lepa1 and lepa2 in a dose dependent manner after four days of incubation. The stimulatory effect of T on leptin expression was not prevented by co-incubation with the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole, indicating a direct androgen effect on transcription. The non-aromatizable androgen 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), which is the main androgen in fish, was generally slightly less potent than T in stimulating lepa1 and lepa2. The strongest stimulatory response was seen for 17beta-estradiol (E2). E2 treatment significantly up-regulated lepa1 and lepa2 gene expression at doses of 10nM and 1nM for each gene, respectively. Lepa1, but not lepa2, was stimulated by T and 11-KT in immature male and immature female parr, while E2 stimulated expression of both genes. The sensitivity to sex steroid stimulation differed in maturing males compared to immature. In maturing males, the androgens and E2 stimulated lepa2 but not lepa1, while in immature males, the androgens and E2 stimulated lepa1, but only E2 stimulated lepa2. The differential response of the two leptin paralogues to the sex steroids suggests differences in regulation of the two leptin genes during maturation. Altogether, these results indicate that leptin expression in Atlantic salmon hepatocytes is directly regulated at the transcriptional level by the main teleost androgens and an estrogen, and that the response might depend on the developmental stage of the fish.",0
"Membraneless electrolyzed water (MLEW) is generated by electrolysis of dilute salt water solution without a membrane separating cathodic and anodic water. The stability of MLEW under different storage temperatures and pHs, as well as its lipid oxidizing effects have not been extensively studied. In this study, three storage temperatures and two pH conditions were used to study the stability of the water. MLEW's lipid degradation potential was investigated using two methods by measuring the degree of oxidation of lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids. Lipid oxidation in an emulsion model free of other interferences was conducted with MLEW containing 30, 50 and 100 mg L-1 free chlorine (FC), and lipid oxidation in a salmon fish fillet was conducted by washing the fillet pieces with MLEW containing 100 mg L-1 FC. We found that the MLEW was relatively stable in capped containers under both acidic and neutral pH during the 21-day period. Although there was significant lipid oxidation in the emulsion system, and the extent of oxidation was FC concentration dependent, we did not observe significantly more lipid oxidation in fish treated with MLEW compared to the control (stored under 4 √ÅC for 10 days). Therefore, we conclude that MLEW may be used as a disinfectant in commercial operations without causing significant lipid oxidation and rancidity generation in foods. AOCS 2015.",0
"Salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the aetiological agent of pancreas disease, is recognized as a serious pathogen of farmed Atlantic salmon. This disease results in loss of weight followed by poor growth of surviving fish, as such it is viewed as a wasting disease. SAV and other chronic disease causing viruses affect the heart and skeletal muscle tissues, at present the mechanisms by which pathology occurs is unknown. The relationship between antiviral activity and other physiological parameters especially in skeletal muscle are currently not examined in depth in fish. An experimental SAV (isotype 3) infection was carried out using a cohabitation approach, from which samples were collected at 0, 4, 8 & 12 week post challenge. Maximum viral load in the muscle tissue was 4 weeks post infection which was reduced at 8 weeks and undetectable by 12 weeks. Histopathology score peaked at 4 weeks post infection in pancreas and heart whereas there was maximum damage in skeletal muscle at 8 weeks. The peak expression of antiviral immune genes coincided with the viral load. Several genes involved in protein degradation were increased following infection including atrogin-1 and cathepsin D, at 4 weeks post challenge suggesting reallocation of amino acid reserves. Taken together, these observations increase our understanding of salmon poor growth during viral infection, and will serve as a basis to develop strategies to manage this viral wasting disease.",0
"Highly migratory organisms present major challenges to conservation efforts. This is especially true for exploited anadromous fish species, which exhibit long-range dispersals from natal sites, complex population structures, and extensive mixing of distinct populations during exploitation. By tracing the migratory histories of individual Chinook salmon caught in fisheries using strontium isotopes, we determined the relative production of natal habitats at fine spatial scales and different life histories. Although strontium isotopes have been widely used in provenance research, we present a new robust framework to simultaneously assess natal sources and migrations of individuals within fishery harvests through time. Our results pave the way for investigating how fine-scale habitat production and life histories of salmon respond to perturbations-providing crucial insights for conservation.",0
"The objective of this study was to investigate the growth kinetics of Listeria monocytogenes in unsalted and salted (3%) salmon roe. Growth curves, developed using inoculated samples incubated at constant temperatures between 5 and 30 √ÅC, were analyzed by curve-fitting to the Huang and Baranyi models using the USDA IPMP 2013. The experimental results showed that L. monocytogenes in salted samples exhibited approximately 40% longer lag times than the cells in unsalted samples under the same temperature condition, while the rates of bacterial growth were not affected by the addition of salt. The Ratkowsky square-root (RSR) model, Huang square-root (HSR) model, and an Arrhenius-type model were all shown suitable for evaluating the effect of temperature on specific growth rates. The estimated nominal minimum growth temperature in the RSR model was -0.5 √ÅC, whereas the minimum growth temperature in HSR model was 2.57 √ÅC. The HSR models may be more suitable for describing the temperature effect in salted salmon roe. The lag times of L. monocytogenes were found to change log-linearly with the specific growth rates. The mean h0 in the Baranyi model was 0.742 in unsalted samples and 1.193 in salted samples, and did not appear to change with temperature in a systematic manner. In summary, kinetic models were developed for examining the effect of temperature on growth of L. monocytogenes in unsalted and salted salmon roe samples. The results may be used by the food industry and regulatory agencies to estimate the growth of L. monocytogenes in salmon roe, and to conduct risk assessments of this microorganism.

"The active oyster peptides (AOPs) in enzymatic hydrolyzed oyster protein product have been determinated by gel column chromatogrphy. They were investigated to determine their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Three commercial food-grade proteases were used to hydrolyze the oyster. Among the three hydrolysates, alcalase hydrolysate exerted the highest scavenging activity against a,a-diphenyl-b-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) for use in oyster hydrolysis. The optimum parameters for hydrolysis using alcalase were established by the single-factor and orthogonal tests. Under these conditions, the highest degree of hydrolysis (DH) was 39.89%. Antioxidants of protein hydrolysates at 30.12, 32.69, 38.47 and 39.89% of DH were further investigated by the evaluation of DPPH and hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity. The resulting AOPs' antibacterial activities against some pathogenic microorganisms, including human pathogenic bacteria and marine Vibrio species, were investigated using the agar diffusion method. The results showed interesting antimicrobial potentials against the tested microorganisms, except Vibrio anguillarum. The highest DH of AOPs exhibited a higher antimicrobial potential than lower DH. Practical Applications. Rushan oyster (Crassostrea gigas), with high production in China, is still underutilized despite the fact that it is rich in high quality protein. Oyster protein hydrolysates have been shown to have potential for nutritional or pharmaceutical applications. The aims of this study were to prepare peptides from Rushan oyster by enzymatic hydrolysis and to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity and antioxidant activity of the resulting hydrolysate. The hydrolysis of protein with proteolytic enzymes can provide more marketable and value-added food ingredients or industrial products. 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",0
"In Australia, the spread of the ostreid herpesvirus-1 microvariant (OsHV-1 microVar) threatens the Pacific oyster industry. There is an urgent need to develop an experimental infection model in order to study the pathogenesis of the virus under controlled laboratory conditions. The present study constitutes the first attempt to use archived frozen oysters as a source of inoculum, based on the Australian OsHV-1 microVar strain. Experiments were conducted to test (1) virus infectivity, (2) the dose-response relationship for OsHV-1, and (3) the best conditions in which to store infective viral inoculum. Intramuscular injection of a viral inoculum consistently led to an onset of mortality 48 h post-injection and a final cumulative mortality exceeding 90%, in association with high viral loads (1 x 105 to 3 x 107 copies of virus mg-1) in dead individuals. For the first time, an infective inoculum was produced from frozen oysters (tissues stored at -80 degrees C for 6 mo). Storage of purified viral inoculum at +4 degrees C for 3 mo provided similar results to use of fresh inoculum, whereas storage at -20 degrees C, -80 degrees C and room temperature was detrimental to infectivity. A dose-response relationship for OsHV-1 was identified but further research is recommended to determine the most appropriate viral concentration for development of infection models that would be used for different purposes. Overall, this work highlights the best practices and potential issues that may occur in the development of a reproducible and transferable infection model for studying the pathogenicity of the Australian OsHV-1 strain in Crassostrea gigas under experimental conditions.",0
"A reliable and sensitive method based on solid-phase extraction was developed for the simultaneous detection of florfenicol (FF) and its metabolite florfenicol amine (FFA) in market fish samples. Fish samples were extracted with ethyl acetate. Lipids were removed from the extracts using hexane, followed by cleaning via solid-phase extraction and derivatization with BSTFA + TMCS [(N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide) + trimethylchlorosiane, (99:1)]; the fish samples then underwent gas chromatography with electron impact ionization mass spectrometric detection in the selected ion-monitoring mode, using 1 target and 3 qualifier ions. The method was validated according to EU Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Mean recovery ranged from 84.09 to 100.9 %, with a coefficient of variation <2.7 when samples were spiked at 3 different concentrations. The decision limits and detection capability of the method were 534 and 585 mug kg-1 for FF and 541 and 602 mug kg-1 for FFA, respectively. This validated method was successfully applied for the analysis of FF and FFA residues in fish samples obtained from local markets in Turkey. Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",0
"Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factors (TRAFs) are a family of crucial adaptors, playing vital roles in mediating signal transduction in immune signaling pathways, including RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. In the present study, a new TRAF family member (CgTRAF2) was identified in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that CgTRAF2 could be a new member of the invertebrate TRAF2 family. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that CgTRAF2 mRNA was highly expressed in the digestive gland, gills, and hemocytes, and it was significantly up-regulated after Vibrio alginolyticus and ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) challenge. The CgTRAF2 mRNA expression profile in different developmental stages of oyster larvae suggested that CgTRAF2 could function in early larval development. CgTRAF2 mRNA expression pattern, after the silence of CgMAVS (Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling) -like, indicated that CgTRAF2 might function downstream of CgMAVS-like. Moreover, the subcellular localization analysis revealed that CgTRAF2 was localized in cytoplasm, and it may play predominately important roles in signal transduction. Collectively, these results demonstrated that CgTRAF2 might play important roles in the innate immunity and larval development of the Pacific oyster.",0
"The ultrastructure and carotenoid-bearing structures of mamey sapote (Pouteria sapota) chromoplasts were elucidated using light and transmission electron microscopy and compared to carotenoid deposition forms in red bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Globular-tubular chromoplasts of sapote contained numerous lipid globules and tubules embodying unique provitamin A keto-carotenoids in a lipid-dissolved and presumably liquid-crystalline form, respectively. Bioaccessibility of sapotexanthin and cryptocapsin was compared to that of structurally related keto-carotenoids from red bell pepper and salmon. Capsanthin from bell pepper was the most bioaccessible pigment, followed by sapotexanthin and cryptocapsin esters from mamey sapote. In contrast, astaxanthin from salmon was the least bioaccessible keto-carotenoid. Thermal treatment and fat addition consistently enhanced bioaccessibility, except for astaxanthin from naturally lipid-rich salmon, which remained unaffected. Although the provitamin A keto-carotenoids from sapote were highly bioaccessible, their qualitative and quantitative in vivo bioavailability and their conversion to vitamin A remains to be confirmed.",0
"The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is a major parasite of salmonid fish in the marine environment. The interaction between the parasite and the host upon infection is not completely understood. However, it is clear that the parasite influences the host and its immune system. Prostaglandins produced by parasites such as flatworms, roundworms and ticks are documented or assumed to play a role in immunomodulation of the host. In the salmon louse, the effect of prostaglandins on the host is assumed, but remains to be documented. In this study, a salmon louse prostaglandin E2 synthase (LsPGES2) is characterized. Ontogenetic analysis showed that LsPGES2 is relatively stable expressed during development. The highest level of expression was seen in the free living stages, although elevated levels of LsPGES2 were also found in adult females. In copepodids, LsPGES2 is found around muscle cells, while it is observed in the reproductive organs of adult female lice. LsPGES2 expression was knocked-down by RNA interference in nauplii, but emerging copepodids did not display any changes in morphology nor ability to infect and develop to adult stages on fish. Additional knock-down of LsPGES2 in adult female lice did not produce any characteristic changes in phenotype nor reproductive output. It is concluded that under these experimental conditions, knock-down of LsPGES2 did not affect any essential functions of the salmon louse, neither in the free-living nor the parasitic stages.",0
"AIMS: The microbiota surviving sanitation of salmon-processing conveyor belts was identified and its growth dynamics further investigated in a model mimicking processing surfaces in such plants. METHODS AND RESULTS: A diverse microbiota dominated by Gram-negative bacteria was isolated after regular sanitation in three salmon processing plants. A cocktail of 14 bacterial isolates representing all genera isolated from conveyor belts (Listeria, Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Brochothrix, Serratia, Acinetobacter, Rhodococcus and Chryseobacterium) formed stable biofilms on steel coupons (12 degrees C, salmon broth) of about 10(9) CFU cm(-2) after 2 days. High-throughput sequencing showed that Listeria monocytogenes represented 0.1-0.01% of the biofilm population and that Pseudomonas spp dominated. Interestingly, both Brochothrix sp. and a Pseudomonas sp. dominated in the surrounding suspension. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota surviving sanitation is dominated by Pseudomonas spp. The background microbiota in biofilms inhibit, but do not eliminate L. monocytogenes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results highlights that sanitation procedures have to been improved in the salmon-processing industry, as high numbers of a diverse microbiota survived practical sanitation. High-throughput sequencing enables strain level studies of population dynamics in biofilm.",1
"An emerging focus in environmental toxicology is how climate change will alter bioavailability and uptake of contaminants in organisms. Ectothermic animals unable to adjust their temperature by local migration, such as farmed fish kept in net pens, may become more vulnerable to contaminants in warmer seas. The aim of this work was to study cadmium (Cd) toxicity in cells obtained from fish acclimated to sub-optimal growth temperature. Atlantic salmon hepatocytes, harvested from fish pre-acclimated either at 15 degrees C (optimal growth temperature) or 20 degrees C (heat-stressed), were exposed in vitro to two concentrations of Cd (control, 1 and 100microM Cd) for 48h. Cd-induced cytotoxicity, determined with the xCELLigence system, was more pronounced in cells from fish pre-acclimated to a high temperature than in cells from fish grown at optimal temperature. A feed spiked with antioxidants could not ameliorate the Cd-induced cytotoxicity in cells from temperature-stressed fish. At the transcriptional level, Cd exposure affected 11 out of 20 examined genes, of which most are linked to oxidative stress. The transcriptional levels of a majority of the altered genes were changed in cells harvested from fish grown at sub-optimal temperature. Interaction effects between Cd exposure and fish pre-acclimation temperature were seen for four transcripts, hmox1, mapk1, fth1 and mmp13. Overall, this study shows that cells from temperature-stressed fish are modestly more vulnerable to Cd stress, and indicate that mechanisms linked to oxidative stress may be differentially affected in temperature-stressed cells.",0
"Consistent individual differences in behaviour have been well documented in a variety of animal taxa, but surprisingly little is known about the fitness and life-history consequences of such individual variation. In wild salmonids, the timing of fry emergence from gravel spawning nests has been suggested to be coupled with individual behavioural traits. Here, we further investigate the link between timing of spawning nest emergence and behaviour of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), test effects of social rearing environment on behavioural traits in fish with different emergence times, and assess whether behavioural traits measured in the laboratory predict growth, survival, and migration status in the wild. Atlantic salmon fry were sorted with respect to emergence time from artificial spawning nest into three groups: early, intermediate, and late. These emergence groups were hatchery-reared separately or in co-culture for four months to test effects of social rearing environment on behavioural traits. Twenty fish from each of the six treatment groups were then subjected to three individual-based behavioural tests: basal locomotor activity, boldness, and escape response. Following behavioural characterization, the fish were released into a near-natural experimental stream. Results showed differences in escape behaviour between emergence groups in a net restraining test, but the social rearing environment did not affect individual behavioural expression. Emergence time and social environment had no significant effects on survival, growth, and migration status in the stream, although migration propensity was 1.4 to 1.9 times higher for early emerging individuals that were reared separately. In addition, despite individuals showing considerable variation in behaviour across treatment groups, this was not translated into differences in growth, survival, and migration status. Hence, our study adds to the view that fitness (i.e., growth and survival) and life-history predictions from laboratory measures of behaviour should be made with caution and ideally tested in nature.",0
"The inclusion of intact phospholipids in the diet is essential during larval development and can improve culture performance of many fish species. The effects of supplementation of dietary phospholipid from marine (krill) or plant (soy lecithin) sources were investigated in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. First feeding fry were fed diets containing either krill oil or soybean lecithin supplying phospholipid at 2.6%, 3.2%, 3.6% and 4.2% of diet. Fish were sampled at ~ 2.5 g (~1,990 degrees day post fertilization, dpf) and ~10 g (2,850 degrees dpf). By comparison of the intestinal transcriptome in specifically chosen contrasts, it was determined that by 2,850 degrees dpf fish possessed a profile that resembled that of mature and differentiated intestinal cell types with a number of changes specific to glycerophospholipid metabolism. It was previously shown that intact phospholipids and particularly phosphatidylcholine are essential during larval development and that this requirement is associated with the inability of enterocytes in young fry to endogenously synthesize sufficient phospholipid for the efficient export of dietary lipid. In the immature phase (~1,990 degrees dpf), the dietary phospholipid content as well as its class composition impacted on several biochemical and morphological parameters including growth, but these differences were not associated with differences in intestinal transcriptomes. The results of this study have made an important contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms associated with lipid transport and phospholipid biosynthesis in early life stages of fish.",0
"Apoptosis has been primarily investigated in mammals, and little is known about apoptosis in mollusks. The proteins Bax and Bak play critical roles in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and in determining cell fate. In this study, ChBax and ChBak, homologs of the well-known Bax and Bak proteins, were identified from the oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis. The ChBax/Bak proteins consist of 207/232 amino acids with the typical domains found in BCL-2 family members. ChBax and ChBak mRNA expression were detected in all 8 of the selected oyster tissues and at the different stages of development. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that the full-length proteins of ChBax/Bak were located in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial outer membrane, of HEK293T cells, respectively. Furthermore, both of the genes' expression levels were found to increase in the hemocytes of oysters challenged with pathogens. The over-expression of ChBax or ChBak activates the p53-Luc reporter gene in HEK293T cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that ChBax and ChBak may play important roles in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in oysters.",0
"Antimicrobials are heavily used in Chilean salmon aquaculture. We previously found significant differences in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria between sediments from an aquaculture and a non-aquaculture site. We now show that levels of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) are significantly higher in antimicrobial-selected marine bacteria than in unselected bacteria from these sites. While ARG in tetracycline- and florfenicol-selected bacteria from aquaculture and non-aquaculture sites were equally frequent, there were significantly more plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes per bacterium and significantly higher numbers of qnrB genes in quinolone-selected bacteria from the aquaculture site. Quinolone-resistant urinary Escherichia coli from patients in the Chilean aquacultural region were significantly enriched for qnrB (including a novel qnrB gene), qnrS, qnrA and aac(6')-1b, compared with isolates from New York City. Sequences of qnrA1, qnrB1 and qnrS1 in quinolone-resistant Chilean E. coli and Chilean marine bacteria were identical, suggesting horizontal gene transfer between antimicrobial-resistant marine bacteria and human pathogens.",1
"The aquatic orthomyxovirus infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) causes a severe disease in farmed Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. Although some ISA outbreaks are caused by horizontal transmission of virus between farms, the source and reservoir of the virus is largely unknown and a wild host has been hypothesized. Atlantic salmon are farmed in open net-pens, allowing transmission of pathogens from wild fish and the surrounding environment to the farmed fish. In this study, a large number of fish species were investigated for ISAV host potential. For orthomyxoviruses, a specific receptor binding is the first requirement for infection; thus, the fish species were investigated for the presence of the ISAV receptor. The receptor was found to be widely distributed across the fish species. All salmonids expressed the receptor. However, only some of the cod-like and perch-like fish did, and all flat fish were negative. In the majority of the positive species, the receptor was found on endothelial cells and/or on red blood cells. The study forms a basis for further investigations and opens up the possibility for screening species to determine whether a wild host of ISAV exists.",1
"Dissolved copper is one of the more pervasive and toxic constituents of stormwater runoff and is commonly found in stream, estuary, and coastal marine habitats of juvenile salmon. While stormwater runoff does not usually carry copper concentrations high enough to result in acute lethality, they are of concern because sublethal concentrations of copper exposure have been shown to both impair olfactory function and alter behavior in various species in freshwater. To compare these results to other environments that salmon are likely to encounter, experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of salinity on the impairment of olfactory function and avoidance of copper. Copper concentrations well within the range of those found in urban watersheds, have been shown to diminish or eliminate the olfactory response to the amino acid, l-serine in freshwater using electro-olfactogram (EOG) techniques. The olfactory responses of both freshwater-phase and seawater-phase coho and seawater-phase Chinook salmon, were tested in freshwater or seawater, depending on phase, and freshwater-phase coho at an intermediate salinity of 10 per thousand. Both 10 per thousand salinity and full strength seawater protected against the effects of 50mug copper/L. In addition to impairing olfactory response, copper has also been shown to alter salmon behavior by causing an avoidance response. To determine whether copper will cause avoidance behavior at different salinities, experiments were conducted using a multi-chambered experimental tank. The circular tank was divided into six segments by water currents so that copper could be contained within one segment yet fish could move freely between them. The presence of individual fish in each of the segments was counted before and after introduction of dissolved copper (<20mug/L) to one of the segments in both freshwater and seawater. To address whether use of preferred habitat is altered by the presence of copper, experiments were also conducted with a submerged structural element. The presence of sub-lethal levels of dissolved copper altered the behavior of juvenile Chinook salmon by inducing an avoidance response in both freshwater and seawater. While increased salinity is protective against loss of olfactory function from dissolved copper, avoidance could potentially affect behaviors beneficial to growth, survival and reproductive success.",0
"A patient in Washington State harbored a fish tapeworm most likely acquired from eating raw salmon. Diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense was identified by cox1 sequence analysis. Although this is the first documented human D. nihonkaiense infection in the United States, the parasite may have been present earlier but misidentified as Diphyllobothrium latum.",1
"Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is an emerging disease in North European Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus 1758) aquaculture caused by the amoeba Paramoeba perurans. The host immune response to AGD infection is still not well understood despite past attempts to investigate host-pathogen interactions. With the significant increase in our knowledge of cytokine genes potentially involved in Th responses in recent years, we examined their involvement in this disease using Atlantic salmon post-smolts sampled 3 weeks after exposure to either 500 or 5000 cells/l P. perurans. Gene expression analysis of cytokines potentially involved in the different Th pathways was performed on the first gill arch including the interbranchial lymphoid tissue (ILT). Th1, Th17 and Treg pathways were found to be significantly down regulated, mainly in samples from fish given the higher dose. In contrast, the Th2 pathway was found to be significantly up regulated by both infection doses. Correlation analysis of the gene expression data and the P. perurans load, assessed by real time RT-PCR of the 18S rRNA, was also performed. In humans, Th2 driven responses are characterized by the production of IgE, which in the majority of worm infections results in the generation of a Th2-mediated response and directs the immune system away from a Th1 inflammatory response. The present results seen during late stage AGD suggest that either an immune evasion strategy, similar to the responses driven by helminthic parasites to avoid cell-mediated killing mechanisms, or an allergic reaction caused by the parasite, is occurring.",1
This article explores the possible health risks of ethoxyquin in farmed salmon. Aspects considered include: carcinogenic risks and neurotoxic effects; maximum residue levels (MRLs); regulatory updates on the use of ethoxyquin as feed additive; and risk assessment of ethoxyquin in salmon and other sea foods.,1
"Pleurotus ostreatus is an edible mushroom that also has high medicinal values. In this study, P. ostreatus was tested for its ability to inhibit the growth of fungi and bacteria. The freeze-dried fruiting body, broth from submerged culture, and mycelial biomass of P. ostreatus were extracted using alcohols and water as solvents. The extracts were then tested for their antimicrobial activity against the growth of fungi and bacteria. It was observed that the water extract from fruiting bodies had the strongest effect in inhibiting the growth of most fungi. The most sensitive test microfungi to the inhibition were Candida albicans, Cryptococcus humicola, and Trichosporon cutaneum, and the most sensitive test bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus followed by Escherichia coli. Water extracts from culture broth or mycelial biomass were moderately inhibitive to the growth of fungi and bacteria. The alcohol-based solvents from all samples had much less antimicrobial activity against most test microorganisms. An antimicrobial compound was purified from the water extracts of fruiting bodies with Sephadex G 100 column chromatography and characterized by infrared absorption spectrum (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectroscopic analysis. We have identified this compound to be 3-(2-aminopheny1thio)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid. This purified compound had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 30 microg/mL and 20 microg/mL against the growth of fungi and bacteria, respectively.",0
"Species of Alexandrium produce potent neurotoxins termed paralytic shellfish toxins and are expanding their ranges worldwide, concurrent with increases in sea surface temperature. The metabolism of molluscs is temperature dependent, and increases in ocean temperature may influence both the abundance and distribution of Alexandrium and the dynamics of toxin uptake and depuration in shellfish. Here, we conducted a large-scale study of the effect of temperature on the uptake and depuration of paralytic shellfish toxins in three commercial oysters (Saccostrea glomerata and diploid and triploid Crassostrea gigas, n = 252 per species/ploidy level). Oysters were acclimated to two constant temperatures, reflecting current and predicted climate scenarios (22 and 27 degrees C), and fed a diet including the paralytic shellfish toxin-producing species Alexandrium minutum. While the oysters fed on A. minutum in similar quantities, concentrations of the toxin analogue GTX1,4 were significantly lower in warm-acclimated S. glomerata and diploid C. gigas after 12 days. Following exposure to A. minutum, toxicity of triploid C. gigas was not affected by temperature. Generally, detoxification rates were reduced in warm-acclimated oysters. The routine metabolism of the oysters was not affected by the toxins, but a significant effect was found at a cellular level in diploid C. gigas. The increasing incidences of Alexandrium blooms worldwide are a challenge for shellfish food safety regulation. Our findings indicate that rising ocean temperatures may reduce paralytic shellfish toxin accumulation in two of the three oyster types; however, they may persist for longer periods in oyster tissue.",1
"Ocean acidification and global warming have been shown to significantly affect the physiological performances of marine calcifiers; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, the transcriptome and biomineralization responses of Pinctada fucata to elevated CO2 (pH 7.8 and pH 7.5) and temperature (25 degrees C and 31 degrees C) are investigated. Increases in CO2 and temperature induced significant changes in gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, net calcification rates and relative calcium content, whereas no changes are observed in the shell ultrastructure. ""Ion and acid-base regulation"" related genes and ""amino acid metabolism"" pathway respond to the elevated CO2 (pH 7.8), suggesting that P. fucata implements a compensatory acid-base mechanism to mitigate the effects of low pH. Additionally, ""anti-oxidation""-related genes and ""Toll-like receptor signaling"", ""arachidonic acid metabolism"", ""lysosome"" and ""other glycan degradation"" pathways exhibited responses to elevated temperature (25 degrees C and 31 degrees C), suggesting that P. fucata utilizes anti-oxidative and lysosome strategies to alleviate the effects of temperature stress. These responses are energy-consuming processes, which can lead to a decrease in biomineralization capacity. This study therefore is important for understanding the mechanisms by which pearl oysters respond to changing environments and predicting the effects of global climate change on pearl aquaculture.",0
