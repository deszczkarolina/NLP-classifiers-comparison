No one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their  legal weapons. The Dividians had survived a change in leadership  before so even if Koresch himself would have been convicted and  sent to jail, they still could have carried on.     I don't think the Dividians were insane, but I don't see a reason  for mass suicide (if the fire was intentional set by some of the  Dividians.) We also don't know that, if the fire was intentionally  set from inside, was it a generally know plan or was this something  only an inner circle knew about, or was it something two or three  felt they had to do with or without Koresch's knowledge/blessing, etc.?  I don't know much about Masada. Were some people throwing others over?  Did mothers jump over with their babies in their arms?     Richard          "

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to  see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness  but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than  those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from  my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)  which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get  an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To  control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since  I was used to slow pitch, I didn't come close (actually I think  I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people  like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are  not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the  results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major  league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test  whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was ""better"" -  but I don't know the results.  (The woman who ran the study I was in  said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major  leaguers than across the general population - but I'm not sure  whether I'd believe her.)

0,"  This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything  evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open  algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start  panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but  I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts  explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and  long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to  subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the  administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and  RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much  wider than us computer geeks.    The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:    1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just      now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.    2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able      to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I      find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy      for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the      administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for      all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made      widely available.)    Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):  >This new technology will help companies protect proprietary  >information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations  >and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted  >electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the  >ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to  >intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.     The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems to  pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone  know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog  signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.    The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements  symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?    I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it  is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level  encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate  a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted  third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session  key?)    If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover  all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting  royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the  algorithm secret? :-)  --  Marc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM accepted  Kirk:  I won't hurt you.

In comparison, in   the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall   decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in   gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of   this disease from 1985 through 1992.        In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department   of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,   reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively   (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics   (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases   with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%   of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by   age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or   equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all   reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the   largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age   group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).        Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver   metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the   state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area   occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods   considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency   syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.        When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among   men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in   the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits   by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases   diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,   the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised   94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among   self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,   respectively).        Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,   university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted   to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea   culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased   23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the   fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).        From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and   Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado   increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,   the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for   whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)   (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from   1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases   increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.     Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE   Hoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD,   Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br,   Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for   Prevention Svcs, CDC.     Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992   may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more   complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH   surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea   cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories   suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.   However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning   laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the   gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.        One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in   Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a   recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs   (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area   coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires   further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated   previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)   -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom   gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,   and gang affiliation.        The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the   national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective   19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for   gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at   greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-  specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as   socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.        In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,   interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting   partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at   increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black   males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in   schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted   primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to   perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational   interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of   members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders   and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety   belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50   states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety   belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by   an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major   cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of   occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for   those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In   addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to   use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between   adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints   for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC   analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System   (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this   study.        Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to   18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,   random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury   Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499   (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent   was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for   that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in   this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than   consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).   Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software   for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates   and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined   by p values of less than 0.05.        Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six   (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no   law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,   and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a   vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse   of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary   enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a   safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states   used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.   The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law   requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law   (no-law states).        Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not   consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and   adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square   test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus   43.2%, respectively).        High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1   year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than   consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported   high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age   (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for   adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-  occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%   for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of   consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult   safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age   groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).        Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded   that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,   higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with   increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated   with increased adult safety-belt use (8).     Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National   Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.     Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others   indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely   to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these   nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit   other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater   risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).        Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with   child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs   should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low   educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such   programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve   low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are   directed at parents with young children.        Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In   addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,   those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do   not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety   belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and   safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may   increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --   the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the   highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                 IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                           AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88          Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance   systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.        Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance   in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for   the years 1983-1988.        Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program   and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-  based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The   prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-  1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan   Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,   sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.        Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal   alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the   kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general   diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand   limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are   probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these   defects are relatively easy to diagnose.        Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy   termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,   the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be   related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene   pool, or random variation.        Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several   collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in   the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on   the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89         Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza   virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually   from October through May.        Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance   conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.        Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices   of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO   collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza   viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and   territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.   Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received   throughout the year.        Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B   viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency   overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted   over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices   of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were   similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of   identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype   increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the   1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were   reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza   A(H1N1).        Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of   influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the   importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since   amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.        Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced   throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make   informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual   surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates   for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.   Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                     High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies    Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-  ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been   developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),   embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,   these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive   technology (ART) procedures.     Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or   pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility   management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to   proceed with one of the ART procedures.     Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility   service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and   Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in   ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients   in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the   traditional therapies.     The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our   Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the   realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:     o in vitro   o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube     transfer   o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.   This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed   towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then   subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA   amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.     There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by   other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and   hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ   hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of   which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit   sex-linked disorders.     The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that   it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility   of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth   of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our   Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of   unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and   the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred   to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under   strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being   processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our   andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to   perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically   stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing   hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo   lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs   obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic   egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,   we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our   Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.         Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal   deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male   factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall   success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per   cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173   IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.        Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is   disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological   factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well   recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous   ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle   attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant   of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an   Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of   traditional therapies.        The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not   been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs   available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates   significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;   and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is   unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our   Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may   be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that   fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant   proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,   the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our   program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs   of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.          GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,   usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves   introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian   tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization   occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,   with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for   transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such   pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility   and/or idiopathic infertility.           The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990   indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained   with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36   percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might   expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our   program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while   substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the   patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing   a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing   general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from   obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,   and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.        The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial   environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between   January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT   cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.        Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when   embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.   This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for   success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical   issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated   by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from   both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs   should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.        Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,   is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but   who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in   combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10   percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the   procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under   the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm   through enzymatic digestion.        Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10   percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly   relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.   Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques   for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation.

Phil        ------- Forwarded Message    Subject: text of White House announcement and Q&As on clipper chip encryption    Note:  This file will also be available via anonymous file  transfer from csrc.ncsl.nist.gov in directory /pub/nistnews and  via the NIST Computer Security BBS at 301-948-5717.       ---------------------------------------------------                             THE WHITE HOUSE                      Office of the Press Secretary    _________________________________________________________________    For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993                      STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY      The President today announced a new initiative that will bring  the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary  program to improve the security and privacy of telephone  communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law  enforcement.    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to  accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure  telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.    For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our  private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the  tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of  protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate  the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and  law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against  industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.    Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to  protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to  protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption  technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the  unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used  by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.    A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" has  been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a  new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,  relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to  an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications  using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in  commercial use today.    This new technology will help companies protect proprietary  information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations  and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted  electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the  ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to  intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.     A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the  ""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding  Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                      2      ""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized government  agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the  device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately  in two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by the  Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to  government officials with legal authorization to conduct a  wiretap.    The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with no  new authorities to access the content of the private  conversations of Americans.    To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the  Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new  devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the  government will be offered access to the confidential details of  the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report  their findings.    The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of  encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the  privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield  criminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and other  approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access  to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it  to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology  trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),  the President has directed government agencies to develop a  comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:         --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to            employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;         --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone            calls and data, under proper court or other legal            order, when necessary to protect our citizens;         --   the effective and timely use of the most modern            technology to build the National Information            Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and            the competitiveness of American industry in the global            marketplace; and          --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export            high technology products.    The President has directed early and frequent consultations with  affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the  privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                        3    The Administration is committed to working with the private  sector to spur the development of a National Information  Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer  technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to  information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks  (""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTV  programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone  system transmits voice.    Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important  role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act  quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding  its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that  protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting  them from those who break the law.    Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.   The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new  encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with       no new authorities to access the content of the private       conversations of Americans.    Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on       a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation       encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to       decipher the message?    A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a       court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They       would then present documentation of this authorization to       the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and       obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug       smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are       stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key       escrow system.    Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?    A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent       entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the       Administration have yet to determine which agencies will       oversee the key-escrow data banks.    Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure       how strong the security is?      A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption       systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will       remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow       system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of       cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all       potential users that there are no unrecognized       vulnerabilities.    Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?    A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the       Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in       this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the       President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet       officials.    Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?    A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on       encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify       as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have       briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the       decisions related to this initiative.    Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?    A:   The government designed and developed the key access       encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the       microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product       manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip       manufacturer that produces them.    Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?    A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,       California, and will sell the chip to encryption device       manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed       to other vendors in the future.    Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?     A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating       the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.         Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological       solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be       willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more       powerful encryption devices?    A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be       considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow       mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product       that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive       than others readily available today, but it is just one       piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to       encryption technology, which the Administration is       developing.         The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption       threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,       we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have       effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every       American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an       unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a       false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is       an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,       and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,       balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper       Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.    Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton       Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from       that of the Bush Administration?      A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption       technology in telecommunications and computing and are       committed to working with industry and public-interest       groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'       privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law       enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime       and terrorism.    Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use       the government hardware?    A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control       requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is       required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The       same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the       attractions of this technology is the protection it can give       to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this       in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a       case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these       devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan       to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability       of these products. "

As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993""   (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space   business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.      In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had   shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are   driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are   projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7   satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also   projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,   and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to   $450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward   revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                                Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,   revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to   increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from   broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products   and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad   report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite   manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth   $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual   projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market   sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very   successful in regaining international market share in the satellite   business.      Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in   the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-  year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including   such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)   appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually   publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and   the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released   then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if   the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the   numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.      Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite   promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top   $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct   broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite   station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year   through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic   for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for   substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the   next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative   assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and   satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the   current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite   market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will   be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive   as currently projected.)      It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first   release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research   facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for   the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space   Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first   sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]     2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS     McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta   launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola   Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to   launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO   communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas   was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.      The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium   constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium   satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be   launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle   launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be   launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.    Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a   planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although   details of the launch services contract were reported to be   negotiation, and not yet final.      The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of   their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5   million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36   launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These   launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global   Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other   programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is   expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected   to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.    Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand""   services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to   occur within 40 days of the request.       [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should   provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program   through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have   a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and   sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts   for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA   Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping   MDC as a viable commerical launch company.       However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these   contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has   not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for   operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing   and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these   approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.    But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.      Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of   several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of   the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III   program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this   time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future   funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts   is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy   reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and   Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs   (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter""   program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget   deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to   find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]      3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""     The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing   satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of   Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to   WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and   operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral   images of the Earth.      [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture   by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the   operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the   request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new   venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to   provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into   digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable   customers for this service include exploration geologists,   agricultural planners, and urban planners.       It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the   1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last   November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote   sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to   this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to   all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures   would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.      There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote   sensing ventures working their way through the system at different   stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite   systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing   data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,   government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures   such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use   innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the   margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures   appearing in the next year or so.]                      4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT""      Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General   Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,   despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent   analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever   convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical   95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-  generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate   management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are   cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and   $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of   capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.      [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has   hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has   restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,   many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might   be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space   Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current   problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected   to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of   about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space   launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability   of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits   from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur   program is back on track, this division will continue to show   substantial losses.      In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation   is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.    To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional   management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.    In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management   team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with   the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would   indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch   operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince   customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would   have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in   marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for   this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly   McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash   flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction   (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),   or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the   $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of   change for any company.]      5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND     Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is   projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early   February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which   detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the   next decade.      Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant   position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54   international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane   holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14   contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long   March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.      Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can   compete are projected to come from communications satellites with   the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and   scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand   growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.      Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of   individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will   continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with   larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.   Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications   satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to   about 3000 kg in GEO.      Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain   strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the   decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace   bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder   demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques   appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing   or near-term transponders.      One of the significant possible changes in the market was   identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian   launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,   investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade   off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and   other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities   and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.      [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and   I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.    Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in   the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new   data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical   transponders on orbit.     I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-  based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While   fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the   established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing   demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-  multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space   transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability   service, but only from established point A to established point B.   To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable   between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,   installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost   millions or billions of dollars.       For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground   network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective   solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is   cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of   thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite   network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and   has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is   growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,   it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to   handle the increase in traffic.      Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still   growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But   satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current   generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of   on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from   last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch   demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite   launches over longer intervals.      And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it   looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-  supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual   commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites   per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up   to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of   about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,   Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other   systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per   year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.      We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial   launches.]    6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT      The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has   spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety   rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt   the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation   of range safety rules.       In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of   two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure   typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at   Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute   before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was   overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the   communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the   valid abort call.      Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort   command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an   investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to   launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.      Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety   Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This   investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an   incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their   investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at   lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used   in the launch.     [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an   investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested   by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space   Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.       At the time of writing this column, some of the initial   investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are   starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four   different communications channels were in use during the test. After   the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test   director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops   Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.    According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.   Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the   NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying   the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing   explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the   best set being that clear lines of communications and clear   definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and   understanding of the mission rules were not established before the   launch.       As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these   procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.     This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has   been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they   do with commercial aircraft problems).       I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with   procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance   of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how   specific lines of authority should be delineated.]     7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED     Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new   small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.    Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos""   winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"",   launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is   projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to   an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430   kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used   with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called   'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military   establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of   spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the   Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia   facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.      [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new   venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking   for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house   knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous   commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.      This one's a little different in that they are offering variants   of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being   targeted or substantial financial backing.]    8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING     In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the   results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial   rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland   Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary   study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch   site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected   low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic   considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal   for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.      [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the   Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still   proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland   found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if   substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected   returns were too low to justify the cost of development.       This might point out some key discriminators in judging the   feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:    - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage   sufficient to recover setup costs?    - Is there a market advantage of using the site?    - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?    - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the   investment?       Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at   Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore   Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against   these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying   on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]    9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING     In one of his last official acts, former President Bush   authorized space technology transfer for several joint space   ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed   use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that   regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch   vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first   launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as   a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into   LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,   including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.    Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in   development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor   launch vehicle as well as from the US.      [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity   in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small   payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either   Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.    However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout   program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the   Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on   system).       This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch   system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of   such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies   have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche   Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the   Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to   find any other European development work with even a rumor of   funding for hardware.      Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the   Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting   rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space   launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled   the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.      What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally   transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new   civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de   Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described   as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket   program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German   firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq   in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and   tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package   lagged that of the propulsion system.      It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first   scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B   satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes   cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has   yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air   launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this   contract.]     10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP     PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in   late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract   from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2   launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar   Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish   Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and   offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According   to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya   launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-  enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like   the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main   alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service   to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the   Swedish satellite was not specified.      [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and   funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a   small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From   PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series   rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar   MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a   225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.       PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its   first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and   2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired   TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary   engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder   closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same   building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,   launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.   Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the   board of directors.       PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least   $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been   searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to   design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.      The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help   bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need   much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real   hardware.]     11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED      In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications   venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.    As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),   headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist   Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China   Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional   communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite   system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the   satellite's communications channels.       [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the   release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid   January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of   Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg   scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional   satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has   been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530   M) through 2006.       I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this   venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.    While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the   current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two   separate sastellite ventures.      The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat-  2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing   Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and   other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational   model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing   venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to   Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later   satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between   Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture   through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to   proceed.      In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with   substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This   is just another indicator to add to the list.]     12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES     South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently   announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and   another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for   advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been   specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with   manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by   1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's   aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by   2000.                                      [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its   national aerospace industry, specifically including space   activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are   coming into the commercial space market.      As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications   satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995   on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide   television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,   southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.      South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on   Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US   $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of   this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""    Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-  monitoring micro-satellite.      This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth   observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)   project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean   government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with   optical and microwave sensors.     South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel   military effort to establish the capabilities for building and   launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a   government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,   funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an    expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the   Korean peninsula.            In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean   is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing   aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is   offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as   part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of   consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports   satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has   announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).       This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.    Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector   for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a   South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition   of commercial space market there over the next decade.]     13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH     As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the   results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and   investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of   March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the   market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%   of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a   general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The   increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which   is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this   trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite   well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms   which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its   results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the major  problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion  reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so  small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some  fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would  have to be processed.    This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon  as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't  content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,  average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the  market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.  This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.    On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11  and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...  terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in  titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and  sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are  *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the  world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If  even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2  at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti  basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon  could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the  ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being  mined today).

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at  full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want  less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable  you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This  requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could  probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply  instruction and a few other DSP things.    If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a  second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000  8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1  compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about  V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.  Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need  sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a  PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap  - you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the  SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't  sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation  a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be  required.    The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the  SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that  I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't  estimate how fast a PC you'd need.      --   Not all men who drink are poets.

Let us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does  this mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder  because he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent  supporter?    One of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system  was far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party  itself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was  noone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not  originaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it  until his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged  upon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of   his supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the  old guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications  of their rhetoric.     This is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must  be considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one ""race""  of people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of  humanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,  the gas chambers of Auschwitz.    The NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who  lead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the  evil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.  Hitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego  cult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however  mean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and  his propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can  produce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be   emphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between  a govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to   govern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the  latter as a ""strong"" government since most displays of strength are made  necessary by an essential weakness.    It is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they  amoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the  same manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause  of morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their  logic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties  such as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert  the truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates  of a system that would commit genocide.     The conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is  inescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let  the conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that  were basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of  the concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly  does not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.    No matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon   election those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.  If this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made  the pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates  a dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many  in government politics is a method of providing a justification for  their own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A   rhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the  continued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the  essential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli  which has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important  to realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right  and those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement  of popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.  In the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through  their assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.    It is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics  of political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The  leaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do  so voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a   task without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of  ones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore  in taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole  before personal concerns, even of personal security.    Although it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred  and an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit  genocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of  the system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility  of changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to   control a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot   affect the system.      Phill Hallam-Baker  Phill Hallam-Baker "

BUT unfortunately I am serving my duty in the army right now and  I think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if I take leaves   every day for two weeks for treatment.  Thus I bought the prescribed tablets  at some drugstore, but to cure it I must get INJECTION of <Streptomycin>, with  a dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days.  I can probably buy the   tools and this solution somewhere but I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO INJECTION BY MYSELF  !  Can any kind people here tell me:    If it's possible to do it? Can I do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip  only??  Any info is welcome and please write me or post your help SOON!! (I am  already taking the tablets ..and I can't wait!!)

Instead, it looks like that  >ill-gotten gain will be used to help pay for wiretap equipment.    I wholeheartedly agree.  Knowing that WE have let our law enforcement agencies  seize our property against the Fifth Amendment of OUR Constitution tells me that  we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for SELF-GOVERNANCE.  WE have  to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws  and rules only to better their positions within the government.  WE have allowed  them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  That situation has  to be changed.    Allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug  informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact  with the Devil himself.  It's a vicious cycle.  The law enforcement agencies are  motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  And having no easy  way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more  incentive for the agencies to take property.    It's also interesting to note that two months ago Rush Limbaugh said that  Clinton would have the ""plumbers"" out in force shortly.  Clinton and his  henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  Anytime a  leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that  control and take more.    WE have to take OUR government back.  Otherwise we will end up living in the  equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  We have to take  responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.           __  Paul J.

Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are  1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than  nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many  fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many  fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were  adopted (""why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."").    3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally  not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil  plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.    >       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual   >boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water,  >rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal   >pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".      Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants  of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the   heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in  order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is  normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is  desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because   moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine   low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity  causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest  pressure condensing environment is always the best.      A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where  the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the  condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the   condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too   hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into  steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a  particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all  costs.      The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant  in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower   they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in  the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120   degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is  used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower  system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water  is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,  operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order   to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher  hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the  condenser area.    At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the  air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge  water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water  from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and  humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water  temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical  ""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.  It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful  in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the  plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets  too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive  pressure.    >       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than   >cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.    True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and  feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard   stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves.  The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood  the costs of impure water.  By ""impure"", I mean water with a few  dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved  oxygen.

0,"  Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a  couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.  spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C  and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time  delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this  application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger  pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is  disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.  When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x  the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can  be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting  any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it  is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K  resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of  2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)  Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for  256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.  After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14  day timing cycle and so forth.    Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the  electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet  puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to  keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to  work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts  to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see  what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that  has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns  off ;-)    Thanks again everyone...    -=-= Wes =-=- "

The  distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people  whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these  soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And  resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich  were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).  Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by  resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the  Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the  hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the  Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the  only option they see as viable.

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the   area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population   of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were   Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.   Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third   of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the    Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan   uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians   as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,   however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the   guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000   inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character    notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian    Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the    southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts    into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable    and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets    completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for    howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the    scattered bones of the dead.""

No kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,  massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly   people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated   the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between   1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today   in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide   that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought   they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the   Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian   terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle   resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent  Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that   they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia   today.    A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri   town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to   have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military   operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the   Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been   massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten   and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed   the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian   insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the  Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City   hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant   were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to   condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its   sovereignty.    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

It is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial   distinction.    Indeed, I find the latter in absolute and complete contradiction  to the former.

On 19.3.93 my wife went to her General Practitioner (Doctor). He mentioned  an article from a medical journal that is of great interest to us. He had  read it in the previous three months but has been unable to find it again.  The article was about Whiplash Injury/Cervical Pain. It mentions the use of  a MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imagery) machine as a diagnostic tool and the work  of a neurosurgeon who relived cervical pain.  This article is most likely in an Australian medical journal. I very much  want to obtain the name of the article, journal and author because the case  matches my wife. We would very much appreciate anyone's help in this matter  via email preferably.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Gavin Anderson                              email: GAnderson@cmutual.com.au  Analyst/Programmer.                         phone: +61-3-607-6299  Colonial Mutual Life Aust.

We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that the  misguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly because  they are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their use  in violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-set  against the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumer  would be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congress  a LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can no  longer protect their citizens you can bet that the American people  will start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms.

Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't really  expect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are based  more on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (which  are generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on their  Birkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friends  are anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinions  on facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to the  contrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the world  more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They   would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how  society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They   support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum  who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society  or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun  control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun  control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they  have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront  the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that  are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't  accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making  significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly  hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different  tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.    >Surrender your arms. Soon enough, officers will be around to collect  >them. Resistance is useless. They will overwhelm you - one at a time.

L.   acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily   responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of   the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L.   bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are   much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told   me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several   different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't   told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative   anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a   chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria   around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal   region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida   blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from   the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do   believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower   colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the   competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.  Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get   rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A   supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the   good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the   pH to basically starve the candida out.

After a while we  got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -  electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last  guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400  meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters  (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt  bus.     But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a   lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would  spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those  Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the  low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with   silicone).     What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or  turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of  clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world  safer for electricans, anyway.

And I don't think ANY guilty  verdicts should have been returned. I'm sure you know why they handed  down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. It's quite simple really,  it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities  think it's right to riot. I hate to say this, but I would have liked to  see them riot with everyone prepared. It would be open season if your  skin was even slightly brown.

Eminent domain is a state-mandated transaction in which one party is  required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party,  regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all, at a price  which is set by the state.

You believe  that the courts, in deciding a civil dispute between two parties, should  consider as a factor -- perhaps as an overriding factor -- issues which  I believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute.  _Boomer v.  Atlantic Cement Co._ was an action brought by one party,  Boomer, whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by  another party, the Atlantic Cement Company.  The facts supported  Boomer's contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his  property, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop  doing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider  such issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to  do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage  faced by the plaintiffs.  Those issues had nothing to do with the case  before the court.    > Bill, if the government had stepped in and the EPA made a regulation  > requiring multi-million dollar cement plants to be shut down because  > of a smattering of cement dust, at a cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1,  > you'd be up in arms.

Quite the contrary, I'd  probably support the action, since it would be based on the same general  doctrine as the decision that I believe would have been correct in  _Boomer_: the idea that people's property rights should not be violated  for reasons of economic efficiency.  In _Boomer_ it was Boomer's  property rights which I believe the court should have protected; in the  hypothetical EPA ruling you've presented, it's the American people's  collective property rights in a healthy physical environment.  What  good is cost-benefit ratio of 15+:1 if you wind up with cement dust in  your air?    *  *  *  *  *    >>> Your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant.  >>> If the State of Massachusetts came up with a similar regulation,  >>> you'd be up in arms and complaining about interference with  >>> property rights, and Fifth Amendment violations.

Yes.  So what?  The courts are supposed to protect the specific rights  of individuals, not the general interests of some nebulous society.  If  society can have its cement plant without violating anyone's rights,  fine.  Otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less  cement plant.

""One wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with,  in order to minimize the transactions costs.""???  Which ""one"" are you  speaking of?  _I_ want the legal regime to protect people's rights.  Besides, Coase's Theorem only has real application in the never-never  land of perfectly rational actors.  In the real world (1) some people  are going to be stubborn, ornery, spiteful or otherwise ""irrational""  from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to  protect their right to be so.  I don't care if you can show me logically  that your cattle are only doing $100 of damage to my property per head,  so I should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for, say, $150  per head -- I still retain the right to tell you that I just plain don't  want any damned cattle on my property, not at any price.    *   *   *   *   *    >> And then you say: ""Everyone's property rights were protected; the  >> plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were  >> avoided.""

Why should we treat a nuisance  > plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff?  We don't  > require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation;  > why in tort?    Last question first: For the same reason as in contract law -- because  to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the Thirteenth  Amendment.    As to your ""Then, by your argument, no tort plaintiff is ever made  whole, because the award of damages in involuntary"" claim, you're at  least partially right.  Faced with situations in which the wrong has  already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place  and cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable  price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer  to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might  prefer).  In these cases, the ""sale"" has already taken place and is  irreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is  paid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should  even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and  (b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or  inequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be  worth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases  like _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it  are still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented  from happening at all) by order of the court.    In these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the  potential victim's property rights are protected until and unless he  agrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need  for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both  sides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the  parties themselves.    >> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the  >> business of ensuring that ""unnecessary"" settlement costs are avoided?  >> (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were  >> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)  >  > Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.    In cases like _Boomer_, they're simply a cost of doing business.  The  fact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into  a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a  result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant  without _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose  property rights they'd be violating via the operation of their plant.  There's nothing punitive or unjust about it.    >> (2) It is ""completely sensible"" only if you believe that the alleged  >> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid  >> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and  >> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to  >> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who  >> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.  >> [wdstarr]  >  > Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire  > set of possessions to wronged person?

Anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be  required to buy the right to do so from the victim, in advance.  And the  seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege.  No  injustice, no punitive damages.    *   *   *   *   *    >>> You'd like Posner, Bill.

Atlantic Cement wanted to be  able to _continue_ to violate Boomer's rights.  While the court may have  been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already  committed, it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the  _future_ violations of Boomer's rights and to then force Boomer to sell  at that price.    -- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>   "

Hundreds of books, articles, and    documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence    and death.

I knew him to be Turkey's man; due to my    reading knowledge of Turkish and my seniority over him, I was a member    of the promotion committee. For that case, I sat down and read his entire    treatise ""History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey"". It took me    three months and I found out, from volume I, that he had plagiarized     Uzun Jarsoglu, an eminent Turkish specialist on Ottoman history. Shaw    himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome     of a 20-year search through the Ottoman Archives. Well, I went on leave      and managed to show 40% of Volume I, containing around 5000 sentences,     to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages        from the original work. He had even reproduced the errors. So I produced a    500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on Shaw's plagiarism.       The University, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting,    promoted Stanford Shaw to Distinguished Professor. I paid a price for     all this: upset by the whole process, I confronted the entire University    structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. I asked for    permission to run a seminar on Shaw's book that was denied by the President    of the University. While the Center for Near Eastern Studies granted me    permission, the President was depriving me of my academic freedom. Luckily,    the Dean refused to give in and I did run the seminar, attended by more     than 150 academic people, in which I uncovered Stanford Shaw, who refused    to attend.

Are you saying that the Indians who became Christians did so because the  US Army marched them into church at gunpoint?    This will be news to the Indians of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi  basin-- of the Southwest-- of Mexico and South America-- who converted even  before there was such a thing as the US.  Are you saying that Indians are  incapable of coming to a decision themselves about their religion without  being forced to at gunpoint?  What about the Christian Cherokees who were  given the boot by the US government after the Civil War... because the  Cherokee nation gave mild support to the Confederacy, since they themselves  owned black slaves.  No, reducing it all to a matter of religion is to  support a much too narrow view of history.    I've never heard of a single treaty, whether broken by the US government or  not (were any NOT????), that said, if you guys convert to Christianity, you  get to keep all the land you claim.  No, treaties were invariably about land...  it meant ceding Indian claims to the government.  Sometimes in return the  US government promised the hunter-gatherer tribes (and plenty of tribes were  already farming for centuries, but we don't hear about non-Plains Indians  in movies) food and training in return for taking up a non-nomadic existence.  Promises, of course, which all to often proved empty.  "

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were  performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43  (Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results   indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground  station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.    2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the  Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received  properly.    3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the  spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS  (Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to  preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a  source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).    4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the  Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer  (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received  properly.    5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was  performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of  two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the  spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.    6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay  Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.  The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately  20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18  degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back  to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the  antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The  RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had  increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.         After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was  uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,  a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on  May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the  Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test  mini-sequence.    7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to  264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.    8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under  stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees  from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,  back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of  the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was  at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4  degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time  commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.    9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change  (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN  (3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These  measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special  anomaly team.    10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:           a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts         b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin         c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner         d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees             off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)         e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1         f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within             acceptable range         g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range         h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,             EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS         i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within             acceptable range         j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours             Time To Initiation - 203 hours      GDS (Ground Data Systems):    1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took  place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went  well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN  (Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was  successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with  DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).    2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development  Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current  Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going  cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months  accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant  schedule changes or significant problems were reported.      TRAJECTORY         As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory  status was as follows:    	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)  	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)  	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour  	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km  	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds    SPECIAL TOPIC    1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been  transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the  sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.  In the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated  in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command  process.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial  RRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the  stator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the  RRA slew test.       ___    _____     ___      /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov      | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |   ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand  /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and  |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF,   from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for   strong cryptography through a distinct organization.    The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex  and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the  contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged  models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin  already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one  step removed from the old ""crypto-wielding child molester"" argument.  An  EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the  connection to child pornography and the like.    Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In  light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it  stands to be labelled as ""communist"", ""anarchist hackers"", radical, etc.      I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social  Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical  antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political  baggage.    Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography  would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing  group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to  advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's  question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going  to do about it?    Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,  I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:  gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the  issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

That's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts  of people.    	What's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone  quality speech<->RS232 converter. Imagine, if you will, a little box that  takes data on its serial port and puts out sound, and takes sound and codes  it to signals on its serial port. Full duplex. Now, this device is not a  cryptographic device. It's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever  you want to call it. It's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications  for:  	a) speech synthesis (with a few nifty libraries and some samples)  	b) speech recording for electronic messaging  	c) building voicemail systems  	d) internet talk radio  	e) internet relay chat    	Of course, some of the electronic messaging in item b might be  encrypted, possibly realtime, but that's the user's decision. One would  need 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout  to switch over, and some code on, say, a 486 laptop.    	I'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive  internet talk radio could be done. Ideally, though, it should be a general  purpose device. It should be a general purpose enough device that nobody  should be able to balk at its widespread use. Obviously, to make it easy  for homebrewers, it should use pretty common hardware.    	It's interesting to note that I'd already talked with a couple  of folks about building such a thing, before this whole clipper thing  started. I even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are  able to make sample units, given incentive and some time. I'd envisioned  finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund  development of a public domain board layout and parts set, that could  be published in the form of CAD drawings for a couple of major CAD  packages, and in PostScript.    	Anyone interested? I'll start a provisional mailing list. Let  me know if you want on.    mjr. "

2,"  1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope  and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual  certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset  control's zero detent position.    2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many  generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest  flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm  terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector  on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out  .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may  also find that loading the output of the function generator also  reduces the harmonic distortion.    Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to  use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the  voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:    ------10K--------+---------? ohm ----                   |  Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.  (loaded)         |  -----------------+-------------------    Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy  to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You can  virtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have the  millivolt test generator you want.

EDT  	       	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know, the President is going   to come out at 1:15 p.m.  With your indulgence, I think what we'd   like to do is have the President award the National Teacher's Award   first and then have the teacher leave, or whatever, and then he'll   make a statement on Waco and take a couple questions.  So if we can   just hold off going live and all that until that's done, it probably   will work out a lot better.   	       	     Q	  If you'll give us the time.  That's the problem.  	       	     Q	  We've got a two-minute warning problem.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.  It's about   1:15 p.m.  	       	     Q	  The teacher would walk off and then --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's -- I'm just trying   to work this out here.  I think that's the best way to handle it.  	       	     Q	  Can I ask you a series of questions about the way   the President handled the notifications yesterday?   	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.  	       	     Q	  Did you, for instance, talk to the Justice   Department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in   Waco and whether it should be the Attorney General or the President?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Why don't we just take a step even   farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on   the contact between the Justice Department and the White House.  As   you know and as we've said, the President spoke with the Attorney   General on Sunday, Sunday afternoon.  They had a good discussion,   about 15 minutes.  The Attorney General informed the President of   what she wanted to do.  He raised no objections.  Obviously, she had   the implicit authority from the President to go forward.  He raised   no objections.  She went forward.  They had a discussion of a general   nature about the incident.  	       	     Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the   President spoke with the Attorney General again.  They had a brief   discussion over what was happening in Waco.  As you know, this was   before the fire broke out at the compound.  And I think that was why   there was some -- just some confusion.  I think that she was   confusing in her minds before and after the fire, not the actual day   when they spoke.    	       	     Then there was a number of contacts at a number of   different levels in the White House yesterday afternoon between the   Justice Department and the White House.  They were informing us of     their decisions, what they would like to do.  There was an FBI   briefing in Waco.  The Attorney General had her press conference.    The President then issued a statement after that.  	       	     Frankly, yesterday afternoon, you know, there was a fair   amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in   Waco, and I think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the   President say anything until we had a much better sense of what was   actually happening on the ground.  Once we were fairly clear on what   was happening on the ground in Waco, the President issued a   statement.  He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday   evening.  	       	     Q	  At what hour was that?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.  I believe it   was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.  He took a tour of   the Holocaust Museum last night.  	       	     Q	  And he went out to dinner.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.  Yes, he went to   dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.  I   don't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.  And he   just said, I think as Dee Dee has reported, that he just wanted to   tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well,   that she did a good job in a tough situation, and that she should try   and get some sleep.  He then, again, spoke with her this morning   about the follow-up in Waco, and about what they're going to do this   afternoon.  As you know, the President will have an announcement to   make at 1:15.  	       	     Q	  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last   night, or this morning?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.  	       	     Q	  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Webb Hubbell is the general White   House Liaison and several people talked to Webb.  The Attorney   General was running the operation.  	       	     Q	  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that   she had done a good job?  Or he just tell her that she should get   some sleep?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good   job -- I don't know the exact words.  I think that sounds right.  	       	     Q	  I mean, sleep well has implications as to   conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think everybody   feels badly when you have a situation when --  	       	     Q	  I understand that, but whether the issue of blame   is brought up in that phraseology.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it   has nothing to do with that.  The spirit with which it was offered   was that the entire administration and certainly the Attorney General   had to face a very difficult decision, a very difficult situation   yesterday.  And that he thought that she had handled it well, as best   as she could and --  	       	     Q	  Well, does he think it was mishandled?    	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm   words to a friend.  	       	     Q	  Does he think the situation was mishandled?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --  	       	     Q	  In retrospect?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President stands  by the   decisions of the law enforcement agencies, the decisions of the   Attorney General.  He accepts full responsibility.  At the same time,   I think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what   exactly happened, do a full review, and make sure we do what we can   to make sure this doesn't happen -- this kind of thing doesn't happen   again, or at least we know how to handle it.  	       	     Q	  How much did he know about what she was going to go   ahead with?  I know that she made the case to him -- explained --  outlined the case for action.  Did she say to him on Sunday precisely   what action?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't think it was specific   operational detail as to what was going to happen.  I think that they   had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of   action.  I think, as she noted, he asked a few general questions just   trying to get a sense of how things were considered.  But it wasn't   minute-by-minute detail of how the operation --  	       	     Q	  Well, was it, ""we are going in.""  Is it, ""we're   going to use tear gas""?  I mean, what?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe it was that we want to go   in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in   the compound, and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement   out.  	       	     Q	  George, was there ever a conscious political   decision made, or even a discussion about distancing the President   from --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, we were in   close contact with the Justice Department.  The President accepts   responsibility for this.  At the same time -- I mean, we just wanted   to be very, very clear about how this happened and be as factual as   we could be on how the decisions were made.  It is the responsibility   of those on the ground to make recommendations.  The Attorney General   has operational control over this.  The President obviously accepts   responsibility for all of this, and he stands by the Attorney   General.  	       	     Q	  George, there was a report on the television today   -- and I don't know more than that -- one of the members of the cult   had said going into a courthouse that the FBI had started the fire   and not themselves.  There was also a picture yesterday on the TV of   a smashing into the building  where the fire broke out.  And my   question is, is the White House absolutely certain that this fire was   --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  All the evidence we have is that   this fire was started by David Koresh and those inside the compound   -- every bit of evidence we have.  	       	     Q	  Did the President ask the Attorney General why do   this now, why this particular date, and did he ask about possible   consequences of either death or injury?    	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific   questions.  He had general questions about how the decision was going   about being made.  	       	     Q	  Those are general questions and did he ask   generally, why now?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he asked, have you   considered all of the consequences; have you considered the   recommendations?  I don't know if he asked the question, ""why now?  ""    I don't know if he asked that specific question.  	       	     Q	  Did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff   that's come out since then about the information provided by the   listening device about Koresh getting increasingly more violent?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much   specific detail they got into.  I know that she generally said that   this is the recommendation she's prepared to make, I mean, the   decision she's prepared to make.  It's based on the recommendations   she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of   those involved.  Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was   beyond that.  	       	     Q	  What is the President's understanding why   yesterday?  One of the people who went into the compound a couple   weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may   have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this   action.  Why yesterday?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.  I   think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has   said.  There were indications that those inside the compound were at   some danger.  It was clear that the negotiations had broken down and   it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that   the situation was not going to get any better at all.    	       	     There was also some concern over the vulnerability of   the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that   these teams normally have to work.  And as the Attorney General has   said, there was some concern over the fact that they did not have   replacements in place who could stand in for them, and there was a   concern over the safety.    	       	     All of these factors came into play.  They also   considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts   on David Koresh and those in the compound.  I would just go back to   what the Attorney General has said.  You have to make the best   judgment you can, given the information you have at the time.  They   did.  Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.  It's a terribly   unfortunate situation.  We all wish it could have turned out   differently, but that doesn't take away from the judgments that were   made at the time.  	       	     Q	  George, when did the President know that they were   going to use tear gas?  Was it before the assault on the compound?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.  I don't believe   he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.    I just don't know.  	       	     Q	  Along that point, George, can you say whether the   plan was presented to the President by the Attorney General as a way   to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday?  	         	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was presented as a way   to increase the pressure on those in the compound and, we all hoped,   as a way to move some of those out and bring it in -- it wasn't   presented as tomorrow is D-Day, this is it.  	       	     Q	  Is the President satisfied that, A, he had all this   relevant information necessary to make a decision, and B, that Janet   Reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I think he's satisfied that   they were acting on the best advice and the best information they   had, and he's not second-guessing it in any way whatsoever.  	       	     Q	  George, was there a 12-hour gap between   conversations between the President and the Attorney General?  In   other words, they spoke at 11:00 a.m. and they didn't speak again   until Clinton got back from dinner at --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's likely, yes.  	       	     Q	  Did he call her?  What time did she call?  Was   there a gap between when she called him?  I mean, was he at dinner   when she called and --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.  I think he called her   last night.  I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last   night.  He just wanted to talk to her.  	       	     Q	     what was going on?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.  	       	     Q	  What do you know about the situation now?  Everyone   has perished who -- except eight or nine?  And do you know any of the   other details?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than   the FBI reported in Waco.  	       	     Q	     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what   is going on?  If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was   he keeping track of what was going on here?  I mean, with all due   respect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  There was also -- as I said,   several people in the White House were in constant contact with their   counterparts at Justice to have the full and complete information.  	       	     Q	  Who were those contacts?  I mean, was it Mack   McLarty, Webb Hubbell?  How was the President being kept informed?    That's not a --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with   Webb.  I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.  I   believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.    Either Bernie or Vince was also in contact at different times during   the day with people at the Justice Department.  We were fully briefed   and fully informed.  	       	     Q	  We were told this morning that the President may   have spoken -- a chance that he may have spoken with Webb.  Do you   know if that's true or not?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may   have.  I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance   that he may have at some point.  I don't believe he did.  I think   that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with     the Justice Department was the 11:00 a.m. phone call with the   Attorney General.  But the White House was fully informed on a   minute-to-minute basis of what was happening in Waco and what was   happening at the Justice Department.  	       	     Q	  George, who decided that the briefing would be done   by the Attorney General?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.  	       	     Q	  Did you or did the White House communications staff   -- were you ever involved with that decision?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  We were told about it.  	       	     Q	  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-  Lehrer and all that stuff?  Was that part of --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  	       	     Q	     there was no advice from the White House at all   about her -- she was on all night, all day.  (Laughter.)  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job.   	       	     Q	  Why did you decide to have the President's reaction   to the situation be only a written statement, which is traditionally   the White House's way of distancing the President from the issue, not   having him appear as personally saying anything?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at   all.  As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of   the information at hand.  The President is also making a statement   today.  The President made a statement yesterday morning.  The   President has been fully involved --  	       	     Q	  After this turned into less than a successful   operation, the only statement from the President was what was on   paper after the Attorney General had already given what amounted to   the major facts in this.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was the first statement   from the President, not the only statement from the President, number   one.    	       	     Q	  After the --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.    Number two, the Attorney General --  	       	     Q	  He gave a statement early in the morning when the   thing was starting to move --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  And he gave one yesterday   and he's giving one today.  Now, the second point --  	       	     Q	  It just happens this was a written statement with   no sort of communications policy or thought process involved?  It was   the President wants to put out a written statement?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Knowing what we knew at the time,   we thought it was appropriate for the President and he thought it was   appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and   expressing his support for the Attorney General's --  	       	     Q	  Why was it not appropriate for him to personally do   something?    	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.    That is his statement.  It's a statement under his name.  	       	     Q	  George, yesterday during the briefing you didn't   say the President took full responsibility for what happened --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I certainly did.  	       	     Q	  No, what you said was --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.  	       	     Q	  Well, I think you can go back to the transcript, I   mean, unless I miss something --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'd love to.  	       	     Q	     Janet Reno said that she took full   responsibility and you said that she made the decision, that the FBI   --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  And the President takes   responsibility.  Absolutely.  	       	     Q	  Took responsibility -- all right.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.  	       	     Q	  Considering how little was known about what was   going on inside the compound and, even now, how little is known, why   is Washington calling this a mass suicide?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that knowing what we   know now and given all of the actions of David Koresh before and   during, it is painfully clear that those there were under his   control.  	       	     Q	  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are   concerned, though, isn't it, George?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely   different matter.  I mean, I think that David Koresh must bear   responsibility for the deaths of those children, absolutely.  But he   clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident,   and that's what he did.  	       	     Q	  You're still operating completely on assumption,   right?  I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that   this was mass suicide.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We have evidence that those inside   the compound set fire to the compound, which led to the deaths of   those inside.  	       	     Q	  I didn't quite hear it.  This might be Ann's   question, I didn't quite hear it.  But at what time did Clinton   himself put out a statement on this?  I know Dee Dee said some stuff   on this at 6:00 p.m., but the President put out --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  At 6:35 p.m., 6:40 p.m.  	       	     Q	  Right after the evening news went on the air?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the   information.  We were working on it.  	         	     Q 	  Dee Dee confirmed this morning that the   investigation the President is going to announce is going to be an   administration-run investigation.  Why not have someone from the   outside to make sure that it's not colored by those who would have a   political stake, particularly those at the ATF whose actions have   already been --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that clearly the ATF and   the Justice Department will bear responsibility for the   investigation.  That's not to rule out, as is often in investigations   like this, having some sort of independent involvement as well.  But   it will be run by the Treasury and Justice.   	       	     Q	  Are you confident that you will not have any   problem getting --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  	       	     Q	  George, did the President reach out to anybody else   to get advice after the meeting with Janet Reno?  And who else in the   White House sat in on that meeting?  Anyone else from Justice?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was   there at the time.  It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a   meeting.  	       	     Q	  Sunday.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.  It was a phone call, it   wasn't a meeting.  I believe he might have been there with Bruce, but   beyond that, I think he just talked to the Attorney General.  	       	     Q	  George, you said that in that phone call, she said   that we want to go in and take action, as you said, that will force   him out.  What did he think she was talking about?  If he didn't know   about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he was approving an action   to increase the pressure on --  	       	     qQ	   It didn't matter how she did that?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  I mean --  	       	     Q	  What information did he have in terms of how this   would proceed?  Presumably he would have wanted to know, not minute-  by-minute, but in a general sense --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he knew that this was the   recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the   law enforcement agencies.  I just don't know --  	       	     Q	  What is ""this"" -- when you say that ""this"" was the   recommendation --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The action to increase pressure.  I   don't know exactly what he was told -- whether he was going to be   told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a   hole in the window, or whether he was just told generally that they   were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure.  I   just don't know.  	       	     Q	  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.  	       	     Q	     that Janet Reno presented him with as her best   advice about what they should go forward with, he would have agreed?  	         	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He was -- he did ask some general   questions about the advice and recommendation he gave.  At the same   time -- and I would repeat -- that this was based on the unanimous   recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.  	       	     Q	  George, it would seem that this question about just   exactly in what detail the President was informed about the nature of   the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere.  Can you   take that question and --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.  Yes.  	       	     Q	     get the answer and come back to us with all of   it?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  	       	     Q	  Can you tell us that there was never a meeting -- a   strategy session -- where you and others decided, we will put out a   written statement from the President and we will have Janet Reno be   on all of these television broadcasts?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.  Never.  	       	     Q	  And you never called the Justice Department and   said to anyone or Janet Reno, ""you're the one who needs to be out   front explaining this""?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.  	       	     Q	  It just happened that way that she was the   spokesman, that no one ever saw Bill Sessions until --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  She made a decision as Attorney   General that it was important for her as the operational officer in   charge, as the person who made the decision, to go out and take the   questions on this tragic incident.  	       	     Q	  She had no guidance from the White House at all?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.  	       	     Q	  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you   didn't object, but did you suggest it?  Was this a plan --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No. Absolutely not.  	       	     Q	     a strategy?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  	       	     Q	  Did she clear it?    	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  	       	     Q	  Did she notify you?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.  	       	     Q	  What happened to this great detailed process you   have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and   every -- under every rock and every place in government that   something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion   between you and the public information people at least at the Justice   Department?  	         	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General made the   decision and the Attorney General wanted to go forward.  It seemed   like a good decision.  It was a good decision.  She did a good job.  	       	     Q	  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how   you would handle it?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.  	       	     Q	  You wouldn't change a thing if --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?  	       	     Q	  The way the White House handled any part of it --   from start to finish.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I think that's an awful broad   question and we're certainly going to have a review.  One of the   reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that   something like this -- see what we can learn from an incident like   this and see what we can learn about how to handle them.  If you're   talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences, no,   there -- wouldn't make any change at all.  	       	     Q	  Two questions:  First of all, on her going on TV,   no White House people or outside media consultants came up with this   idea?  It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the   campaign.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?  	       	     Q	  I'm thinking of like watching Clinton on Nightline   after the draft story; watching Clinton on --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  There's absolutely no comparison.    Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident.  The incident ended   in tragic deaths of many, many people.  The Attorney General was   involved in that decision.  The Attorney General made the decision to   do that.  She felt it was her responsibility in the interest of   public information to go out and take the questions of the press in   order to make sure that all of the questions were answered, and she   did a fantastic job.  	       	     Q	  The second question is, did -- as someone who knows   Clinton as well as you do, can you understand why it's sort of hard   to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about   what she intended to do?  In other words, she came and she said, I'm   going to put pressure on them.  It's hard not to see Clinton, who's   fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.  	       	     Q	  What kind?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Both the Attorney General said that   he did ask questions, he did ask general questions.  I don't have a   minute-by-minute account of the conversation.  	       	     Q	  How long a conversation?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.  	       	     Q	  Telephone conversation?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  	       	     Q	  George, was the federal cost of this standoff ever   a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure --  	         	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe so, no.  	       	     Q	  George, you keep saying that the President takes   full responsibility, but then you refer to it as her decision.  Does   the President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is   ultimately his decision?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do   with Commander-In-Chief.  This was a law enforcement action, not a   military action.  And he clearly takes responsibility for the   decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his   government.  I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.  	       	     Q	  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as   hers, or is he saying it's her decision?  There's a difference.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her   decision.  He did not object to that decision.  He clearly takes full   responsibility.   	       	     Q	  George, this briefing has gone on just a little   over 15 minutes, and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.    What exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just   very general?  That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone   conversation.  It was a very important phone conversation.  I think   Brit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.  	       	     Q	  One of the things Reno said last night is that the   buck stops here.  I think that was her direct quotation.  Does the   President agree with that in this case?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full   responsibility.  I think what the Attorney General was saying is that   she made a decision, that she's going to accept all the   responsibility that comes to her.  And she's not shrinking from that   at all, but neither is the President.   	       	     Q	  At any point in the conversation last night between   the President and the Attorney General or this morning, did she ever   offer her a resignation?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge.   	       	     Q	  Even before the fire was out yesterday, there were   some Republicans on Capitol Hill calling for an investigation.  Is   the White House at all concerned about the timing of those requests   trying to make political hay out of this situation?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And I don't want to cast any   questions about the motives of those who are requesting   investigation.  We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and   complete investigation.  	       	     Q	  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?    Will you put out a written statement?  Will you -- the wires?  How   will you answer the question that you've taken?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.  	       	     Q	  George, can you remind us what the President was   doing all yesterday afternoon, where he was, and what meetings he was   involved in?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.  He   had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during     the afternoon.  He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and   getting periodic reports on that as well.  He did see some on CNN as   well.  I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as   well.  	       	     Q	  And those reports would have come to him from Mack   McLarty, would they -- do you think?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to   him, I talked to him.  	       	     Q	  George, to follow Helen's question, in their   conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last   night in response to the question about whether she would resign?    Did he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?  I'm here   to reassure you that you don't have to do this?  Did that come up at   all?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up   that specifically.  I know that the bulk of the conversation was   discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation   --  	       	     Q	   The didn't talk at all about her kind of   remarkable comment last night about --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I believe she was asked a   question.  	       	     Q	  And her response was, if the President wants me to,   I will.  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Which would be, I think, the   standard response that most Cabinet members would give.  I mean, it's   a conditional statement.  	       	     Q	     have a need to talk about whether -- personally   about whether the President wanted her --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if they talked about   it.  I mean, what I learned about the conversation was that it was   largely about the investigation itself.  And this just didn't come   up.  I did not ask the question if they talked about --  	       	     Q	  Will you take that with the Brit package?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.  (Laughter.)  	       	     Q	  George, for the record, does the President want her   to resign?  I know Dee Dee answered this morning --  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.  He supports Janet   Reno.  She's a good Attorney General.  She's done a good job.  She   handled a difficult situation extremely well.  	       	     Q	  George, does the President feel that he and Janet   Reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law   enforcement experts on the ground?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  And the President is not   second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.    That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.    Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.  But the best   judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best   information we had.  	         	     Q	  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on   Sunday, is that correct?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.  	       	     Q	  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday   morning?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.  I'll take that   question, too.  	       	     Q	  Were these outside experts that they were   consulting with, or experts within the ATF and the FBI?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.  I'm just   not sure.  I know that there were several experts.  	       	     Q	  And also, why weren't there replacements for these   people?  Is the unit that small?    	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small   highly-specialized unit.  But I think it's one of the kinds of things   that the investigation will examine.  	       	     Q	  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI   Director?  Normally, a president, when he wants to get information,   doesn't only asks the Attorney General.  I know the chain of command.    But presidents talk to their FBI directors.  In this case, throughout   this entire siege, he has not felt that he could pick up the phone   and talk to Bill Sessions, who is from Waco, and get expertise from   him on what to do and what not to do?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he talked to the FBI   Director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke   out in Waco.  At the same time, the Attorney General bears the   ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the   Attorney General.  	       	     Q	  Don't you think the ambiguous situation that   Director Sessions is in has some impact on the way the President is   briefed and on the way that all of this evolved?  	       	     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not at all.  I mean, it's perfectly   appropriate that he be briefed by the Attorney General and that the   Attorney General has supervisory authority over the FBI Director, and   that's following the chain of command.  	       	     THE PRESS:  Thank you .                                     END                    1:03 P.M. EDT  	       #60-04/20  	        "

Short notes.    /* Written  4:43 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */  /* ---------- ""From Israeli press. Short notes."" ---------- */  FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS    Hadashot, 14 March 1993:    The Israeli Police Department announced on the evening of Friday,  March 12 that it is calling upon [Jewish] Israeli citizens with  gun permits to carry them at all times ""so as to contribute to  their security and that of their surroundings"".    Ha'aretz, 15 March 1993:    Yehoshua Matza (Likud), Chair of the Knesset Interior Committee,  stated that he intends to demand that the police department make  it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills  [non-Jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.    Ha'aretz, 16 March1993:    Today a private security firm and units from the IDF Southern  Command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the Gaza  strip, as an additional stage in the upgrading of security  measures in the Strip.    The gates will aid in the searching of [non-Jewish] Gaza residents  as they leave for work in Israel. They can be used to reveal the  presence of knives, axes, weapons and other sharp objects.    In addition to the gates, which will be operated by a private  civilian company, large quantities of magnetic-card reading  devices are being brought to the inspection points, to facilitate  the reading of the magnetic cards these [non-Jewish] workers must  carry.

However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,  the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are  predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class.  The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,  while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three  times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver.  The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not  one of gun control.    >The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable""  >homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during  >the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only  >21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred...    That is a gross distortion: ""Self-defense"" does not mean killing  the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their   attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that  0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every  case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence  where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.  (0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,  based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000  crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other   studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.  Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences  involve killing the attacker.)     So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000)   cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted  in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in  comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides  make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study  considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides  prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be  close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.

The trap is the easy way out.  	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the  demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,  and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're  going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic  group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors  leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than  not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few  Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime  statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then  worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable  or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to  define ""us"" and ""other"" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous  when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational  humans.  	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the  *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial  makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in  San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its ""ethnic diversity"". Here, we  have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the ""model minority"") gangs,  and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly  troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their  propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on  the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and  crime are what they most fear. During the ""disturbance"" in Los Angeles last  year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I  remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs  where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned  from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives  that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly  multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that  in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*  riot!  	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points  that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the  racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As  a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem  becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly  believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current  course of denial and repression.  	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,  luck in avoiding the ""trap"".

If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the  	warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they  	wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,  	Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been  	able to have told such heroic stories about how they  	""protected"" the rest of us from a group of people who  	kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.    The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored  transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use  more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to  do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they  must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.    	The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  	of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.    With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed  more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is  the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.    	Well, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by  	everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll  	just let it pass for now.    	Case Western reserve, huh?

Just so they get the address right, that is...    Look  at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country  of ours.    	Well, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.    	I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was  	in Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect  	the right of the government to attack its own citizens with  	military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant  	is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault  	on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in  	Iraq, or Syria...)    With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with  mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few  women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn  to death 51 days later.    	This is a joke, right?

The suffering that they are    Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag'   and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians   committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of   despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned   them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound   hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated   personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most   unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                     AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the  Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in  his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of  Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.    ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,""  the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the  Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to  be alive.""    Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity  for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12  days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the  2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the  edge of Karabakh.    ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard  before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy  machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.    Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction  of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started  fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the  snow into a forest on the other side.    To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam  about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,  until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two  Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.    ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by  a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening  fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.    Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward  to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts  were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his  group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman  son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his  67-year-old elder brother.    ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,""  he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We  have never got any of the bodies back.""    The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.  One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he  struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's  crossing, Mr Sadikov said.    Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and  several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy  hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three  Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.    As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was  little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was  soon to flee.    ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian  rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I  had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.  They even found a bullet in my sock.""    Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the  Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Can it be that  criminal/Nazi Armenians of ASALA/SDPA/ARF hate Muslims for ideological   reasons regardless of what they do? Between 1914 and 1920, your criminal  Armenian grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all   conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol   over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their   parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers   and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And   today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other   nation had ever known in history.                                     Source: The Times, 2 March 1992    CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH    ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES   TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...    As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw   the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as   they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to   journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts   of the hills.    The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING   of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians   last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death   or missing...     Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter   as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there   was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer   ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We   swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon   under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.    We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round   again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a   valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung   round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired   repeated blasts.    Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting   had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed   enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in   fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.   I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,   its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on   ""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a   search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.    Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two   M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed   flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second   crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains   and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters   were there to give covering fire if necessary.    The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet   armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani   official told us that there were now five former Soviet military   helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have   signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged   in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian   pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.    We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an   heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer   white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four   corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an   Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies   on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back   towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before   the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.    Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the   civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were   covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor   mortis. They had been shot.    What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,   and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY   DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

2,"  You can get a *little* UV by putting a heavy UV filter (deep purple) in  front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).  My father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.    Good UV (""blacklight"") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  I'd proceed by  getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an  electrical supply house and finding a UV bulb that would fit it.    --   :-  Michael A.

2,"  I know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or   even gets better because of his/her belief in the medicine and   the doctor administering it.  Is there also an anti-placebo   effect where the patient dislikes/distrusts doctors and medicine   and therefore doesn't get better or feel better in spite of the   medicine?    Is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a   medicine that he/she sees improvement where the is none or sees   more improvement than there is?  If so, what is this effect   called?  Is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor   doesn't believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than   there is?  What would this effect be called?  Have these effects   ever been studied?  How common are these effects?  Thank you in   advance for all replies.     ...

2,"      I would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is  output from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of  100 or 1000 ---- so that the resulting voltage can be fed  more easily into a personal-computer-based ADC data  acquisition card.    Might anyone be able to point me to references to such  circuits?  I have seen simple amplifier circuits before, but  I am not sure how well they work in practice.    In this case, I'd like something which will amplify sufficiently  ""nicely"" to be used for thermocouples (say, a few degrees  accuracy or better).    Any pointers would be greatly appreciated! "

The classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from  Friedman:    	""No new cypher is worth considering unless it comes   	from someone who has already broken a very hard one.""    Historically, Friedman has been right.  It's really hard to develop  a good cypher.  IBM's Lucifer, the precursor to DES, turns out to have  been fatally flawed.  Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem  to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  The first two tries at  public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  Most  if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were  broken eventually.  Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption  have been disappointing; the classic ""A survey of data insecurity packages""  in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the  popular ""security packages"" of the late 1980s.            A new, proprietary algorithm?  No way.            If the US is permitting general export of this thing, it has  to be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  Currently there's  a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be  no problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms  (I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.  I can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the   PTO and the State Department's Arms Control Division without finding that out.    					John Nagle    p.s.

2,"    I had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,  to put both machines on one line.  You order distinctive  ringing from your phone company.  This is $3/month here.  You get a second (unpublished) phone number.  When  someone calls this number, your phone rings with short  rings instead of long rings.    You set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax  on six rings.  You'd give out the new # as your fax #.  A device would measure the length of rings.  When it  detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.  Five rings later your fax picks up the call.    This should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80  switches now available.    But that's not what I did.  I'm giving out the new  # to my friends and customers.  This should leave the  old # for telemarketers, etc.  I won't pick up the  phone when I hear the long rings.  --   ""Why my thoughts are my own, when they are in, but when they are out  they are another's."" - Susannah Martin, hanged for witchcraft, 1692.

2,"Sender: news@osuunx.ucc.okstate.edu (USENET News System)  Nntp-Posting-Host: vms.ocom.okstate.edu  Organization: OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine  Date: Fri, 23 Apr 1993 18:15:54 GMT    I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(  toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well   because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got   into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium   would prevent kidney stone formation.  I'm going to state it again here.  But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6   supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).    Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams   per day).    	1. Review Article ""Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney   	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C"" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.  	   5(3):110-129(1985).    But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both   glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this   production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,   but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.    	2. ""Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in   	    patients with kidney stones"" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)  	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary   	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.    	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria"" Clin. Sci. 38  	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day   	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.    For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is   required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for   oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is   quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.    The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%   of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable   and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto   6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic   acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the   extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a   very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.   Med. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day   increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg   per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was   increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose   and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion   before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average   before supplementation.    B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There   are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don't know about   yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the   speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must   have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then   explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C   challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your   intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you   take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient   in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate   kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets   absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day   showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309  -15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase   in urinary oxalate excretion.    	Here are the high oxalate foods:    	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.  	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams    	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,   	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.  	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.    If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot   of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points   out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your   intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being   absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn't   have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for   males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).  B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more   per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).      The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day   for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with   this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6   requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that   either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6   excretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,  isoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to   supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that   increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking   birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the   other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your   dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone   formation should be given B6 supplements.    One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your   Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is   calcium-oxalate.    	4. ""The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of   patients with calcium oxalate calculi""Invest. Urol 10:147(1972)    	5. ""Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the   crystallization of calcium in urine: changes producted by food-magnesium   interaction""J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).    	6.Review Article, ""Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment   of renal calcium stones"" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).    There are actually about three times as many articles published in the   medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone   formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in   stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier   post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I   guess that he doesn't read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney   stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought   I'd tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor's office.

If the Clipper chip can do cheap crypto for the masses, obviously one  could do the same thing WITHOUT building in back doors.    Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good  system right now. A standard codec chip, a chip to do vocoding, a DES  chip, a V32bis integrated modem module, and a small processor to do  glue work, are all you need to have a secure phone. You can dump one  or more of the above if you have a fast processor. With integration,  you could put all of them onto a single chip -- and in the future they  can be.    Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government.  You can do everything the clipper chip can do without needing it to be  compromised. When the White House releases stuff saying ""this is good  because it gives people privacy"", note that we didn't need them to  give us privacy, the capability is available using commercial hardware  right now.    Indeed, were it not for the government doing everything possible to  stop them, Qualcomm would have designed strong encryption right in to  the CDMA cellular phone system they are pioneering. Were it not for  the NSA and company, cheap encryption systems would be everywhere. As  it is, they try every trick in the book to stop it. Had it not been  for them, I'm sure cheap secure phones would be out right now.    They aren't the ones making cheap crypto available. They are the ones  keeping cheap crypto out of people's hands. When they hand you a  clipper chip, what you are getting is a mess of pottage -- your prize  for having traded in your birthright.    And what did we buy with our birthright? Did we get safety from  foreigners? No. They can read conference papers as well as anyone else  and are using strong cryptography. Did we get safety from professional  terrorists? I suspect that they can get cryptosystems themselves on  the open market that work just fine -- most of them can't be idiots  like the guys that bombed the trade center. Are we getting cheaper  crypto for ourselves? No, because the market would have provided that  on its own had they not deliberately sabotaged it.    Someone please tell me what exactly we get in our social contract in  exchange for giving up our right to strong cryptography?  --  Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com  --  Laissez faire, laissez passer.

0,"  The stragegy of the government is interesting.  The real fear comes from  them doing more than this.    This is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on  the surface.    Their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  They are  pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they  get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market.  It will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have  registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for  most phone companies.    You see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any  cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow  the standard.  AT&T has already announced a clipper chip encryption  product.  The government has marketed hard to get major vendors to  use these chips.   If they get enough market share, they will rule.    And thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be  tapped by the police.  The public isn't that concerned about it now,  after all.  They freely do calls that anybody with an old TV can listen  to today!  They won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure  them only from the police.    Well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with  other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones  expensive.  Unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them  cheap, only the Mob will buy them.    And this means that the FBI will want to track the customer lists of  better encryption phones, because ""the only reason a person would want  one is to evade the police.""

I can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant  effect on the overall sky brightness.  Venus is visible during the day,  but nobody complains about that.

Non-toxic tear gas?!?  Do you know what tear gas is?           I do: once upon a time I happened to be in a room when someone threw          a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  The sensation          was incredible: I felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.         I remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out         like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping         out of the windows (thank G-d we were on the first floor).           I can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.    For them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much  as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully  understanding the cause.  Many years ago, I was accidentally exposed  to a tiny dose of tear gas.  (It was in Athens, on the street leading  to the American Embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up  with tear-gas; I must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the  next day.)  Aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,  the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling  to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---I was horrified and  wondered what disease or other health problem I had.  (I didn't find  out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  I can imagine  how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:  suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of  control of your body---and not knowing the cause.    ``This gives us a chance to try the Gas of Peace.''  Yeah, right.    --  -30-  Bob Ingria   "

Okay, now here's my interpretation of _Boomer_, based on the facts as  presented in the New York Court of Appeals<*> holding (_Boomer v.    <*>Note: The New York Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York     State.  While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their     highest court ""Supreme Court,"" ""Supreme Judicial Court"" or ""Supreme     Court of Appeals,"" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the     ""Court of Appeals.""  To make matters worse, New York also calls its     _second-highest_ court the ""Supreme Court, Appellate Division""...    Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):    Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's  plant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to  which came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he  defendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course  of its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the  plaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the  plant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked  the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.    (Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned  their property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.  Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)    Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court  ordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided  that Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In  other words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the  power and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment  of their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is  always problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a  private firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.    (Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if  it walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks  like eminent domain...)    Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that  ""What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the  plaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million  dollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.""  Blackmail?        (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....      ""Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to      do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose      disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under      extortion statutes."")    How do you define as ""blackmail"" one party's act of demanding the right  to set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns  and which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of  demanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see  it, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of  owning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to  stay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price  they wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says  that you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.    You go on to say: ""The plant would never have been shut down -- the  plaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,  because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to  having the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less  than the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.""    If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the  business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from  other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those  other parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice  between paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,  shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_  business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_  the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was  Atlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type  of plant they did where and when they did.)    And then you say: ""Everyone's property rights were protected; the  plaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.""  As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were ""made whole.""  They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners  of property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price  acceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made  whole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the  business of ensuring that ""unnecessary"" settlement costs are avoided?  (If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were  supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)    > Is _Boomer_ really being taught as ""infamous?""  That's really sad if  > it is, because I fail to see how it's less than completely sensible.  > You should read the law and economics stuff first-hand instead of  > filtered through teachers who clearly don't like it, for whatever  > inexplicable reasons.    (1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as ""infamous,"" at least not at my  school.    (Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for  their first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first  encountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal  opinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get  into their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick  and choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional  Responsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly  and self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously  intimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly  biased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors  tend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is  especially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are  practicing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_  educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat  cloistered scholar.  End of aside.)    I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons  I've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can  only call ""economic correctness"" over justice.    (2) It is ""completely sensible"" only if you believe that the alleged  right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid  losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and  the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to  not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who  own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.  (And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other  branch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take  other people's property by eminent domain.)    > You'd like Posner, Bill.  He's a libertarian.    Really?

I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to  as ""law and economics"" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical  analysis as one of many ""tie-breaker"" factors which courts may use to  help them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by  the scale of ""justice"", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by  _Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics  of a case as being more important than the justice of a case.    -- William December Starr <wdstarr@athena.mit.edu>   "

This happened to   me, and it took six months to sort the mess out.

Born 1959     Teacher     Sumgait Secondary School No. 10     Secretary of the Komsomol Organization at School No. 10     Member of the Sumgait City Komsomol Committee Office       Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15     Microdistrict No. 3     Sumgait [Azerbaijan]    [Note: The events in Kafan, used as a pretext to attack Armenians in    Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights   organizations - DD]    I'm thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in  Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the  price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide  our lives into ""before"" and ''after."" We talk like that: that was before the  war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole  epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,  it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even   sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now  . . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those  inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our  losses and everything that happened.    Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it  to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would  be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and   those who didn't.    That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you   could already smell danger in the air. But we didn't think that the danger was  near and possible, so we didn't take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as  my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children.   My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought  that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.    In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the  afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all  our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin  crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel  like it's all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our   apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in   his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely   locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We're known as a   hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people   who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends  of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.    My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my   mother, ""Run to the kitchen for a knife."" But Mother was detached, pale, as   though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never   expected it of her, she's afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A   girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said,   ""No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you're not to come out   of the bedroom. We're going to tell them that we're alone in the apartment.""    We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl   crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and  Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that   perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside   me. I'm an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to  embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina   was thinking the same thing, but she's quite reserved. We didn't have time to   say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout.   There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from  excited voices. I couldn't figure what was going on out there because the door  to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time  Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,  but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us   immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at   least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their   eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst  in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn't see. They   came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other   room. He didn't utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma   snatched the axe from behind and said, ""Tell them not to touch the children.   Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children."" She  said this to Father in Armenian.    There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They   understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don't know Armenian,   they don't need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: ""You and   your children both . . . we're going to do the same thing to you and your   children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls,   our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,"" and   so on and so forth, ""and we came to do the same thing to you."" This whole time  some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They   were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren't any older people   among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town,   all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I'm   a teacher.    So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took   him in there, no they didn't take him in there, they dragged him in there,  because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all   but a crack. We couldn't see what was happening to Father, what they were   doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off   Mamma's sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: ""I'm old enough to   be your mother! What are you doing?!"" He struck her. Now he's being held,   Mamma identified him. I hope he's convicted. Then they went after Karina,   who's been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying   to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their   consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they   mustn't do it. She said, ""Come on, let's straighten this out, without   emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we   ever do to you?"" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come   into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and   coming--said, ""What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We   came here to kill them.""    They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she   didn't cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, ""What  did we do to you? What did we do to you?"" And even later, when she came to,   she said, ""Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?""    That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only   broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they   were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain   nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do   was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they  did to her. That's why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off,   they beat her savagely . . . It's really amazing that she not only lived, but   didn't lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they   could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists,   kicking her, using anything they could find.    Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn't feel any pain,   just didn't feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they   did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn't enough room in the  apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the   corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, ""Let's take her   outside.""    Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they   weren't afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time   I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren't   afraid of what would happen to them.    When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered   with blood--that's when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several   times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though   I were recording it all on film. I think I'm a kind person by nature, but I'm   vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don't deserve it. I hold   a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time   I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I'd remember them,   and I'll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me   ""forget,"" you have to forget, you have to go on living.    At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and   despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found  the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had  to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering   to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that  he's being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me  and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over  me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that  they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up  with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a   really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I   suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly   I felt myself flying. I couldn't figure out if I was really flying or if I   just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I'm going to smash on the   ground. And when it didn't happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was   still lying on the floor. And since I didn't scream, didn't beg them at all,  they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with  their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-  cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.    I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it.   Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn't   need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had   even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn't worth   living.    There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman   pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come   because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself,   and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to  put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The   person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well,   because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he   has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person,   one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see,   even during the investigation he almost called me ""daughter,"" he apologized,   although, of course, he knew that I'd never forgive him. Something like that   I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my   words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person's shoes,  but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never   forget it.    I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one   could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of   beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn't be able to do anything.  I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.    And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a  couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn't, so he tried to   kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an   end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into   the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don't know which one it   was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was   thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her   and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all   the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor   from the Melkumians' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a   little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,  how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He's a good person. He said,   ""You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,  I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,"" he  says, ""nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and   think I never shall again."" The door to his apartment was open and he saw   everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken   the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He   saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven  people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the   brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that   they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to   do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I    After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and   Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn't even   remember my sister's name. I wanted to cry ""Marina!"" out to her, but could  not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn't  for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus  I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had  told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both  there by chance, that they weren't Armenians. Lyuda's a Russian, you can tell   right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that  she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I'm glad   that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . .   although her spirit was murdered . . .    At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that   mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his   name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, ""Igor,  help!"" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were   taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and   Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the   neighbors.    And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment,   something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.     Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one,   they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out   onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already   sure that I was dead because I didn't react at all to the new blows. Someone   said, ""She's already dead, let's throw her out."" When they carried me out onto  the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I   heard someone say in Azerbaijani: ""Don't kill her, I know her, she's a   teacher."" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can't remember  whose voice it was. It wasn't Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an   accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks  Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and  threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	I having opened my   eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had   been beaten so much that I didn't have the strength to remember him. I only   remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately   I can't remember anything more.    What should I say about Igor? He didn't treat me badly. I had heard a lot   about him, that he wasn't that good a person, that he sometimes drank too  much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that   women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,  if he was wounded, then it's about eighty percent sure that he will be treated  very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in   Ufa, and was injured, but that's not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that   all out later.    Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary   of the Party organization. I don't know his last name, his first name is   Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn't so sure,  she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she   didn't want to endanger him. She said, ""He was there,"" and a little while   later, ""Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else.   No, it seems like it was he."" I am sure it was he because when he came to see   us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something   entirely different. The investigators haven't summoned him yet. He came to see  us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought   groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started   crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don't know if he was putting   us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned   him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn't in Sumgait.   The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is   right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don't know how the   investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was  told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn't he have gone   to Baku and arranged an alibi? I'm not ruling out that possibility.    Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she   bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her   wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband's   lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A   Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He's an orphan who was raised by  his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a   special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I'll say this--I'm   a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that  boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He's healthy, he can think just fine,   and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he's cunning, too.   After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.    He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, ""Lady, if you give us all the gold   and money in your apartment we'll let you live."" And Mamma told them where   the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and   everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other   over and taking the gold from one another. I'm surprised they didn't kill one   another right then.    Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was  black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she   ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his  mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-  low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn't walk; like me, he was half dead,   halfway into the other world. He couldn't comprehend anything, couldn't see,   and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth,   it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.    The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father   out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,  a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people   were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants,   everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee  service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, ""I was afraid   to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the   threshold I couldn't hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and   dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors'."" Mamma remembered one of the   criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her,   out of one eye. She says, ""I realized that my death would come from that   person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.""  Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.    I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina   was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all  alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even  though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and  Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.  I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another.   But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones   I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the   ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and   that all of that would die with me.    At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I   didn't know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that  we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, ""Neighbor, is that  you?"" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived  I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been   taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to   take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he  had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he   started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room.   The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in   the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the   presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities   or not. He said, ""Enough, let's go to the third entryway."" In the third   entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once   again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as   they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they   found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had   already taken the other.    Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They  had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over  those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I   identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an   Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:  ""Sister, don't be afraid, I'll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.""  That's just what he said, ""those Azerbaijanis,"" as though he himself were not   Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, ""I'll drive  them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails  and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.""   That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the   person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened   to, the ""general,"" said that they were going to the third entryway.    Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn't do it by myself.   Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I  was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer.   He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut.   But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.    I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt   from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find   anything. He told me, ""Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the   neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're   alive."" He told me all this in Armenian.    Then he returned to the others and said, ""What are you waiting for? Leave!""   They said, ""Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her   yourself. No, we want to do it to."" He urged them on, but gently, not   coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just  boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went  down to the third floor with them himself, and said, ""Leave. What's the mat-  ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?"" And  he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that   he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I   told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really  good terms with them.    We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman   opened the door and immediately said, ""I'm an Azerbaijani."" He said, ""I know.   Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows  about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place."" She says, ""Fine,  have her come in."" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I   had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into   tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a   half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, ""Do you know where my family   is, what happened to them?"" She says, ""No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid   to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see   who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian."" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my   neighbor says, ""You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you,   or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else."" During the butchery in our  apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl  earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was   still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I   touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it  to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.    I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I   don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I   end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the   apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor.   I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had   hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near   some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing.   Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I   think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were  broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay   there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town   could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were   burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started  picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport   jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the  one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out.   And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to   strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on   my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me  afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got   burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was  protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know   how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if   I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I   had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on   living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I   thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her.   I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in   Afghanistan, he should protect her.    While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I  thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would   she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among   themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no  children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter.   Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good   job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was   all over. They started to argue. A third one says, ""How come you get it? I   have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need.   All these years I've been living in God-awful places."" Another one says,   ""Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave."" Then someone said   that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their  place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and  left.    Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite   frequently, ""Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let   them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians."" Then they   said, ""Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!"" They repeated it   very often.    		     - - - reference for #008 - - -    [1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,      Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by      Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

1,"  Those of us who questioned the mass suicide line may still have   wondered, ""If it wasn't suicide, why did so few get out?""  The   answer is now available - the gas the government had been pouring  in on them is so disabling that its use in wartime is banned by the  chemical weapons treaty.    The U.S. had agreed not to use this gas against enemy soldiers in  wartime, but used it in peacetime against civilians, including   nnocent children.    For confirmation see Friday's CLINTON:AM press briefing by George  Stephanopoulous, posted in alt.news-media and other locations.

Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the  spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).    possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people  with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up  most of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things  to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not  work as well, if it worked at all.

1,"      Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rights  violations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rights  violations.    Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in Arab  States is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and can  claim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.    I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack of  peace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.  I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come to  it. Peace AND justice.     If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should present  his claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully   entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has  a merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they  wish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the  Palestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since  Israel was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations  quasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a  legitimate claim that any decent person can and should support.     Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor  are the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.  Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be  implemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians.     Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first  party has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and  the second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some  symmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realise  the necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian people  and as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their own  past towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse to  acknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removal  of most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.    When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villages  destroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock.   I hope others will be touched by this discovery and think about the  meaning of such massive destruction and destitution.    Elias Davidsson  Iceland   "

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with.   You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on  distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel   that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum   you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to   another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.    I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line,   lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan   to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is   nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in   x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship,   that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel   free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,  the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian  criminal organizations.    x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million   Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide.   You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.    During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920,   the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide,   tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against   the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and   deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.    The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance  of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

0,"      Note:     The following was released by the White House today in            conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip            encryption technology.                               FACT SHEET                      PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT    The President has approved a directive on ""Public Encryption  Management.""  The directive provides for the following:    Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption  are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.   Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of  communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.   Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to  rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.   These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the  infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the  information age.    Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also  frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated  encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When  exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence  activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has  been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct  electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law  enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time  protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As  encryption technology improves, doing so will require new,  innovative approaches.    In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has  developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through  encryption that is substantially more robust than the current  government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed  to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys  will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information  only with appropriate legal authorization.    To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect  and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted  information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:    INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS    The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,  shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which  incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed  key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law  enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from  the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to  ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow  microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications  hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the  security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do  not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the  government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that  are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-  escrow system.    KEY-ESCROW    The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate  entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits  installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key  holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent  unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only  to government agencies that have established their authority to  acquire the content of those communications that have been  encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney  General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which  an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such  communications.    PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES    The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate  U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to  facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted  with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems  that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this  process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of  a final standard within six months of this directive.     The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to  the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct  lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure  law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General  shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture  Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. "

Your assumption is that this ""low"" dollar/pound area is  sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what  do you base this?

Wow, you gotta love the speculation.           As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw  ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and  out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even  have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.             I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be  worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed  to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of  every ship which came through.           It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how  much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood  of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------  David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

Nagorno-Karabakh is in Azerbaijan not Armenia. Armenians have lived in Nagorno-  Karabakh ever since there were Armenians. Armenians used to live in the areas  between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and this area is being used to invade   Nagorno- Karabakh. Armenians are defending themselves. If Azeris are dying  because of a policy of attacking Armenians, then something is wrong with this   policy.    If I recall correctly, it was Stalin who caused all this problem with land  in the first place, not the Armenians.    henrik]  However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane  henrik]  to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one  henrik]  that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane  henrik]  (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.    HE]     Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 U.S. Cargo planes  HE]     were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities  HE]     announced that they were going to search these cargo  HE]     planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.  HE]     5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of  HE]     of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not  HE]     humanitarian aid.....    What story are you talking about? Planes from the U.S. have been sending  aid into Armenian for two years. I would not like to guess about what were in  the 3 planes in your story, I would like to find out.      HE]     Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.  HE]     Turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons  HE]     to Azerbadjan since Armenia started to attack Azerbadjan  HE]     it self, not the Karabag province. So why search a plane for weapons  HE]     since it's content is announced to be weapons?    It's too bad you would want Turkey to start a war with Armenia. "

First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection.  Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire  shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.    The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the  tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the  grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from  each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect  the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.     ------------------------------------------------------------------  Mark E.

2,"  Forgive me, but just the other day I read on some newsgroup or other a  physician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin B6.  I can't  seem to locate the article, but I recall there was mention of some safe  limits.    I looked at a ""Balanced 100"" time release formulation from Walgreen's  and noted that the 100 mg of B6 was some thousands times the RDA.  Is  this safe?!?.    Also what was the condition that B6 was theraputic for?    Mail would be just fine if you don't want to clog the net.    Thanks,  Leon Traister (lmtra@uts.amdahl.com)   "

2,"          Joint Press release ESA/UN No 18-93  Paris, 19 April 1993    UN/ESA joint training course on satellite applications  to be held in Italy, 19-30 April    The United Nations and the European Space Agency (ESA)  are jointly organising a training course on the applications of  satellite data gathered by the European Remote Sensing  Satellite (ERS-1), to be held in Frascati, Italy, from 19 to 30  April. The training course will discuss the applications of  satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy  and the environment.    The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone  African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space  Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for  coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing  satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,  selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western  and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will  attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote  sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1  data.    The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991  with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar  instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing  missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year  2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the  potential of experts using the practical applications of radar  remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy  and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications  to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-  coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.    The education and practical training programme was  developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The  facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and  information documents for the training course, will be  provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will  include high-level experts from other European and African  organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for  the training course are being provided by the United Nations        Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the  primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.    A similar training course is being planned for Latin American  experts.     "

Good point, Brett.  It might merely be proof that basic health care  markets operate differently, with certain nonmarket phenomenom that  the private sector can't handle well (like armies vs. warlords).

Good point again.  Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared  to the Canadian and German insurance funds, which have a minimal  organization to coordinate it.  If anything, bureaucracy now needs to  be built up in Canada to combat fraud, such as Americans crossing the  border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and  relatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing  them in blocks.  Our private practices are now recording insurance  account numbers, both public insurance and private insurance, which  most have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour   system.    gld  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Gary L.

2,"Nntp-Posting-Host: starfighter.den.mmc.com    Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and  relaunching it:    (Caution: speculation mode engaged)  There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.  I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in  order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed  items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not  retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would  have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this  might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due  to thermal cycle stresses...)    I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the  HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are  much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged  (I assume that they were caged for launch)?    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Michael Corvin 	      				zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com  GN&C R&D					Martin Marietta Astronautics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  ===============    My views, not Martin Marietta's   ========================  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- "

Results of GUSTO Heart Attack Study to be Released Friday   To: Assignment Desk, Medical Writer   Contact: Jim Augustine of Medical Science Communication,            703-644-6824, or Steve Hull or Tracy Furey,            800-477-9626 or April 29-30, 202-393-2000 or            202-662-7592 (J.W. Marriott)       News Advisory:       Results of the largest heart attack study ever undertaken,  the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded  Coronary Arteries trial (GUSTO), will be presented Friday, April  30, at the Clinical Research Meeting.     A press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m.     GUSTO evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatment  strategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restore  blood flow to the heart, a process called thrombolysis.  The  thrombolytic strategies compared in GUSTO use powerful drugs to break  up blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots from  recurring.  These strategies have never been compared directly in a  large-scale clinical trial until GUSTO.  The results are expected to  have an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide.     The press conference will be held at two locations: live at the  National Press Club, Main Lounge, 13th Floor, 529 14th St., N.W.,  Washington D.C., and via satellite at The Hotel Macklowe, 145 W. 44th  Street, 4th Floor, New York City, between Broadway and 6th Avenue.     GUSTO results will be presented by Eric Topol M.D., GUSTO Study  Chairman, professor and chairman of the Department of Cardiology at  The Cleveland Clinic Foundation; Robert Califf, M.D., clinical  director, GUSTO Coordinating Center and Associate Professor of  Medicine at Duke University Medical Center; and Allan Ross, M.D.,  coordinator of the GUSTO Angiographic Substudy and professor and  director of the Division of Cardiology at The George Washington  University Medical Center.      ------     Editorial Notes/Attention television: The press conference may be  viewed in its entirety via satellite starting at 12:30 p.m. (EDT)  C-band Telestar 302, Transponder 2V (dual audio 6.2, 6.8) or KUSBS6,  Transponder 8.  Following the press conference, there will be a news  package and b-roll feed.  Camera-ready illustrations also will be  available at the press conference.     Telephone hook up to the press conference is planned.  Availability is limited; please call MCS for more information.     For reporters who will be at the Sheraton Washington attending the  Clinical Research Meeting on Friday morning, minibus transportation  will be provided to the press conference.  The bus will depart at  12 p.m.; it also will be available for return to the Sheraton  after the press conference.

If not, I have another suggested reading for  you... get into the ""soc.culture.arabic"" newsgroup where the posters have been  debating the topic ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" (and may I remind you the people doing  the debating appear to be devout Muslims with some knowledge of the Qu'ran).  You will find that Jews aren't really viewed positively by the Qu'ran (to put  it lightly).  So how do you think Jews (or any other non-Islamic religion) will  be treated by an Islamic state governed by the words of the Qu'ran?  I think  the 1948-1967 ""situation"" in Jerusalem will return *at best*!  What do you  think?    >However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their  >homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political  >thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the  >Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.    All I have to say to that is, once again, see s.c.a - ""Jews in the Qu'ran"" and  think again.  ""Freedom of choice"" is *definitely* not an option in Qu'ranic  law especially for non-Muslims and ALL women!  Remember the Gulf War?  I'm sure  you saw the reports about how women had few rights in Saudi Arabia (an Islamic  state).    >  >As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.  >    Probably nothing!  Aside from how to break the news to his Palestinian brethren  that the _Covenant_ is ""null and void"" without getting assassinated himself!    >Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true  >super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the  >Jews used to establish their state : Religion.  >    In conclusion, Ahmed, you should go to the library and find the _Palestinian  National Covenant (1964)_ and read it VERY CAREFULLY.

The best info I have seen so far is the article ""Joystick Metrics:  Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port"" by  Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.  It talks  about how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) in  BASIC, and even includes code for a simple ""oscilloscope"" display.    It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to  use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical  Reference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide some  millisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which has  appeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,  etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.

Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available  via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'.    Since you've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'.  To do this simply:  1. Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM  burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into  one file yourself with suitable gaps.)  2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game  console, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.    To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address'  is simply another address line.    For a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you would  wire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.  The 3 switches  would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM.   "

So when you turn on the power, this causes the bulb to work like a neon,   heating up and shorting out, thus providing a loop to power the heaters in   the main tube. When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the   starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out   (O/C).

TORTURE.    /* Written  4:41 pm  Apr 16, 1993 by cpr@igc.apc.org in igc:mideast.forum */  /* ---------- ""From Israeli press. TORTURE."" ---------- */  FROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.    Newspaper: Ma'ariv Date: 18. December 1992 Author: Avi Raz    Subject: Torture    Title of article: Moderate physical pressure    Several times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation  room in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,  beaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a  Shabak agent 'Captain Louis', chatting on the phone with his wife.  ""At those moments"", Omar said, ""I felt that he was like a  humanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat  me and say, 'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed  yourself' and I understood that he was not really a human being"".    In late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm  prison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. ""Among the Jews,  as among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people"", he said  after his release, ""but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations  rooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that  he is a human being"". Although he left the detention installation  in Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (""I sat at home for ten days. My  hands shook from nerves""), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He  got out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned  to normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.    In contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released  seven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the  Shabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn't speak or  react. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early  August and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left  it one day later - dead. ""We have recently received an especially  large number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at  the Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators"", noted  Dr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and  Palestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)    The right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan  Saber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely  fearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated  in Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would  return him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.    (...follow description of tortures....)    Omar, a tall bearded man, was silent. ""I do not want to talk about  it"", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and  ashamed, he spoke: ""Sometimes he beats you and beats you until  you'll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of  another interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,  and the last interrogator says:"" Now you are kissing my hand, and  later if I want, you will kiss my ass.""    These things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,  located within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West  Bank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In  early March the IDF allowed representatives of B'Tselem, the  Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to  visit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation  wing. ""The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely  under Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by  it"", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho'an, the commander of the  installation, according to the internal report written by B'tselem  member, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe'er,  governing commander of the prison system in the Central Command,  was quoted in the report:  ""There is an ethical problem here - no  one can enter the interrogation wing"".

2,"  I had the good luck to obtain an EICO dynamic conductance   tube tester for a song. Unfortunately, I was a little out of  key; the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement.  Does anyone know where I can find either another meter movement  like it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics   to specify the current scale of the meter movement? I can cut  and paste a more sensitive movement in if I can find what the  full scale current was. Or... is EICO still contactable?

The number of people  showing up at the MOW hardly constitutes the entire queer populace.  I doubt  that it constitutes more than a handful of us.  I'm queer, and I won't be  there, simply because I don't have the time or the transportation.  What the  hell makes you think the participants in the MOW embody more than a minimum  number?    Face it, people, we're everywhere.  There are always more of us than you  think.  Our numbers are constantly GROWING, not diminishing...some of your  children will grow up to join us.  Hell, some of MY children may grow up to  join us.  The best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and  blind yourself to it, but to realize that you have nothing to fear.  We're  not perverts, we're not dangerous, we're just here, and we're human just  like you--er, most of you.    Idiots like Cramer and Kaldis can rant all they like.  It won't do them one  iota of good.    Drewcifer    P.S.  I still can't get over the fact that some people actually believe that  every queer in the U.S. would show up at the MOW, and that these numbers are  meaningful.  And, come to think of it, what about those of us in OTHER  countries?  Tree.    --   ----bi    Andrew D.

2,"  Write a good manual to go with the software.  The hassle of  photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing  the package for only $15.  Also, consider offering an inexpensive  but attractive perc for registered users.  For instance, a coffee  mug.  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of  dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.    You're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use  are non-licensed users.    The best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into  your price structure.  Sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad.  Retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying  customers; the software industry is the same.

Why do American authorities consider Yigal Arens to be dangerous?    I'm not aware that the US government considers me dangerous.  In any  case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  The claim against  the ADL is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that  was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their  standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  By that I refer to  things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and  license information, photographs, etc.    > 2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?    You should ask the ADL, if you want an authoritative answer.  My guess  is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in  political criticism of Israel.  I further believe that they did this as  agents of the Israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.  At least some of the information collected by the ADL was passed on to  Israeli officials.  In some cases it was used to influence, or attempt  to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  These matters  will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since California law  entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  As my  previous posting shows, California law entitles people to compensation  even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further  dissemination of certain types of private information about them.  --  Yigal Arens  USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!  arens@isi.edu "

2,"  SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this  time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:    [1] microgravity/vacuum process research  [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)  [3] spacecraft maintenence     The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to  centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet  their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users   took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to   tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization  and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these  two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement  in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial   users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the   constellation.      Firstly, different functions are broken down into different   constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:  thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,  comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task  is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,  providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.    SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments  and are also prime candidates for constellization.    [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:  COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for  short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is  inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities   on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab  to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.  We might also expand the research program to take advantage of   interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt   or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can  be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a   station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.    [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,  but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation  environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter  of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since  astronauts will have little practical use in the space program  until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using  astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,  and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation  tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity  in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the  radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,  Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support  machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR  interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,  follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,  testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions  are spent on astronauts.    [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in   Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated  robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can  practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck  solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,  inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be  spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat  companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.    By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting  rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we  have radically improved the capability of the program while  greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,  we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study  life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety   of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum  research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose  orbits.    N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration  as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.    Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously   we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used  to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and  sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can  be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology  greenhouses on Mars at low cost.      --   Nick Szabo					 szabo@techboook.com "

How much is ""through the nose""?  After all, we know quite a bit  about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed  by the price demanded by the ""bad"" part of that 90%....    The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The ""profit"" of  gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals  out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.  That analysis ignored some ""improvements"" in the criminal gun  market that could make them even cheaper.

It's true that a hydraulically  pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,  but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,  though it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional   resistance increase is practically nil.

Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the  tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the  tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case  of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather  than locomotion. I don't know much about panda ""thumbs"", so I'll ask  is it opposable?    >>Thermodynamic considerations of surface/volume relationships would  >>seem to dictate that active complex creatures  stay in a size range  >>similar to what we see about us. 6 inch tall intelligent aliens  >>seem unlikely, as do those much larger than the elephant.  >  >Why can't a lemur or a brontosaurus* be intelligent?  >  >[*Yes, I know that the brontosaurus is a mythical beast produced by  >putting the head of another dinosaur on an apatosaurus, but so far  >space aliens are also mythical.]    Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll  bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I  don't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say ""intelligent""  I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level  with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming  suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter   it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not  a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice  for a putative technological alien.    Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but  it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level  of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron  cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur  wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument  is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room  for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One  reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages   that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult  for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very  large creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.  Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out  intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.    Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the  lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly  lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature  that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time  to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.  The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production   because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat.   I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical  reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would  tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that  of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded  creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that  some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature  the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained  or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the  waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the  ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence  to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the  environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur  would be capable of that much activity.

The latter was written with      simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind      (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).        More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John      Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS      Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32      projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both      spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a      neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.        You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,      ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This      contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are      in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.        You can order these 2 ways.

Barfling brings us some curious stories that haven't been reported  outside of fertile imaginations.  This fits in well with a report in  the New York Times from April 18, 1993:    ***********************************    Scores of Girls in Egypt Faint in Classrooms  By Chris Hedges  Cairo, April 17    The khamseen, the blustery sandstorms that arrive every spring, have  brought with them not only the usual clouds of grit and dust but also  what the authorities describe as collective hysteria.    Hundreds of teen-age girls have been fainting en masse in classrooms,  breaking out in sobs and complaining of unpleasant smells and nausea.    [...]    ""There is no clinical reason for it,"" said Dr. Ahmed Rashed at Agouza  Hospital, where dozens of girls have been tested.  ""It's just  hysteria.  We have carried out blood tests, urine tests, every kind of  test we can think of and nothing has shown up.""    More than a thosand young girls between 12 and 18 have suffered  attacks in some 40 schools across the country since the first cases  were reported over two weeks ago.    [...]    Lawmakers and commentators have attributed the fainting to everything  from food posoning to a plot by unamed enemy agents to make Egyptian  women infertile.     Similar attacks have been reported from time to time through Europe.  One was reported about a decade ago in the Israeli-Occupied Gaza  Strip.     Islamic fundamentalist leaders have blamed the Israeli secret service  for the spells.  ""This is all the work of the Mossad,"" said a militant  cleric in Imbaba, a Cairo slum.  ""They are seeding capsules around the  country that release something into the air that can't be detected.  It has a special effect on the hormones of young girls.  It is part of  a plot to destroy Egypt.""      [Where have seen this argument before?  Because there is no    evidence for the conspiracy, therefore it must be true...]    [...]    Health Minister Ragheb Dewidar said that neither medical or  environmental tests had found any contaminant and that the cause was  psychological.  ""If one girl who is popular or a leader feels faint  for some reason,"" he said, ""the others start believing that they are  suffering from the sypmtoms.""    But no one is taking the matter lightly.  Prime Minister Atef Sedki  has held regular mettings with Mr. Dewidar to discuss the attacks.  Government officials say they are determined to bring the phenomenon  to an end.    ""Parents and teachers should fight against these rumors and accept the  results of our scientific analysis,"" Education Minister Hussein Kamal  Bahadeen said.    ***********************************    You can't make this stuff up.

The war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion,  that doesn't mean we have to give up.  Only change the tactics.    For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.    Dealing Coke -- Death  Dealing Heroin -- Death  Dealing Pot -- Death  Dealing Crack -- Death    The list goes on and on!!!......    JUST KIDDING!!!    However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money   away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border   interdiction efforts.  (Don't think I'm going to say, ""spend it to educate   people"", because I know plenty of educated dopers).  Actually, spend it on    things like drug treatment programs.    I saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the British actually   prescribe and addict his ""recommended"" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,  or cut the amount down to levels where it is ""acceptable"".  Sounds good so far   from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out   the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)    However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be   bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a   recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.  The 60 Minute Report said it worked with ""cocaine"" cigarettes, pot and heroin.    Ryan "

If you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you  thought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using  was a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of  circumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they  do not apply, thus the action is not permisable.    Obviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it  would be contrary to the internet comercial use.    |>>|>Usenet does not distribute letterhead.  |>>  |>>Organization: DESYDeutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Experiment ZEUS bei HERA  |>  |>I suggest strongly that if you mean for this to be taken as letterhead you  |>get a better stationery designer.

Certainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to  call for the murder of Salman Rushdie.

Numbers, please.    That is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility  cost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe  to USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is  quite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and  regulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example  if a Microsoft employee were to post ""Windows NT is crap don't buy it""  from a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to  sack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has   political objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political  manner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political  platform for his views.      |>>I was refering to the arrogance of your position, quoting the words written  |>>by slave owners at me in the cause of freedom.  |>  |>Which words written by slave owners did I quote?

The initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable  judgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be  harmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the  substance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets  act could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already.  The part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.    Here again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that  information is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated  to third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this  case as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves.     The crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law.  The censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's  ludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book.       |>>|>You haven't any reason to believe that anything I've said has been reached  |>>|>unquestioningly.  |>>  |>>Only most of what you write.   |>  |>For someone who purports to be opposed to argument from assertion, you  |>certainly get by on assertions a lot.

You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the  validity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions.   Plus I am not an absolutist.

Furthermore I don't think that the  issues are half as simple as you imply.    |>>You may think that I am being anti-American in disallowing recourse to the  |>>first ammendment.

Your 2F2 cap  will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in  applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their  performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.  The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,  so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering  the cold).    You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,  that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every  1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would  need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the  firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz  oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator  remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.    I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the  solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.    Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't  guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable  conditions.

Just Wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throw  all the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old's  seizures.  He was having about one seizure per week.  She reported that  she did this on Thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on Saturday and then  went 4 weeks without a seizure!!  On Easter he went to Grandma's and ate   candy, pop - anything he wanted.  He had a seizure the next day.  She   sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  With  corn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.      With my own daughter (age 7) , I think she is also sensitive and stays  away from those foods on her own.  She has never had gum, won't eat  candy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won't  even use toothpaste!!!  Her brother, on the other hand, is a junk food  addict!      Hope this helps.  Good Luck. "

I've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really  surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known.   Losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for  arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very  conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the  weight gain.     For myself, I'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle  and sensible a diet I use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about  eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off.   Instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much  interest, like bread on the waters.      With this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  All I can  suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.    Meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a  balanced diet.  It's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-  parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and  which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.    Is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly  understood?  Is it just that I'm used to pediatrician-talk (""It's strep;  give him this and he'll get well."") and so my expectations are too high?       Bonita Kale     "

Mr. Read          said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and          then throwing the frog in.  His reflexes are so quick that          as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.          You must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it          up bit by bit.

But as          with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken          a little bit at a time.    The last line of the article says, ""It's not too late for us, but the  water is getting pretty warm.""

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate   onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh   envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.     You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized.   It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally,   the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi.   That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure   stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions  (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make   a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.     The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur  does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the   cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be   done there........      |>   |> They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads   |> (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course  |> any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the  |> US at great cost.

The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it   lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses   for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they   use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's   do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems   could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with   providing centaur GSE to Russia.

The cockpit  crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew  limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time  on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.    The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military  aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably  pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members  DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.    Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have  big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But  if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an  airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.  Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and  anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can.  Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.  Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies),  yawning--these will help all four causes.      --  Mary Shafer  DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, CA  shafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov                    Of course I don't speak for NASA   ""A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all.""

Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across  as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.      The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace  after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:     1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently      most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or      dictators.     2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

The ""near"" means that  it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),  not that it is ""nearly UV.""  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what  ""far UV"" is.)    Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the  near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the  visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are  going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as  fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV  sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The  shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.    It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes  in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively  cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to  be useful, but not dangerously so.    		-Ed Hall  		edhall@rand.org "

As ""Azerbaijan"" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction  of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In  particular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in  the most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the number  of the priority manufactures will be released from debts.   Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil   companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations.      THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN       Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis,  the chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif  Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.    This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But  the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't  be submitted for discussion.     Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon  a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for  the Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the   objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the  serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the  republic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,  ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion  on these questions.     The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,  when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.     The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50  deputates (25 ""democrats"" and 25 ""partocrates""). At that time ""democrats"" and  ""partocrates"" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long   time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,  the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon  a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out  of the Parliament. --0--      THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA        Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement  between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign   Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,  Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18.   The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of  Economics of Estonia.     The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,  the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the  republic.--0--      AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE       Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid  Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS  common economic zone.     Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a   common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic.   According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for  the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number  of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.     Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the  background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of  the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic  zone.--0--      THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW         Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director  of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic  along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to  hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan.   According to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.      As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent,   precise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other  questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in  Moscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling  of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.      When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end   of May.--0--      AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF  MAY         Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,  Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the  president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted  that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.       ""Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by   insistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis  of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6"",- said  Gasimov.       The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just  began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be   given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.       As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by  Armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--      THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN       BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced  that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers   condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent  people is unjustified.      Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,  prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units  and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they  served.      The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers  as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also   unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the  list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.     Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of  the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the  Russian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this  type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--      AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE  SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS         BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan  is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six  accused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives  of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation  to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will  be directed to Russian parliament.       According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give  Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the  investigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have  given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation  in the war against Azerbaijan.      ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE ""KARABAKHS"" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS         BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of   Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies  on the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the  newspaper ""Russky vestnik"" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.       The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the   documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of ""reunion"" of  the North Caucasus and ""Armenia proper"" at present, the front is appealing to   the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the  need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.       To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to  carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity ""identical to  those in Nagorno Karabakh"". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian  national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of  Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus   instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.       Thus according to the newspaper ""Russky vestnik"", ""new Karabakhs"" are   being planning on the North Caucasus. --O--      STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT         BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of  Azerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural  centers was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president  Elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and  culture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered.        The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a  legal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership  of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all   nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.       The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,  Hidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the ""undeclared  war"" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many   problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic  groups.        For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of  Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture   and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign  diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of  free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary).        As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted  to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of  Azerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened,   radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the  educational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national  teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences  of Azerbaijan.--O--       MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED         BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State   concern ""Azerineft"", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies  ""AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum"", ""Bi-Pi Exploration Operating"", ""Pennzoil  Caspian"", ""Unocal Khazar Ltd."", ""McDermott"" and Turkish oil corporation on  mutual extracting of fields ""Azeri"", ""Chirag"" and ""Gyuneshli"" was signed.   According to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common  program of activity was created.        According to the president of ""Azerineft"", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation  will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently.        During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of  oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of  exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the  exploitation of these fields.   The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical  and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas  fields. --O--      ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS         BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on   six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,  Armenian propaganda has become actively involved.       The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin  with a request ""to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian  soldiers"". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings  on the case in Baku as ""a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia"".       The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could  believe the Yerevan agency ""Snark"", the Armenians in Karabakh presented  an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum  is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in  Karabakh will be shot dead.       It is simple to explain such ""touching attitude of Armenians"" to  the six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed  it will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused  Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister  of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.       If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its  saving of lives of ""innocent Russians"". --O--      NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA         BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of  Azerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan  from the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.       The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,  Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from  Kafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were  destructions in the villages.       On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,  Shynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of  Azerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in  progress.       At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of  Armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated  into the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two  shepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a  flock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--      ""UNOCAL"" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN         BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the  representation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this  company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of  50 houses for refugees.       At present, the American side suggested a village project for   consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project  is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary  accommodations and so on.       According to the program the construction and putting into  operation of the village will be this year. --O--      MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE         BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the  national currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian  Ruble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.  Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with   respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value  10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is  the same at banks, state establishments and in trade.       According to the representatives of the business circles and  experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles  are bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial  operations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics  of the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen  arrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business   with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much   Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--      THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY        Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the  expert group, including representatives of the Parliament and   presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution  of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before  the Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new  Constitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of  the country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the  press-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.      Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and   representatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev  and Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.      The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary  election law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill  didn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative  variant of the election law was put forward.     The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions  will examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all  proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--      ISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR   CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED       BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the  Azerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman  of the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with  the conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant  K. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the  Supreme Court of Azerbaijan.     In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan  Milly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme  Soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal  case. In his view, ""the conclusion of the commission could help in the   objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems  in the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the  knowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime"".     In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,  Milly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the  permanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human  rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of  this problem.--0--      WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?          Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative  to the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the   Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with  the representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case  the peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.       Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors  of the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is  paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from  the peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and  US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial  US departure from Transcaucasia.--0--      FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER       Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,  Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of  oil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.  As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-  RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian  fields.     According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete  treaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and  PENNZOIL will sign treaties.     Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645  million ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton  on Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.     The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to  bring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net  economic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in  the defence of its interests at the international scene.     As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement ""the May of  1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its  independence and we have to stand these tests"".--0--    THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN       BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan  informs, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the  Russian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.  The appeal contains the call ""to display mercy, humanism and clemency   on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed  Forces"".     The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the  participation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,  don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce  the mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the  Russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.      At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'  mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the  president of Azerbaijan to ""save those guys"".     It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,  taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only  Russian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down  lives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made  answerable.      Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers  of Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--      ARMENIAN ARTILLERY CONTINUES FIRING ON AZERI DISTRICTS         BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: On May 22, two soldiers of National army of  Azerbaijan were killed during the ""Grad"" shelling of the villages of  Kolly Gyshlag, Shaifly, Shotaraz, Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of  the republic from the territory of Kafan district of Armenia.       The night before and in the morning of May 22, the villages of  Tovuz, Gazakh and Gubatly districts of Azerbaijan were under fire  from the territory of Armenia. There are destructions.        The situation in Agder district of Azerbaijan became complicated.   On May 21, the enemy fired on the regional centre of Agdere from the  village of Ortakend. The transportation of man power and military equipment  to this district is in progress. According to reports the enemy is setting  up a new weapon emplacement to fire on the regional centre and near by  villages.       According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the concentration  of man power and military equipment is observed in Krasnoselsky  district of Armenia which borders on Azerbaijan as well as on the  frontier with Fizuli district. --O--      AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN      BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,  Rauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that  ""Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan  after Iran"". The business cooperation between the two countries  develops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil  extraction equipment, communication and agriculture.    According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of  Azerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May  23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will  help, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch  offices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude  contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on  building in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the  entire communication system of Azerbaijan.     In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain  will have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.     According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great  Britain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of  the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--               \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\                T U R A N    N E W S    A G E N C Y                       Baku - Azerbaijan                        Phone: (8922) 66-7977  66-7833                      Fax: (8922) 66-2009                     Telex: 142168 META SU             \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\                      Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

The part number is BU 406 and I believe the vender is  SGS thomas judging by teh SGS logo printed on the package.  If anyone  has teh spec for this part I would greatly appreciate an email with  the import info so I can find a replacement.  Thanx in advance.    -Dave  dnewman@lynx.northeastern.edu    BTW I don't need people telling me to throw the computer away.

2,"  First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,  not humans.    Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an  uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's  terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be  turned into heat.    2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled  amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the  reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous.  It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than  play around with 2,4-DNP.    But if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your own  university library.  You can obtain 2,4-DNP by taking a first year  organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's  a commonly-used reagent). "

Even as a libertarian, I have to admit government does do some things I  like.  There is a beautiful performing arts complex in Ft.  Lauderdale  that was partially built with tax dollars (I don't know how much was  private and how much was stolen, I mean public) but it is beautiful and  I enjoy it.  (Keep in mind, though, most of the people in the city will  never attend a single performance there, so they might feel differently  about having to help pay for it.)    However, I have to disagree about it being desireable or efficient to  give government intervention-power on a case-by-case basis.  In fact,  we have a lot better luck maintaining our freedom of speech precisely  because it is not decided on a case-by-case basis as much as other  issues.  Judges decide whether political speech is allowed on the  sidewalk in front of the post office.  They do not try to decide just  whether pro-nazi, pro-choice, pro-life, or pro-tax political speech  should be allowed on the sidewalk in front of the post office.  You can  imagine the result if right to free speech was decided by the majority  on a case-by-case basis.    Not so with economic issues.  Government does tell taxi-drivers exactly  what they can charge, but not the bus lines or the lawyers.    Just as it is not desireable to decide rights of free speech on a  case-by-case basis, we should not decide rights to free enterprise on a  case-by-case basis.    There is hope that a government can be restricted from interferring with  free enterprise.  But there is no hope, in my opinion, of having a  government that interferes with free enterprise in an ""efficient""  manner; I call it political market failure.    Thus, if you value freedom and the abundance it produces, you have to  swallow the ""whole libertarian agenda.""    Roger Collins "
2,"Sender: khayash@hsc.usc.edu  Message-ID: <1rkt01$kt5@hsc.usc.edu>  NNTP-Posting-Host: hsc.usc.edu    Mike Adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight  to the human being.  I love this topic, as some of you regulars know.    So, having seen Henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk  about it; I shall.    I feel that we as a community of people have unique resources  to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate  on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent   as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and   probably more.  I do not believe that the general public understands  the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  In the absence  of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.    I believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only  communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.    A well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science  variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long  expenditions to the moon or Mars) would be entertaining and educational  to the general public.  The objective of such an effort would be to   compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical  journals which would address each major life science area.  In addition,  ideas for further research and development could be put forward for  the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take  part in the excitement of exploration.    Individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week  to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  In addition,  we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls  of NASA and industry.    I have appreciated the positive responses to date and I am personally  eager to start this project.  Perhaps we could start with debate regarding  how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application  to spaceflight.    ken "
2,"  Since electrical wiring questions do turn up from time to time on  sci.electronics (and the answers aren't always apparent, even to those skilled  in electronics), I am hijacking the following FAQ and posting a copy here.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers    	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not  	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If  	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't  	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,  	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;  	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.    	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National  	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).  	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail  	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections  	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,  	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!    	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the  	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,  	however, do not.  Check your with your local building  	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in  	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,  	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements  	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that  	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family  	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial  	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different  	rules.    	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in  	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary  	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.  	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line  	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number  	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've  	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or  	``CEC''.    	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often  	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.    Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?    	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the  	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.  	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.  	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly  	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the  	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged  	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.  	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized  	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the  	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for  	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --  	US$65 plus shipping and handling.    Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?    	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up  	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance  	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.  	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two  	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,  	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.  	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified  	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA  	standard itself.  In this FAQ, ""CEC"" really means the  	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is  	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th  	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th  	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an  	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.    	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical  	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In  	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't  	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I  	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the  	equivalent NEC publications.    	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout  	the province.    Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?    	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.  	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical  	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's  	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do  	wiring in ""commercial"" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)  	are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"".  However,  	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial  	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can  	find one willing to supervise.    	If you do your own wiring, an important point:    	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better  	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,  	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make  	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills  	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.  	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that  	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,  	and will impress the inspector.    	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to  	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your  	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.  	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely  	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.    	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.    	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip  	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector  	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it  	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of  	12ga wire through your hand that way.    	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C  	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types  	become very brittle.    Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?    	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few  	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're   	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved  	devices) you need Robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers  	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.    	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or  	3/8"" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or  	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill  	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and  	3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull  	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even  	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.    	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you  	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws  	work well).  	  	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or  	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart ""combo stripper,  	crimper and bottle opener"" types.  You should expect to pay  	$15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair.  It will have sized  	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should  	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the  	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There  	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't  	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.    	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends  	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.    	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.    	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling  	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire  	loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more  	accurate.    	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for  	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the  	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,  	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a  	""zipper"", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip  	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to  	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley  	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)  	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility  	that you'll gouge the conductors.    	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well  	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).  	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire  	or the insulation.    	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired  	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more  	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple  	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated  	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost  	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.    	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are  	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)  	and work well.  If you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is  	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known  	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)    	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.  	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or  	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.    	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent  	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for  	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap   	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination  	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to  	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet  	that has no cover plate).    Subject: What is UL listing?    	The UL stands for ""Underwriters Laboratory"".  It used to be  	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent  	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment  	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means  	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements  	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily  	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just  	that it probably won't kill you.    	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are  	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,  	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will  	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to  	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in  	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component  	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.  	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring  	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or  	occupancy permits issued.  	  Subject: What is CSA approval?    	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the  	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in  	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done  	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to  	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is  	required by law.    	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved  	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the  	claim.    	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC  	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to  	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance  	companies.    Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?    	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers    	    Residential Wiring  	    by Jeff Markell,  	    Craftsman Books,  	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.    	    Practical Electrical Wiring  	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National  	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70  	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan  	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.    	    Wiring Simplified  	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan  	    Park Publishing Co.  	  	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC  	revision.  Which is currently 1990.    	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called  	""Electrical Code Simplified"".  There appears to be a version  	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the  	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,  	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get  	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer  	questions on the net ;-).    	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is  	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.    Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?    	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and  	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more  	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not  	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections  	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors  	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose  	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.    	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your  	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a  	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about  	this.    	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at  	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage  	claims.    	In general, the process goes like this:  		- you apply to your local inspections office or building  		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or  		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is  		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not  		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose  		  special conditions on you, require loading  		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point  		  they will tell you which inspections you will need.  		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to  		  have the panel and service connections inspected  		  before your power utility will provide a connection.  		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority  		  rather than the usual inspectors.  		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before  		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a  		  ""rough-in"" inspection.  		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,  		  you will need a ""final inspection"".    Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.  	Do I have to upgrade?    	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,  	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some  	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the  	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you  	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all  	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.    Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240    	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the  	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of  	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V  	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same  	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required  	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.  	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there  	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not  	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped  	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially  	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number  	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,  	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.  	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110V"" and  	""220V"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will  	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.    	One thing that might make this a little more understandable  	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V  	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device  	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that  	low.    	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between  	phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any  	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""Y""  	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.    	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended  	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...    Subject: What does an electrical service look like?    	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the  	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility  	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.     	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded   	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes   	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where  	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic  	action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)).  	This is the ""grounding conductor"".  It is there to make sure that  	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire  	normally carries no current.    	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or  	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.  	It is connected to the ""centre tap"" (CEC; ""center tap"" in the  	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It  	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often  	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected  	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.    	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in  	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.  	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral  	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional  	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house  	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.    	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually  	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are  	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one  	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations   	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do  	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your  	inspector.    	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot""  	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as  	well.    	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each  	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,  	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the  	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.    	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.  	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected  	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one  	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some  	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only  	service).    Subject: What is a circuit?    	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.  	These connections are then used to supply power to selected  	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:  		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.  		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.  		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,  		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.    	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and  	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying  	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they  	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several  	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is  	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or  	air conditioners.    	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar  	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there  	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral  	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing  	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead  	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.  	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles  	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but  	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,  	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to  	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is  	permissible.]    	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,  	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.    	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a  	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.    	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground  	wire.  Since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the NEC and CEC  	requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends  	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail  	polish or sometimes electrical tape.    	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the  	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.    	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)  	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places  	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"",  	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an  	alternative to GFCI protection.    Subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"".    	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the  	""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green  	or bare wire.  The word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when  	you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire.  Since the white  	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the  	panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"".  However, the  	potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding  	conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should  	never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire  	as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected  	together in the panel.    	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground  	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]    	In the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used  	for ""grounded conductor"".  This FAQ uses ""neutral"" simply to  	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use ""neutral""  	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light  	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.    Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?    	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power  	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For  	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should  	""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As  	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the  	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the  	equipment itself won't cause a fire.    	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt  	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby  	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively  	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have  	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use  	a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid  	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a  	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be  	replaced.    	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They  	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched  	into position against another contact.  When the current flow  	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip  	heats up and bends.  By bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the  	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave  	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to  	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high  	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite  	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown  	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which  	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in  	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the  	purpose.    	Neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se.  A dead  	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even  	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which  	can often cause severe damage.    Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?    	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher  	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually  	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts  	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse  	being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a  	penny"" trick.    	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better  	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.    	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When  	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting  	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,  	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical  	distribution transformer and having your house burn down.  	Breakers don't do this.    	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit  	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new  	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special  	inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)    	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse  	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse  	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the  	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently  	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you  	if you need one.    Subject: What size wire should I use?    	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,  	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,  	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid  	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than  	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.    	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for  	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or  	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate  	heat easily:    		Gauge		Amps  		14		15  		12		20  		10		30  		8		40  		6		65  	  	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent  	on the application and precise wire type.    Subject: Where do these numbers come from?    	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.  	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When  	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is  	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need  	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in  	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long  	runs.    	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.  	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller  	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most  	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits  	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger  	wire.    Subject: What does ""14-2"" mean?    	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors  	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second  	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but  	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  ""14-2"" means  	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.    	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes  	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In  	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.    	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.  	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.    Subject: What is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""?  How are they  	used?    	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used  	to connect wires together.  ""Marrette"" or ""Marr connector""  	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.    	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them  	together, then twist the wirenut on.    	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the  	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically  	secure.    	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check  	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the  	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.    	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or  	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers,  	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes  	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it  	goes in the wirenut properly.    	Some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical  	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may  	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because  	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead  	of taping it, the connection should be redone.    Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?    	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures  	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the  	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the  	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other  	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of  	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any  	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking  	the circuit.    	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,  	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral  	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI  	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot  	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the  	GFCI happy.    	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.  	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed  	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be  	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices  	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be  	covered by a single GFCI outlet.    Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?    	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase  	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,  	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or  	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water  	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,  	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',  	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and  	laundry appliances.    	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there  	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or  	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you  	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to  	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.    	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may  	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI  	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI  	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in  	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your  	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?  	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does  	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?    Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?    	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a  	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run  	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,  	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs  	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that  	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary  	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most  	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no  	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring  	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.    Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?    	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the  	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with  	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI  	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE  	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one  	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch  	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),  	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a  	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;  	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on  	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such  	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.    	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use  	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use  	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.    	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one  	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't  	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first  	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet  	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But  	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.    	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little  	""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark  	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which  	outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the GFCI with the  	test button and see which outlets are dead.    Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?    	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,  	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without  	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against  	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of  	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an  	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the  	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly  	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not  	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if  	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of  	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very  	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace  	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).    	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In  	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with  	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating  	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will  	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;  	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were  	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to  	ground...    Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization    	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the  	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)  	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.  	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the  	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to  	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).    	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.    	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right  	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the  	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the  	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.  	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which  	prong the terminating screw connects to.    Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?    	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance  	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex  	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more  	than 24"" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider  	than 12"" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.  	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except  	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits  	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,  	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be  	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).    	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab  	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to  	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.  	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When  	""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be  	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral  	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect  	from downstream outlets.    Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?    	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to  	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in  	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.    Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?    	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.  	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.  	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside  	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject  	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are  	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several  	different categories of NM cable.    	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""AC"" has a  	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is  	fairly resistant to damage.    	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic  	sheath.  	  	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable  	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer  	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (CEC & NEC)  	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected  	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of  	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.    	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored  	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,  	but this is technically illegal.]    	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the  	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague  	references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the NEC  	and CEC):    	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage  	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls  	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.  	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.  	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces  	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian  	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet  	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable  	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance.  	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.  	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating  	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by  	      means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation  	      material (a wad of fiberglass).  	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box  	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.  	      Holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"".  	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to  	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,  	      it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical]  	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.  	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring  	      to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured  	      in the breach...]  	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or  	      similar finish.  	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.  	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists  	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more  	      than 1m (39"").    	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small  	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to  	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through  	the insulation.    	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by  	solid wall coverings.    	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of  	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a  	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of  	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the  	wire.    	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.    	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will  	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like  	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of  	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground  	wiring section.]     	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be   	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that   	purpose.    	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through  	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed  	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this  	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses  	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.  	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.  	   	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,   	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the   	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: ""AC90"" versus ""AC"".  	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.    	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes  	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.  	There are very different requirements for mobile homes.  	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything  	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable  	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box  	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic  	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.    	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable  	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still  	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also  	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.    	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for  	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground  	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other  	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For  	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.    Subject: Junction box positioning?    	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.    	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible  	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction  	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may  	get nasty.    Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?    	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few  	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage  	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half  	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire  	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle  	constraints as well.  For example, older house  	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess  	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the  	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.  	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high  	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your  	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case  	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)    	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some  	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and  	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy  	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box  	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling  	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available  	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and  	mounted between the joists.    	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as  	""pot"" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated  	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.  	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated  	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually  	8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering  	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*  	long)    	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3""  	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.  	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,  	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.  	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't  	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector  	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get  	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown  	in later.]    	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and  	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are  	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat  	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should  	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.  	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location  	for the sensor can vary.    	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved  	for use in insulation.  The ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach.    Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?    	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is  	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up  	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with  	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can  	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in  	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions  	require the stove frame connected to neutral).    	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately  	and have them come and check out the problem.    	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with  	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A  	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness  	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.    Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?    	Three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of  	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors  	because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque,  	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.    	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows  	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between  	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal  	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the  	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.    	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually  	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you  	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to  	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is  	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have  	a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a  	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if  	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to  	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an  	article on how to do this if you must.    	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using  	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.    Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?    	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there  	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply  	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times  	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also  	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor  	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the  	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.    	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more  	than 50 feet long.    Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?    	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746  	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,  	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200  	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,  	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational  	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.    	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router  	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far  	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a ""stall  	horsepower"" or similar.  That means the power is measured when  	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.  	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that  	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker  	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far  	more current than it can continuously.    	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This  	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,  	check the amperage rating, which is always present.    Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?    	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead  	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety  	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither  	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.    	There are several different approaches to solving this:  	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the  	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect  	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle  	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.  	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and  	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can  	       run a conductor to it from the third prong.  	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.  	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug  	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI  	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI  	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong  	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,  	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it  	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault  	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected  	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't  	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath  	       on BX cable.    	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three  	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.  	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.    Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?  	Should the test button work?    	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,  	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's  	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE  	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current  	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.  	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require  	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press  	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:  	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially  	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.    	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground  	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The  	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the  	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never  	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,  	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device  	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded  	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are  	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician  	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require  	it, and promised to investigate.)    Subject: How should I wire my shop?    	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all  	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies  	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the  	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for  	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or  	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have  	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp  	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles  	which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment.  Lights  	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared  	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two  	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a  	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand  	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.    	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the  	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.  	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each  	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same  	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and  	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have  	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit  	wrong.    	Note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring""  	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used  	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be  	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.    	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V  	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.  	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you  	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled  	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of  	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much  	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)    	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,  	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop  	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to  	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.  	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''  	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.  	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to  	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy  	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.    	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished  	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And  	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop  	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might  	have a different idea.    	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop  	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.    Subject: Underground Wiring    	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use  	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic  	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots  	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion  	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is  	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically  	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,  	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion  	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And  	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.    	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to  	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about  	your specific situation.    	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power  	line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.    Subject: Aluminum wiring    	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became  	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,  	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,  	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.  	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new  	wiring.    	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum  	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.  	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper  	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential  	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.    	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as  	""cold creep"".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When  	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes  	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each  	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes  	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance  	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/  	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,  	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even  	cause a fire.    	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move  	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of  	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing  	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you  	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring  	for the following things:    	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to  	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will  	       be stamped with ""Al/Cu"" or ""CO/ALR"".  The latter supersedes  	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat  	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.    	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around  	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be  	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the  	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug  	       up each connection.    	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the  	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.    	    3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.  	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with  	       the proper screw connections immediately.    	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,  	       melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures.  Any such damage should  	       be repaired.  	      	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be  	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the  	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting  	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be  	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an  	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter  	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless  	       you can rent the tool.    	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring  	       by means of a short copper ""pigtail"".  See (5) above.  	      	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped  	       (not nicked) wire etc.        	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring  	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider  	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,  	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,  	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having  	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.  	You can do this yourself too.    Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?    	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire  	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.  	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an  	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor  	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any  	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many  	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.    	Here's some hints on what to look for:    	Obvious non-code wiring can include:    		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls  		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without  		  proper marking.  		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of  		  a GFCI)  		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)  		- Switched neutrals  		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines    	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one  	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:    		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps  		   not properly terminated wiring)  		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are  		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when  		  it's *really* convenient ;-)  		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations  		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps  		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them  		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or  		  ceiling  		- Backwrapped grounding wires    Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring  	  	In the years since Edison ""invented"" electricity, several different  	wiring ""styles"" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you  	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old   	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.    	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called  	""knob and tube"" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with  	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural  	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).  	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections  	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping  	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,  	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs  	down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture.  	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some  	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same  	colour as the hot wires.    	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.    	Comments on K&T:    		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about  		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.  		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up  		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in  		  quite good condition.  		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.  		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with  		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,  		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.  		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between  		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to  		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on  		  any circuit.  		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls  		  that contain K&T.  		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be  		  tricky.  Consult your inspector.  		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more  		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.  	  	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't  	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should  	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and  	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly  	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on  	new circuits using modern techniques.  	  	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type  	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks  	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was  	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.  	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback  	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole  	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at  	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.    	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if  	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as  	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.  	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several  	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink  	tubing.    	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.  	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.  	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard  	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be  	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff -  	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.    Subject: Where do I buy stuff?    	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their  	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or  	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety  	including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that  	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable  	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.  --   Chris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541  Psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca  Ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca "

Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the  same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.    #1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want  to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll   *implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the  glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any  case, don't kick it around! :-)     #2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned  out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess  the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it  created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't  shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying  around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it  being more than 50 cents!.    Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set of  schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around  the flyback.   "

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost,  and you don't want to clip off the panels each time.

2,"  A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was  discovered.  It had produced a dull pain in that area.  The hernia  was repaired using the least intrusive (orthoscopic?) method and a  ""plug and patch"".    The doctor considered the procedure a success.    A few months later the same pain returned.  The doctor said that  he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair.    Now the pain occurs more often.  My GP couldn't identify any  specific problem.  The surgen who performed the original procedure  now says that yes there is a ""new"" hernia in the same area and he  said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time.    My question to the net:  Is there a nonintrusive method to  determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from  something else?    Steve Heffner "

I'm going to count on the supposition that you think  through the opinions you have - something which is, by the way, against  my better judgment based on what I've seen from you to date.  We are  agreed, aren't we, that dictionaries are *reference books* for the usage  of a given language, and in particular for the meanings of the words and  phrases which comprise that language?  Now, you are using meanings  completely different from, indeed in some cases diametrically different  from, those given in the dictionary.  As a reference book, a dictionary  contains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current  use.  That's also why they are updated so often.  Now, if you are saying  things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does, and  using non-standard meanings about every word, what is your chance of  being taken at face value...?    Just about none.  Just about no one will take you that way because the  words mean something different to them.  It's quite clear to me from  the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is  happening.  Ponder that.      >>>And guess why.

I just   >said that it is curious, considering how heterogeneous the movement is.    What you did was ask a leading question.  In English idiom, the phrase  ""and guess why..."" in the way you used it is a loaded question, with  only one answer expected.      I also take offense at being told I cannot read by someone who is  obviously having trouble with the subject himself.  Mr. Pinkas, I am a  PhD candidate in my field.

Rutin is a bioflavonoid, compounds found (among other places) in the  rinds of citrus fruits.

So why is Cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?    Note: I think Cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, I'd buy   a bunch of their stuff :).    One thing that Clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of   security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.  This means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to   deploy.  This is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you   look at it :).    > Indeed, even without special engineering, you can construct a good   > system right now.

Where can I buy it?    Another note: If ""Clipper"" increases the incentive to bring stronger   encryption to the mass market, all the better.  It's far overpriced at   the moment.    > Yes, cheap crypto is good -- but we don't need it from the government.

If you have a tape you should note that there are two towers at either end  of the building, a big one and a little one. What appears to be merely a   long shot of the big tower with the tank in front is in fact the little  tower.

You keep making  these assertions, but you haven't supported any of them yet.  I am speaking of statutes that conflict with the definition  Larry posted.

Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit  your needs.  The principle of protecting life is abandoned based  on ""action versus inaction.""  Not much of a principle.

Such a measure would also have another benefit. It would relieve the  various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds  of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'm  sure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically  (not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animal  rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than  willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased  taxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident that  these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social  responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally  and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the  hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands  solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To  do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in  the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and  politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and  subsequent development and urbanization of these former private  hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any  benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.

2,"  One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMG  channels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.  If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be  sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per  channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should  be rather easy to accomplish.    Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without  generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is  in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to  keep balanced.    A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with  a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.  Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws  govern the use of transeivers in your location.      --   Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department  Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511  wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED "

I upgraded my motherboard last fall.  I  would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to  reinstall simply because I changed motherboards.    	Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum.  Are you  going to require that a user re-install all their software if they add 4Mb  of RAM to their computer?  I did that a couple of weeks ago.  It's in the  BIOS, and if software had told me ""this isn't the machine you installed me  on"" I would never have used that software again.  Really bad idea.    > I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's   > conscience should do that.    	This is silly.  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let  them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk, and then give  them that.  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.    > You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable  > the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)    	Do you know any assembly language at all?  All anyone needs to do if  find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a JMP instruction  to just completely skip it.  Not that difficult, really!  And there is very  little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing.  Using PKLITE or  some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE  were tagged as uncompressable.    > What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus  > a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup  > ""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above.    	This is by far the best idea you presented in your post.  Making it  plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates.

2,"Nntp-Posting-Host: autarch.acsu.buffalo.edu    HI, I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related  subjects. I am currently learning about AM/FM receivers and recieving  circuits. I understand a lot of things ,but a few things I am confused  abuot. The first is the MIXER, to mix the RF and local oscillator  frequencies to make the IF. Does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as  simple as possible) for this kind of mixer? I have come across a  MC-SBL mixer chip But I have not been able to find it in any catalogs  (ACTIVE,etc...)     Along the same note, are there any SIMPLE fm receiver circuits anyone  may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.    P.S. any REALLY GOOD BOOKS on AM/FM theory ALONG WITH DETAILED  ELECTRICAL DIAGRAMS would help a lot.  I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of  circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.    				Thanks,    				Mark Musone "
2,"          A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland      on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous      pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near      Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part      was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They      were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became      enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle      of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby      forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were      visible till morning sunrise.        The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in      Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in      the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was      only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.      A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a      spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about      five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the      upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop      became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of      the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright      spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails      were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still      visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.        The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if      there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near      Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969      we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of      these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium      experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we      have observed 17 satellite launches.

2,"  I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after  I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training  day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of  the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale,  and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that  heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few   minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with  chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But  I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued  arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my  usual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of  the day.    My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --  my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal  and it is no longer cold.     Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through  my brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise  regimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar  cause these symptoms (I hope)?    Has this happened to anyone else?  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  Does it come with age?    Thanks,  Tom  --   Tom Molnar  Unix Systems Group, University of Toronto Computing & Communications. "

1,"  Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the  _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television  station, KTVB Channel 7.    Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.    Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.    Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that  Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National  Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge  asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because  of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.    The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently  ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither  by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.    The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,  who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person  named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as  an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms  in his dealings with Randy Weaver.    Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an  Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two  then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in  time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons  transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he  (Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the  White cause.""    The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and  later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second  meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to  tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-  gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of  19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge  shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of  24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel  length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver  is reported to have said that he could perform better work once  his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility  of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars  for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty  dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have  simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -  over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).    The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that  his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead  of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver  suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in  Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince  Weaver otherwise.    The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were  made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these  meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also  reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki  Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must  have also been phone taps.    These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and  loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's  attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to  make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a  case at all..."" according to the rules.    Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his  wife's voice on the tape.    U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear  accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the  Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect  this trial is not explained.    Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning  Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are  surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were  surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained  in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy  Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that  Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report  that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming  at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics  are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the  only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and  Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that  Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.    Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial.   Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.    "

For a single 64-bit input block, a  one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64  output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into  a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the  one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it  will be decrypted properly.

How much data per     bit will be lost in average (I assume you still have the correct key)?    It depends on the mode you're using DES in.  Electronic Code Book (ECB) takes a block of 64 input bits  and produces 64 output bits, so if any bits are changed,  the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad.  I forget which feedback mode is which.  In all of them, the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks.  With some modes, the system self-synchronizes, so errors are repaired  in a few blocks.  With other modes, once one block is bad,  all later blocks will be bad too.    There's also the framing problem.  If you have a bit change,  the block that it's in changes, and maybe later blocks also change.  But if you have bits lost or bits added (64 bits in, 63 or 65 bits out),  everything is confused after that.    --------------------------------------------------------------------    From: Marcus J Ranum <mjr@TIS.COM>    	depends on the mode you're using. cfb, for example, synchronises  pretty fast. figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the  next one.    mjr.    --------------------------------------------------------------------    ---  Experience is what you get if you don't get what you want...

The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first  question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than  ""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the  Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential  applications for this.    However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't  coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy  of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where  this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion  is useful only in special situations, however.    What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,  and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy  *into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.

1,"     There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.     Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely     at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if     it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences     as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see     them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,     there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15     from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or  some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had  elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them  did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic  Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal  Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now it's also called Chronic Fatigue  and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that  some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.    Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively  swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that there's  nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the  syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The  disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers  on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:  psychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --  maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental  toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of  these.    There's no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try  different things, some of which seem to help.    Massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.  Post your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.    Note: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)  diseases that look like CFIDS. Make sure these get ruled-out by a good  doc.   "

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically  modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600  might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight  of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.    Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for  their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I  would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking  with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the  2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).  Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into  a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to  backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could  be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them  into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.    Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got  two 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa  cartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and  handling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo  (interested in that too?).    Hope that helps your question...

1,"    Here is a press release from the White House.     Text of President Clinton's Letter to Congress on Iranian Assets   To: National Desk   Contact: White House Press Office, 202-456-2100       WASHINGTON, May 14  -- Following is a letter  President Clinton wrote to Congress on Iranian Assets:      TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:           I hereby report to the Congress on developments since the    last Presidential report on November 10, 1992, concerning the    national emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in    Executive Order No. 12170 of November 14, 1979, and matters    relating to Executive Order No. 12613 of October 29, 1987.    This report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the    International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c),    and section 505(c) of the International Security and Development    Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa-9(c).  This report    covers events through March 31, 1993.  The last report, dated    November 10, 1992, covered events through October 15, 1992.           1.  There have been no amendments to the Iranian    Transactions Regulations (""ITRs""), 31 CFR Part 560, or to the    Iranian Assets Control Regulations (""IACRs""), 31 CFR Part 535,    since the last report.           2.  The Office of Foreign Assets Control (""FAC"") of the    Department of the Treasury continues to process applications    for import licenses under the ITRs.  However, as previously    reported, recent amendments to the ITRs have resulted in a    substantial decrease in the number of applications received    relating to the importation of nonfungible Iranian-origin goods.           During the reporting period, the Customs Service has    continued to effect numerous seizures of Iranian-origin    merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import    prohibitions of the ITRs.  FAC and Customs Service investi-    gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions    and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  Additional    forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.           3.  The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (the    ""Tribunal""), established at The Hague pursuant to the Algiers    Accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims    before it.  Since the last report, the Tribunal has rendered    12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  Of that total, 367 have    been awards in favor of American claimants:  222 of these were    awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of    settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions    adjudicated on the merits.  The Tribunal has issued 36 decisions    dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing    claims for jurisdictional reasons.  Of the 59 remaining awards,    3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of    Iranian claimants.  As of March 31, 1993, awards to successful    American claimants from the Security Account held by the    NV Settlement Bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.           As of March 31, 1993, the Security Account has fallen    below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  Iran has    periodically replenished the account, as required by the Algiers    Accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by    the NV Settlement Bank in which interest on the Security Account    is deposited.  Iran has also replenished the account with the    proceeds from the sale of Iranian-origin oil imported into the    United States, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-    case basis by FAC.  Iran has not, however, replenished the    account since the last oil sale deposit on October 8, 1992.    The aggregate amount that has been transferred from the Interest    Account to the Security Account is $874,472,986.47.  As of    March 31, 1993, the total amount in the Security Account was    $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the Interest Account    was $8,638,133.15.           4.  The Tribunal continues to make progress in the    arbitration of claims of U.S. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.    Since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.    More than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been    disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary    withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  The larger    claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their    complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable    awards to the U.S. claimants.  For example, two claimants were    awarded more than $130 million each by the Tribunal in October    1992.           5.  As anticipated by the May 13, 1990, agreement settling    the claims of U.S. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the    Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (""FCSC"") has continued its    review of 3,112 claims.  The FCSC has issued decisions in    1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  The    FCSC expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining    claims in early 1994.           6.  In coordination with concerned Government agencies,    the Department of State continues to present United States    Government claims against Iran, as well as responses by the    United States Government to claims brought against it by Iran.    In November 1992, the United States filed 25 volumes of    supporting information in case B/1 (Claims 2 & 3), Iran's claim    against the United States for damages relating to its Foreign    Military Sales Program.  In February of this year, the United    States participated in a daylong prehearing conference in   several other cases involving military equipment.  Iran also    filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure    of U.S. courts to enforce an award against a U.S. corporation    violated the Algiers Accords.           7.  As reported in November, Jose Maria Ruda, President of    the Tribunal, tendered his resignation on October 2, 1992.  No    successor has yet been named.  Judge Ruda's resignation will    take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up    his duties.           8.  The situation reviewed above continues to involve    important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the    United States and its nationals.  Iran's policy behavior    presents challenges to the national security and foreign    policy of the United States.  The IACRs issued pursuant to    Executive Order No. 12170 continue to play an important role    in structuring our relationship with Iran and in enabling    the United States to implement properly the Algiers Accords.    Similarly, the ITRs issued pursuant to Executive Order No. 12613    continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-    national terrorism.  I shall exercise the powers at my disposal    to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the    Congress on significant developments.                               WILLIAM J. CLINTON        THE WHITE HOUSE,        May 14, 1993.     -30-        --   Nigel Allen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada  ae446@freenet.carleton.ca "

Who gets to keep what parts of Judea and Samaria will be determined in  a peace settlement.  Obviously, Israel will keep some, and the Arabs  will get some.    Israel has tried to get out of Gaza almost from the time it got stuck  with it.  It has been refused by the Arabs several times.  Although  there are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up, I  seriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in any  settlement.    The Golan Heights is a serious security problem, and Israel obviously  will have to keep part of it and give up part of it.  (One should  remember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was to  be in Britain's Palestine Mandate, slated to become part of the Jewish  state, until Britain traded it to France for other considerations.  In  other words, it is an historical accident that it was ever part of  Syria.)  --   Alan H. Stein                     astein@israel.nysernet.org "

2,"  Suppose the Soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working  and had made it first.  They could have beaten us if either:    * Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,    and/or    * A Saturn V went boom.    If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone  head and done some landings, but we also would have been more  determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the  Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend  upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base  would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think  that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value  of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would  have concentrated on the moon.      /~~~(-: James T.

The central section   housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof   mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The   proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation   pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered   around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.         TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The   2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a   single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be   powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).         Further info on TRIAD, DISCOS, etc. can be found in ""Spacecraft Design   Innovations in the APL Space Department,"" Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest,   Vol. 13, No. 1 (1992).                                                          --Eric Hoffman               "

HOWEVER, every US citizen has a general export license, allowing  export of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech.  This has the effect that it is legal for US citizens to export some  things which it is illegal for a US corporation to export without  first obtaining a license.       > Dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have; the only     > way to find out is to apply for a license.       Nope, talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.  But, in  general, the government has to have a very good national security case  to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to  publish.  (Yes, I worded that the way I did intentionally.  It is a  lot easier for the government to TRY to prevent the export of  information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact.  Espionage is probably the only exception.)       > Note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send     > to Canada if YOU have such a license, and what is legal to send     > if you don't.        If you are a US citizen, you have a general license.  (I am not a  lawyer, so take some of this with a grain of salt.

2,"Message-ID: <1r7n8n$okv@access.digex.net>  NNTP-Posting-Host: access.digex.net    Hi,    I've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few   concerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing   her every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28)   and during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every   4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.   As it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that   though I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she   mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13   weeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had   an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no   problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain   in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very   difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or   move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for   when I do need to go out.)     Anyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from   the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about   2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.    (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating   very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well   now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile   related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my   upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I   was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because   it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt    no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I   ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had   turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if   I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it   wasn't as much of a problem.    So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid   fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware   of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have   been avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat   foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.      But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat   except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,   fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I   should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only   have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (   potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in   a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or   steamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have   some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if   I'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it   from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if   she's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her   recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on   cholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She   originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the   entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I   started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and   she's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also   asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them   are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,   and feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did   want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be   temporary for that one week.     What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I   would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying   that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she   assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that   because of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to   use the energy from the food I do eat.     Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm   truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet   because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few   minutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I   don't find any foods satisfying.    Thanks     G "

It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this  whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most  difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the  average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If  there is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will  provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is  too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their  own or buy a cheaper one.  I give SCT my full support, and hope the  Clipper chip goes the way of the Beta video tape format.    Also hope they get sued over re-using the name Clipper.    --    ---------------------------------------Cyberspace:--------------------------  | David T.

Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years.  The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about  how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and  the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light  shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences,  and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that  the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever  something was wanted, it was smuggled in.         If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced  years before.           Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.  Canada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited  in the U.S.    >Hell, here in Britain, the cops don't even carry guns.

According to U.S. News & World Report, British handgun deaths have  risen over 250% over the past twelve years.  The U.S. number has dropped  5%.           Maybe they're smuggling them across the U.S./U.K. border.  Yeah,  that's the ticket.    >CYA!           Have a nice day, Steve.

Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!        James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of      being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost      every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to      which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers      are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of      ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government      of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military      establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are      carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments      are afraid to trust the people with arms.""                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^        James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right      of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A      well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free      country...""        Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of      the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with      respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it      will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of      a year.""        Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing      armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the      government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be      formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large      body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****      own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.""      ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they  said ""people"", right?

Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist  Papers?!         James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General      Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first      to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a      recital of particulars.""    But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He  only wrote it.    > The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with   > the security of a free state.  The Federalist Paper's mention of a  > well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects  > the security of a free state.  All these examples are actions of a  > very organized force, not some John Q. Public with a gun.    That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist  Papers.     > All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me is that the people's  > right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed.  That is   > people have the right to join a well organized militia.  This well  > organized militia will, of course, provide training in how to use arms  > and in basic military tactics.  These training members of the militia  > can keep and bear the arms.    Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says ""well organized  militia"".     > Lastly, reading through the Federalist Paper's on well organized   > militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias.  > One reason stated is the protection from a standing army.  These days  > the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every   > 17-45 year old male and female not in the armied forces.    That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any*  weapon currently in use in the armed forces.    > Another  > reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need  > for a standing army.

Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This      country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit      it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,      they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or      their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.""        Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate      over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August      1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the      establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...      Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of      the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order      to raise an army upon their ruins.""

I tried Prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no  anxiety or jitters.  I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the  Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe  because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a  20mg dose didn't work.    Now I'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on Zoloft (another serotonin  reuptake inhibitor like Prozac).  One pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some.   Now I'm trying 100mg/day.  Zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than  Prozac.  I think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking Zoloft  have to discontinue it because of side effects.  The only problem I'm  having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the  Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.    My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin  drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many  side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.  If the serotonin drugs don't work  at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.    >...suggestions as to the next step?    Having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big  difference.  My psychiatrist claims that most GPs and FPs don't have much  experience in this area, and from what I've seen I'm inclined to believe  him.  I think I know more about antidepressants than the people at my  family practitioner's office.

Fordham)          The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is   extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal   infection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the   Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted   2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed   invasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The    orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive   for HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing,   representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon   performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were   tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All   patients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent    assay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.    The examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect   cases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of   the initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single   most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37   percent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were   conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who   was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.    Notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive   and expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \          =================================================================       ""Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-  Infected Surgeon"" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol.     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993    269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.)          The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be   quantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar   investigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins   University School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a   total of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical    procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was   listed as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for   all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were   obtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413   had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No   study patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly   detected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably   infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369   person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to   patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours   of surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to    suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control   guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to   be tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was   found to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably   the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,    there is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive   surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.         ==================================================================                                  April 20, 1993         ==================================================================   ""Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data"" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10    (Kolata, Gina)          A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly   unusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are   undergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the   Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He   said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it   had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective   in fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that   HIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at   different sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the   mutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one   after the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies   do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new   agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data   on new AIDS drugs.  ""An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993    companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a   much more  efficient way,"" said Scolnick.  He also said that the    collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement,   Merck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.    Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute   of Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, ""We're delighted to see the    pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the   information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for   AIDS.""

AZT has been used in the United  States in asymptomatic HIV-positive people on   the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of    T-cell counts.  However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should   not be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877   people given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving   only placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the   proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to   death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The    conclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected   individuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the   progression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study   of the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already   appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the    evidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has   proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV   infection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the   beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of   disease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself   provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes    Maddox.         ==================================================================   ""Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected   Women"" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe   et al.)          A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM   type in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of   HIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993    National AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized   that  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the    presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in   breastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were   enrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6   months, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were   assayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with    protein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral   genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of   primers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post   partum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97   percent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent;   and IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived   longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of   persistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-  infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of   HIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.    The  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM   response was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in   breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers   conclude.         ==================================================================                                      April 21, 1993         ==================================================================      ""Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture"" Journal of Commerce   (04/21/93), P. 7A          A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced   Tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS   research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV   infection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily   from the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies   since  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual   AIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories,   led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come   together, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies   involved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche,   Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck,   Syntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The   participants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they   were aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively    involved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.  Scolnick said the   collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong   scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41  Volume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993    and early clinical data.  The  American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR)   was pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to   the  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.

Following recent  highly publicized reports of   health professionals who contracted  HIV, the department issued revised   guidelines on the management  of such cases.  Dr. Kenneth Calman, Chief   Medical Officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care   workers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to HIV    infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic HIV testing.

EDT    	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that   Octavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today   about why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to   get a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature   of learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of   people like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of   those who are here.    	       	     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education   and all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my   good friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and   all of the business and local community leaders from the city and   county and state level from around America who are here.   	       	     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved   hearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is   their future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A   year and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because   I was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our   country, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had   too little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines   of income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to   take us into the future.    	       	     I entered with the hope that together we could create   more opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of   our people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of   America's community, knowing that together we could always to more   than we could individually and that we might secure our future.  	       	     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000   jobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the   commitments made by many of the private sector people who are here,   and those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs   does, and the successes of all the young people like those on this   stage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all   those things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're   on the right track.  	       	     Last July when I was traveling across America's   heartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in   Louisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business   people who were participating in the Louisville Education and   Employment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.    I saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed   both in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my   own state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about   -- that for millions of American young people it is really an   impediment to both their learning and their ability to be good   workers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what   is learning.  	       	     In the world in which we are living, the average young   person will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a   lifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning   world much better.  And we must determine that all of our young   people see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased   here today.    	       	     Whether you're in business or in government or in   education, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to   building a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all   of our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things   are pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best   thing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have   jobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)    	       	     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty   good education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that   they'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either   political or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great   challenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to   fully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work   for them to do.  	       	     All the European countries have higher unemployment   rates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the   unemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.    They're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its   most rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that   I have proposed to create jobs.   	       	     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now   about as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.    It costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of   pressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing   their own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their   people.    	       	     But it is especially important for America for two   reasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move   aggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be   competitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is,   even if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed   of the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to   work in this country.  (Applause.)  	       	     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some   of it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and   moving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We   have now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big   organizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they   are organized and who ask whether there are too many people working   at some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to   create jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the   chance to work.    	       	     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare   reform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of   months -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the   end of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.    (Applause.)  	       	     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of   the American people to perform without regard to race or income or   the circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that   there are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their   talent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.    I do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if   you want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more   responsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this   country that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you   have got to have opportunity in that mix.   	       	     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for   every young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules   and work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be   something at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are   basically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners,   recognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of   our people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their   background.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's   something there for them to do?    	     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an   integral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of   work and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people   first, and it does have a partnership between the public and private   sector.  	       	     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in   February on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000   extra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the   American business community to meet that target so that we can create    more than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been   created before.  	       	     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And   Jerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in   this room and around the country -- people who are going to do more   than they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people   a work experience.  And it is terribly important.  	       	     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is   part of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the   American people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their   jobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving   the transition from school to work for young people who don't go to   college but do need at least two years of post-high school training   either on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting,   so that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more   people to go on to college who do want to go.  	       	     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive   plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The   emergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would   create a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and   that would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It   would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work   force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.  	       	      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to   invest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --  projects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects,   new industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities   -- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve   the environment.    	       	     The summer jobs program is an important part of that   because we have tried for the first time, through the work of the   Labor Department and the Education Department and through reaching   out to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer   jobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to   hopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young   people into further educational opportunities and to further job   opportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component   to these summer jobs -- something that the United States government   has never fully emphasized before.    	       	     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because   they come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in   difficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building   their basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other   areas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who   have difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what   they learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next   year.    	       	     What we are trying to do here is to give people the   opportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning   skills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next   couple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school   in this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning   environment.    	       	     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities   for people to learn and work during the school year, so that this   will not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will   be a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new   work experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.  	       	     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-  work jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding   the job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help   to build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve   local problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public   buildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in   hospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers,   and learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while   they earn, but letting them earn.  	       	     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people   who have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should   do this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the   opportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing   in going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't   exactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare   system; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people   to work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the   use of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if   you're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to   reward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.    (Applause.)  	       	     The young people we propose to put to work under our   program will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math,   reading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will   stretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a   sense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge,   but a challenge that will take them into a different life.  	       	     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even   as I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the   summer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll   see whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer   academically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved   ahead.  I suspect that they will.    	       	     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I   will be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn   from you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next   summer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school   year, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that   we do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so   that we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private   investments as well.   	       	     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the   business leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this   summer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business   who have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who   haven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about   this event today, I want to implore other private employers to   stretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this   summer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when   we don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort   them to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)  	       	     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up   here on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking   about work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've   done to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very   foolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand   and sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had   ever had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be   worth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)  	       	     That does not mean young people should not be   entrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation   ahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and   worked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.    And I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some   people say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)    	       	     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I   grew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul   without regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a   job.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to   people is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a   job and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now   I live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any   more money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're   working longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.    And we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these   young people want.  	       	     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:    It doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration   pursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private   sector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn   how to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created   in this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done   off-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a   third or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do   economically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of   America's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just   kidding.    	       	     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy   country in the world, including the United States, is having   difficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done   I'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole   deliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the   answers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.    (Applause.)  	       	     And so the jobs program that I have presented to   Congress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the   counties, through the Community Development Program, with the   infrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an   attempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the   economy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little   boost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a   million jobs and maybe get the engine going again.  	       	     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in   the private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government   money.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American   economy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind   of system we have and it works pretty well.    	       	     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you   here today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends   and neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers   to make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the   funds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government   should create this summer, so that together we can have this   partnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a   future -- a future that our young people can believe in.    	       	     We need to send them a message that here in America if   you study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute   something to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.    You can build a future from you own dreams.   	       	     That has always been the promise of America.  Together   that's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of   the promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise   has been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.  	       	     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)                                     END11:45 A.M. EDT       "

Blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration  rate for violent crimes.    So I doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism  present.    There is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.    Interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the Southern  United States -- where blacks are incarcerated well BELOW the average in  the rest of the United States! Which points to an anti-bias-against wrt  blacks.    In any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are  reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).    Considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and  some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a  situation where (if I remember my old calculations right) 4% of the  population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.    Blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,  except in the South, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!        --   There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of  environmental disaster. Weird, eh?    These opinions are MINE, and you can't have 'em! (But I'll rent 'em cheap ...) "

2,"Distribution: world  Message-ID: <Cohen-270493073219@q5022531.mdc.com>  NNTP-Posting-Host: q5022531.mdc.com    The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,  but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....    Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,  based on information provided by NASA headquarters.    The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the  Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The  day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics  covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for  the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the  assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management  options and operations concepts also were held.    The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:    ¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest  said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has  identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended  and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed  to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable  capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified  Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing  systems such as the so-called ""Bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and Spacelab.    The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom  photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab  missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.    Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.  Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking  ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter  docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different  operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.    ¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option  B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,  from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent  Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent  Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the  baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking  system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data  Management System.    Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree  inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration  orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic  arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.    Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss  segments and the U.S. lab.    Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two  orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.    Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other  section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and  propulsion systems.    The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete  state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,  a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete  the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.    Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware  would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived  option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including  program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and  operations costs, he said.    ¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,  the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid  rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle  main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch  and jettisoned after ET separation.    The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000  cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a  centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various  places on the circumference of the module to place the international  modules, and other elements.  This ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic  arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial  attitude.    In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor  said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so  that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the  Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.    Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space  experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members  of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space  Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA.   Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,  the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team  briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking  systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the  Soyuz TM spacecraft.    The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities  of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian  capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will  be available to the SRT through May 5.    Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT  subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to  develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a  foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various  management options have been developed including:    ¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of  command.    ¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate  Administrator.    ¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located  hand-picked program office.    ¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an  element of the current program.    ¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and  geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.    The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the  Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had  already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its  preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.    As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency  experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of  assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing  and ground operations.    What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a  comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday  and Tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the  detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing  for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to  be held May 3.    Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the  Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the  activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant  deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve  as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to  consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request  from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.    Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being  carried on the schedule are:    April 26  Design Freeze on Options for Costing    April 27  Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT    May 3  Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee    May 15  Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee    June 7  Final report to Redesign Advisory Committee      (Oct. 31-cancellation .....just my opinion...AC)    "

The reasons are pragmatic: even if  >Bosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under  >Turkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any  >clue what was their ancestor's actual nationality.  In fact, although    I am forced to disagree with you. First of all, one may have been   born from a non-Turkish, non-Muslim parent outside the Turkish land,   yet still can be a Turk, provided this person calls himself or herself   a Turk. Because the designation of a Turk is not a genetic feature,  not a racial or religious feature. It is a matter of identifying  with the Turkish values. Secondly, the following observations by   Westerners were written in French by Ahmet Cevat:     ""If Turks had behaved like Christians to use force to convert to Islam the  nations which they brought under their power, to which no one could have  opposed, today there would be no Eastern problem. But Turks did not do so.   They obeyed the word of the Koran to permit everybody ""to worship in their own  way"" centuries before Frederick the Great pronounced his famous dictum. Thus,  in an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when   people in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs  differed from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the  inquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and   where accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey  was the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere  by the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim  countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian  countries.""[1]    ""The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came  under their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It  was a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of  Russian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a  Romanian nation today"" (Popescu Ciocanel).    ""Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without  interfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy  of minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most  advanced European countries.""[2]    ""...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw  is older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples  of this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account  of his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of  simple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into  action, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves  happy!"" (A. de Mortraye).[3]    ""Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the  inquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate  victims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that  in the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and  Portugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been  living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,  and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the  cruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to  appear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,  however, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,  local courts immediately take them under their protection.""    ""In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are  living together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and  the synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is  more free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition   to the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this   sect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the  dead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional  candles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in  the Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical  processions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing  their crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them  which forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of   priests.""

Human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  That means  third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  In consulting  a 1989 World Almanac, I see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at   21 weeks or more.  That's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.  Unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or  a LOT of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, I think you are  wrong.    By the way, Roe v. Wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad  prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as  California, declined to do so.  It was reported* that what finally   stopped third trimester elective abortions in the Bay Area wasn't law,   but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,  willing to do them.  Not surprisingly, the bay area NOW chapter was  terribly upset about this.

2,"  Ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year.  It is still  partially frozen, and I am still in physical therapy every week.  But the  pain has subsided almost completely.  UNTIL last week when I mowed the  lawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row.  I have a push type power  mower.  The pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite  a while, and I used ice and medicine again.  Can anybody explain why this  particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally,  should cause this shoulder problem?    Thanks.    Alice "
2,"  Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup   several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, ""How to improve your  sight - simple daily drills in relaxation"", by Margaret D. Corbett,   ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It   talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been  any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by   actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing   the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the   too-long eyeball?    Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most  logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,  i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been  any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by   changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of   eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the   eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's   idea, right?)    Thanks for any information.     "

As John Gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the  infrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that  is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of  attitude on the part of the government.    Our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to  ensure freedom in our country. They designed the system to make it  difficult for tyranny to arise. For instance, one of the reasons the  fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the  government to try to make smuggling a crime. Think I jest? John  Hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.    Think about it. The government has everyones keys in escrow, and the  FBI gets their pet ""wiretap without leaving the office"" scheme. There  is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. Within hours,  everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being  monitored more closely than ever before possible.    Without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. With tools  like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be  successfully imposed.    Why give the government tools with which to enslave you? Maybe you can  trust Bill Clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust  EVERY government that will ever arise in the U.S. hereafter? I am not  willing to make that leap of faith.    >>-Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime  >                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  >	Isn't this just a little melodramatic?    I'm a political dissident. As such, I am acutely aware of what happens  to political dissidents in most of the world. In most of the world, I  could be killed for my beliefs.

All that seperates the U.S. from most of those places is a thin piece  of parchment in the National Archives thats being constantly more and  more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. Coups have happened in  countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years.  Governments throughout history have fallen. No government has lasted  for more than a few hundred years. Often, they are replaced by  dictatorships. Do you really believe so intensely that it could never  ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and  the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?    If we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we  make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because  if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually  stick.     Naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where  hundreds that have gone before have failed. Thriving democracies led  by men far more skillfull than Bill Clinton have fallen to  dictatorship. Rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled  men before they became a tyranny.    I, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here.

""The Astronomy of Birr Castle"" was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on  the committee which is going to restore the telescope. (The remains are on  public display all year round - the massive support walls, the 60 foot long  tube, and other bits and pieces). This book is the definitivie history of  how one man, the Third Earl of Rosse, pulled off the most impressive  technical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and  the discoveries made with the instrument.    Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore  the telescope. Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by  mail order. It's a fascinating read and by ordering a copy you bring the day  when we can all look through it once again that little bit nearer.    =====ORDERING INFORMATION=====  ""The Astronomy of Birr Castle"" Dr. Patrick Moore, xii, 90pp, 208mm x 145mm.

Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel  the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course,  this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has  to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the  earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require  some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.  And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).  And the  physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our  blood, among other things).

Big difference.     That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution     to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well     known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)     are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...    Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right  energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation  with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting  all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of  baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a  plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating  enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it  happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to  make tight-binaries of neutron stars.    Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a  neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but  that uses pretty far-out physics.    My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so  GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't  rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which  converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black  holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets  aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which  modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these  mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the ""Tunguska Meteorite""  was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely  to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet  collisions matches the GRB rate well.    The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort  cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them  out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the  right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible  to match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the  wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-  cloud GRB's at all.    Executive summary: we don't know enough to rule out out the Oort  cloud. "
2,"   ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!      This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,   ether sucking structures, AND why we observe ""orbital"" motion!!      Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic   waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the   Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.       I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact   that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the   earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption   that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)      The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the   development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications   of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!      REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!        1    I dream like this: ether based reality       The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations   start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices  both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,   converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.   (non-spinning lattice = ""dark matter"")      The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image   of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us   being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by   the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is   spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner   kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a   faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground   of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but   its ""foot print"" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])        The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self   spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is   itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the   wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The ""orbit"" of the  earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around  by the sun's ether feild.      The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and ""distance""   apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because   the ""path"" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like   sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half   turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has   got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to   the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a ""j"" hook at   the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the   whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.       With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon   can be about as big as ""earth's"" shadow upon it, and at other times   totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,   would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they   look about the same size?       O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S   E       /     \                  M    |      |      OR                M               \ _ _ /                                  S                                        The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate  of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating ""turntable view""   of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a   half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the   day. Try and draw that ""earth shadow."") Its only the moon's image   which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is   the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away   from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.      ""Light-Years"" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is   closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase   of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.   (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be   essentially happening now. The ""piece"" of light may have experienced   many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.      To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to   de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design   a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like   trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)      To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd   look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just   might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the   spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+   billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG   backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card   for Pentium!)      Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound   media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I   would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which   I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.   [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a   two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I   could get with my machine's receiver next to it.        If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT   PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of   life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our   thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By   eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant   instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or   biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what   they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we   don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and   that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where   did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it   is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then   die)      Warning about writing to the past:  I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel   future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.   There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an   Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,   and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the   others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by   ""advising"" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into   reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that   the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to   provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it   in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his   control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying   that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve   souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was   finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in   our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it   seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then   some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no   more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped   through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that   he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,   existing only on the wind.       MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls   whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat   others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a   lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for   playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)      Accepting rides to the past:  Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a   Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go   ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.   I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes   your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross   paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own   course of history, none the wiser.      As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped   back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still   make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with   every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which   loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.   But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had   to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand   to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.       How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,   our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:   Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to   congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks   are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big   corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the   banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but   mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14   hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time   to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If   we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if   the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?       In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, ""its chaos!"" They   said, ""no, its order."" He defined chaos as that which is he was not   able to control.      Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy   would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no   language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)  (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and   pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably   naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should   be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.   They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers   might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a   different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.      Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a   huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat   only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and   need a lot less sleep.      UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The   troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill   each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)      Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot   tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they   suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that   they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.       Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women   and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut   from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think   that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as   mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples   of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.      That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He   tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which   the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll   play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll   whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to   live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was   right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go   back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over   your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality   in which you don't want to be a part of.       I don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just   that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path. Maybe these   thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.          "

Directly I mean...    In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a  project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in  hassles.    The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to  the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically  down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any  new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --  the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,  you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns  and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.    The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for  more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.  For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop  a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper  might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less  ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing  sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting  money in a big way.    Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a  minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which  dominates the cost of the project.  --   All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                      - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry "

What the supply must do,  if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the  supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal  one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we  should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm   resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by  necessity, must be 1V.    The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves  a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output   power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.    So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?    Thanks in advance.    Andy Collins, KC6YEY  acollins@uclink.berkeley.edu    ps: If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project, I agree fully,      but I still have to do it, its graded ;^)   "

The idea of 'sorting it out in court later' is fine, but one  has to GET TO COURT IN ONE PIECE to do that.  Korash had good reason  to think that he was not going to get that chance.

He heard SOME KIND OF EXPLOSIVES go off, he saw he was being  ATTACKED with no overt action from him (yet).  He could no more say 'oh,  its ok, its only stun grenades' anymore than I could.  He slammed the door at  that point and proceeded to repel the attackers.  He felt in genuine fear  of his life - I know I would be in fear of MY life at that point.  Have  you ever been shot at?  How clear and logically could you think, under  that pressure, when you MIGHT have ALL OF 1 or 2 SECONDS to evaluate  what is going on?  And, it would not be the first time that 'law  enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally.  For  all we know, he was informed by someone saying something like ""Hey,  guy, the BATF is coming like gangbusters, and they mean to WASTE you...""    According to the latest news, the released warrant (so we are told) said  the reason for this WW III raid was that Korash's group had spent around  $200,000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period).  Now, even assuming that the figure isn't calculated like the Feds do a  drug siezure, for 90 people, that isn't really all that much (you priced  decent guns lately?).  Hell, I can think of a person right now that probably  has that much for ONE INDIVIDUAL, mostly machineguns!!!  Sure, he is  an avid collector, but unless a new law has been passed, it is NOT illegal,  nor an indication of anything illegal, to have a lot of guns.  Also note  that the warrant had NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT MACHINE GUNS.  So, what  is the justification of this cowboy raid, other than a romp gone bad  for some anti-gun media hype, to support Clinton's push for disarming  the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons?  This administration has only one thing in mind.  CONTROL.  PEOPLE CONTROL.  Whether it is gun control, Clinton Cripple Chip, National smart ID cards,  it all boils down to PEOPLE CONTROL.

They got tipped off that the  <BATF was on the way in, and rather than adopting a non-violent,  <non-threatening posture to greet the BATF, they decided to fight.    And BATF knew the BDs were expecting them (via 60 minutes report).  But  they decided they were so big, so bad, they would have a cakewalk at  the BDs expense, for a nice media show anyway.  But it all turned to  shit, and the FBI taking over to manage things, we see it all turned to  shit, too.  Clinton says 'I am taking full responsibility'...  BAH.  Responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong.  Bet  you NOBODY pays any serious repercussions.  'Responsibility' only has  meaning as media PR, or as a means to corner the average Joe Schmoe.  Figure it out... Clinton, Reno, the FBI and BATF, will all be IMMUNE.

2,"      A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result of  trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is under  control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.    Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but  isn't helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but  this isn't helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend  has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the  effects of the combined drugs aren't supposed to be realized for several months.    As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in  one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that  tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of  the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is  quite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment  to relieve it.    The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is  now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some  of the pain from the tendonitis.    My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he's 80 (his words, not mine).      If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative  courses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely  grateful if you could e-mail to me.  If anyone is interested, I'll post a  summary to this newsgroup.    thanks in advance,  Donna  dmp@fig.citib.com "

I'd bet cash 90% of the people couldn't find the window after six  minutes!  Ask anybody who's taken basic training in the military.

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.    Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges.  They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.  The COULD and DID  impound his weapons for the duration.  And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED.    Note that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters, not  federal.  The state COULD and DID handle them properly and peaceably,  and furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process.

We are presented with  horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.  We are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get  in our government run hospitals.  We are just now seeing stories about  how Social Security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that  should come as any surprise).

No one answered me . . .                        |     |                                                                     |     +---------------------------------------------------------------------+    DEPOSITION OF EMMA SETRAKOVNA SARGISIAN       Born 1933     Cook     Sumgait Emergency Hospital       Resident at Building 16/13, Apartment 14     Block 5     Sumgait [Azerbaijan]      To this day I can't understand why my husband, an older man, was killed. What   was he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't   have. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from   the government--why my husband was killed.    On the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.  He doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, ""Mamma, is   there a soccer game?"" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we   lived. I say, ""I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV."" He looked   again and said, ""Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!"" I look and see so   many people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands,   you can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, ""Down with the   Armenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!"" My God, why is   that happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together  well, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely   unexpected. And they were shouting, ""Long live Turkey!"" And they had flags,  and they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's   around 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I   can't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,  and the children behind him are shouting, ""Tear the Armenians to pieces!"" and   ""Down with the Armenians!"" They shout it again, and then shout, ""Hurrah!"" The   people streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I   saw that there were women, too. I say, ""My God, there are women there too!""   And my son says, ""Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women."" Well we   didn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I   simply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani   neighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, ""Khalida, what's going on, what   happened?"" She says, ""Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what   happened."" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks,   each second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their   heads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white  stick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I   don't know.    My husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, ""Oh   dear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet."" And he says, ""What are   you afraid of, they're just children."" I say, ""Everything that happens comes   from children."" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and   Vocational School. ""Don't fear,"" he said, ""it's nothing, nothing all that   bad."" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they  broadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran.   When I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and   there and I said, ""They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to   kill us."" And he says, ""Don't be afraid."" Then we heard--from the central   square, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting  different things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, ""You speak  Azerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying."" He says ""Close the window  and go to bed, there s nothing happening there."" He listened a bit and then   closed the window and went to bed, and told us, ""Come on, go to sleep, it's  nothing."" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window  until two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was  affecting him. I say, ""Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute  too."" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed.   Things had calmed down slightly.    The 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, ""Come on, Emma,   get up."" I say, ""Today's my day off, let me rest."" He says, ""Aren't you going   to make me some tea?"" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, ""Where are   you going?"" He says, ""I'm going out, I have to."" I say, ""Can you really go   outside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to  me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take   the car out of the garage, go without the car."" And he says, ""Come on, close   the door!"" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it  out, he probably said ""coward"" or something.    I closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up  around the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-  noon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,  ""Khalida, was it our car?"" She says, ""No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they  were government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,  it was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I  said, ""Oh, they've killed Shagen!""    Tires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm   standing on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God,   they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten   o'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten  o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,  and from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside.   I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I   don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see   it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. ""Mamma,"" he says,  ""look what they're doing over there!"" They were burning everything, and there   were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing   on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are   throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony   is shouting, ""What are you standing there for, burn it!"" When they threw the   television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out   on her balcony and shouted, ""Why are you doing that, why are you burning those  things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their   home. Why are you burning them?"" And from the courtyard they yell at her, ""Go   inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in   your building or not?"" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians,   they said, ""of them."" She says, ""No, no, no, none!"" Then she ran downstairs to  our place, and says, ""Emma, Emma, you have to leave!"" I say, ""They've killed  Shagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without   Shagen. Let them kill us, too!"" She insists, saying, ""Emma, get out of here,   go to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my   daughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone."" I gave her the key   and went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, ""Igor, you stay   here, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.""    Meanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and   Valery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in   the courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling,   and I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived  in the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw  an Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, ""Madar,   Uncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the   garage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. ""He shouts, ""Aunt   Emma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for   him."" I say, ""Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar,   I'm coming too."" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, ""You stay   here with us, I'm go look."" He went and looked, and came back and said, ""Aunt   Emma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. ""Madar went off again and   then returned and said, ""Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's   there . . . wheezing.""    Madar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, ""Don't go near him,   or we'll put you next to him."" He got scared--he's young--and came back and   said, ""I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take   Alik, maybe he'll live . . . "" They grew up together in our courtyard, they   knew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but  not a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and   called, and called, and called--nothing.    I went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, ""Two police cars drove up over   there, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still   lying where they were, they're still lying there . . . ""We watched out the  window until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't  take my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six  o'clock in the morning I got up and said, ""Igor, you stay here at home, don't  go out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or  alive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.""    At six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another   doctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, ""Doctor, is   Shagen there?"" He says, ""What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!"" I   wanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,  they said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They  said, ""Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.""    It's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck  with three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with  them. I say, ""Sara Baji [""Sister"" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've  probably brought Shagen."" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back  and says, ""No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person."" Now Shagen   just happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they   said it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, ""Doctor, they've   brought Shagen in dead."" He says, ""Why are you carrying on like that, dead,   dead . . . he's alive."" But then he went all the same, and when he came back   the look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They  knew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, ""Doctor,   is it Shagen?"" He says, ""No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.""   I say, ""Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway,   if not today, then tomorrow."" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the  office. He says, ""Emma, go, go calm down a little."" Another one of our   colleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous   condition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes   later another colleague comes in and says, ""Oh, poor Emma!"" When she said it   like that there was no hope left.       That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured   people.    At night someone took me home. I said, ""Igor, Papa's been killed.""    On the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital:   I had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is   surrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. ""Hey, citizen, where   are you going?"" I say, ""I work here,"" and from inside someone shouts, ""Yes,   yes, that's our cook, let her in."" I went right to the head doctor's office  and there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to  work with us at the hospital. He says, ""Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.  In the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku."" I  say, ""Doctor, how will I bury him?"" He says, ""We're taking care of all that,  don't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you  spend the night?"" I say, ""I was at home."" He says, ""What do you mean you  were at home?! You were at home alone?"" I say, ""No, Igor was there too."" He  says, ""You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just  one second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right  now, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here  like a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...""  His last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli  Sadukhov.    The ""ambulance"" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a   patient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the   hospital until the 4th.    Some police car came and they said, ""Emma, let's go."" And the women, our   colleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, ""Where are   you taking her?"" I say, ""They're going to kill me, too . . . "" And the  investigator says, ""Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive  identification."" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I  still can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, ""Let's   go, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen."" And when I saw the caskets,  lying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, ""I can't look, no.""  The investigator says, ""Are there any identifying marks?"" I say, ""Let me see  the clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them."" He says,   ""Isn't they're anything on his body?"" I say he has seven gold teeth and his   finger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had  been injured at work . . .    They brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they   brought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, ""Oh,   they burned him!"" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat   down, I don't remember. And that investigator says, ""Well fine, fine, since   we've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since  he has seven gold teeth . . . ""    On the 4th they told me: ""Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now."" I cried, ""How,   how can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform   his relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself."" They say, ""OK,   you know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they   get here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.""    He was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in   Sumgait. They asked me, ""Where do you want to bury him?"" I said, ""I want to   bury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,"" I'm   shouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, ""Do you know what   it means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!"" I say, ""What do you mean,   arson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that  they killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone   anymore."" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He  says, ""Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year,   if it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . ""    Our trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the  investigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then  at the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime.   Then they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said,   ""Ismailov, look, is that you?"" He says, ""Yes."" ""Well look, here you're   describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?"" He says,   ""Yes."" ""And now you're telling it differently?"" He says, ""Well maybe I   forgot!"" Like that.    The witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going  along Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a   Volga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were   involved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear  who--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side  of the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports   jacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, ""What's your nationality?"" He   says, ""Armenian."" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, ""If he's an  Armenian, kill him, kill him!"" They started beating him, they broke seven of  his ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too   . . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he   had an armature shaft. He says, ""I picked it up, it was lying near a bush,   that's where I got it."" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he  had already had it. He said, ""I hit him twice,"" he said, "" . . . once or twice  on the head with that rod."" And he said that when he started to beat him   Shagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said,   ""I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,  killing someone,"" he says, ""and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or  not?"" I said, ""You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you  came back to hit him again?"" He went back and looked and he was already dead.  ""After that,"" that bastard Tale said, ""after that I went home.""    I said, ""You . . . you . . . little snake,"" I said, ""Are you a thief and a   murderer?"" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They  were taken. He says he didn't take them    When they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was  other people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned  it, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, ""How can you   have the trial when you don't know who burned the car?"" He said something, but  I didn't get what he was saying. But I said, ""You still haven't straightened   everything out, I think that's unjust.""    When they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him.   In the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80  percent of his body . . .    And I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good   craftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his   own hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the   time. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the   Army. And now they're fatherless...    I couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15  years' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't  know what to do with myself, I said, ""How can that be? You,"" I said, ""you are   saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years'   deprivation of freedom?"" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, ""Let me at that  creep, with my bare hands I'll . . . "" A relative restrained me, and there  were all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,"" This isn't a   Soviet trial, this is unjust!"" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .    I said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street,   they were shouting, ""Long live Turkey!"" and ""Glory to Turkey!"" And during the   trial I said to that Ismailov, ""What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?"" I   still don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet   Union. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still  don't understand why ""Glory to Turkey!"" I asked that question twice and got no  answer . . . No one answered me . . .

Geez Allen any  organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate  costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support  a program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap  was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you  say is not true.

Apollo integration was   done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of  Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are  completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There  is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project  that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for   Apollo?    >Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs.

I agree that JSC screwed up big.  They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it  replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your  bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just  how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what  they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.     >>Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is  >>at a place where everything is overhead.  >   >When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that  >integration isn't overhead.

What I completly disagree with is seperating that  integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called  leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for  the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership  and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up  as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC  and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to  finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the  process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.    There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that  for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the  turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is  lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of  leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a  symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your  efforts that you do not see this.    >>Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally  >>demanded change that caused the problems?

The team which was later to prosecute him on  criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's  immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at  least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it  was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the  reasons this ON is still walking around free today.

In case you don't know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my  knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic  object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns  or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type  of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might  extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within  the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.      --   _D_I_S_C_L_A_I_M_E_R_: I can neither confirm nor deny any opinions  expressed in this article directly reflect my own personal or  political views and furthermore, if they did, I would not be at  liberty to yield such an explanation of these alleged opinions.

2,"  In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid  rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on  a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid  motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of   aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent  Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.  The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect  some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made  a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what  you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in  all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into  the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The  foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,  so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major  improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the  principal failure mode for solid propellant.

Getting a flushed  face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular  pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in  the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are  sodium compounds.

They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious  compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible  some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the  symptoms. But it's important to remember that a lot opf these effets  can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be  necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person  was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration  and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from  simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.     > some  >had itchy skin or rashes.     People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends  upon what it is about the compound that ""pisses off"" their body.  Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many  people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an  histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,  causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an  allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that  contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can  perturb that person's system as much as inhaling it.     >More serious accusations include respiration   >difficulty     See above. And don't think that heart rate changes, and circulatory  problems are not serious. They can be deadly.    and brain damage.     The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system  controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling  the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,  and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.      >Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one  >suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food  poisoning.     Absolutely. But it could also be some synergystic mess from eating ,  say, undetected shrimp or mushrooms (to which many are allergic), plus  too much alcohol, and inhaling too much diesel fumes biking home,  plus, let's say, having contracted flu from one's sig. other 3 days  before from drinking out of the same glass.

Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages  count as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them?  January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold                 1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,                      after cutting off the supply lines to it.  Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi.  By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from        land links with the rest of the Jewish population.           The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,              while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were              slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.  Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from       Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side       of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews        had been killed.    Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.  Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets  against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?  Will it still be 'Intifadah' when the PLO brings in tanks?      >--   >Joseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades,  >jaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief.  >Disclaimer?

There may be an  article in the IBM Systems Journal Late '93, early '94.    There is no magic formula.  We did it with dedicated and disciplined  folks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors  and is corrected based on errors that ""escape"".  We present a  one day overview of our process periodically to interested folks.  The next one is May 19th in Washington, D.C.  I can fax specifics  to those who are interested.

Putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing.   Coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in   its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  Any misalignment of the   plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will   require more fuel to adjust.  This was considered in the original deployment.     I agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous.    One has to admire how much they are trying to do.     Wm. Hathaway   Baltimore MD  "

""mothership"" except  for Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a  ""Grand Tour"" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt   that  the idea of a big ""mother ship"" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather  small, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan  III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in  common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a  probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several  smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.  The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards  Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful  cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power  source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.  Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements  within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a  relatively great distance.  ---  The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers,  and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in  the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during  the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the  same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in  addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining  that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have  enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several  other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune  systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to  trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space  probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a   small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy,   well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer  planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of  course.

This is, of course, assuming that the program uses something in ROM (like    the BIOS serial number, maybe?) and not a disk-based code number.     Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.    I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.     We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred    machines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of    over 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab    with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with    admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more    than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of    your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.     ""Pirate board"" or no pirate board.  I too have ""friends"" who blatantly and    quite successfuly ""hack"" copy protection schemes practically in their    sleep.    Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one    machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some    setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,    mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network    administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are    (partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and ""acting"" similar to    the average user, and maintaining ""behind-the-scenes"" consistency is a    real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty    different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his    disk.    Often we have hardware problems at peak ""business"" times and have to do    some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .    Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..    The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration    files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found    to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then    COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that    machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have    ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies    this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are    all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.    Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor    to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is    usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe    the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with ""copy    protection"" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain     . .    In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort    of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and    you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's    guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this    REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute    the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but    please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the    costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the    legitimate user with a ""copy protection"" scheme!

The only consolation is that manufacturers are  _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.

I recently evaluated  the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy  alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has  a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time  capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in  the range.

These instruments  tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement  over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our  scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these  switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the  longevity of the instruments.

Not necessarily.  For instance, in the system outlined in the May 1993  issue of ""Byte"", the process of getting one's public key listed for general  use involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies, which  do calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers of  the public key directory, which combines these results into your listed  public key.  If you try to give the escrow agencies pieces which -don't-  yield your private key when they are all put together, the result is that  the public key listed for you is wrong and you can't read messages encrypted  to you.

2,"Approved: news-answers-request@MIT.Edu  Supersedes: <astronaut_730956661@cs.unc.edu>  NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.edu    Archive-name: space/astronaut  Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $    HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT        First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA      announcement.        Q. How do I become an astronaut?        A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably      impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying      passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have      so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to      win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet      experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you      want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission      specialist"".        If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,      the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly      exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,      but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough      to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,      many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.        Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands      dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer      programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-      seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in      another seems to be a frequent winner.        Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a      radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows      what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term      effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other      significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,      you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.        Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in      appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying      to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you      are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you      will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is      a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and      proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.      Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,      and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.      Keep your nose clean.        Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;      experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.        Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,      43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were      a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).      If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job      at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you      do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".        Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance      to demonstrate motivation.        Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.              NASA      National Aeronautics and Space Administration      Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center      Houston, Texas        Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates      ==================================================================        Astronaut Candidate Program      ---------------------------        The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for      Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates      to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a      continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.        Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be      considered.        All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in      Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation      program.        Space Shuttle Program Description      ---------------------------------        The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated      that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming      routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in      the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then      returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and      flight crew.        The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment      and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation      of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials      processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will      eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space      station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher      orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space      Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include      government agencies and private industries.        The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,      and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are      assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA      astronauts.        Pilot Astronaut        Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.      During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,      crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the      commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the      pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing      the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other      payload operations.        Mission Specialist Astronaut        Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,      have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations      in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and      experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to      have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed      knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and      objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the      experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission      specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling      using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific      experimental operations.        Astronaut Candidate Program      ===========================        Basic Qualification Requirements      --------------------------------        Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to      submitting an application.

Quality of      academic preparation is important.        2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight      test experience highly desirable.        3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a      military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following      specific standards:    	 Distant visual acuity:  	      20/50 or better uncorrected  	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.    	 Blood pressure:  	      140/90 measured in sitting position.        4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.        Citizenship Requirements        Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of      the United States.        Note on Academic Requirements        Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic      education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --      specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum      in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's      degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,      biological science, physical science, or mathematics.          The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the      sciences, are not considered qualifying:        - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,  	Medical Technology, etc.)        - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological  	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).        - Degrees in Nursing.        - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)        - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.        Application Procedures      ----------------------        Civilian        The application package may be obtained by writing to:    	NASA Johnson Space Center  	Astronaut Selection Office  	ATTN: AHX  	Houston, TX 77058        Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA      decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be      given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is      made. Applications received after that date will be retained and      considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually      of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate      continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants      who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from      consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the      preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be      requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as      supervisors and references may be contacted.        Active Duty Military        Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their      respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application      procedures will be disseminated by each service.        Selection      ---------        Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required      for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.      Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered      will be notified of the outcome of the process.        Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the      selection of additional candidates during a one year period following      their establishment.        General Program Requirements        Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be      assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,      Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and      evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or      scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to      ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut      training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills      required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot      astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during      their candidate period.        Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does      not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut      will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and      evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the      training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become      permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for      a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not      selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA      depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that      time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a      specified tour of duty.        NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified      minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.      Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.        Pay and Benefits      ----------------        Civilians        Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal      Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,      and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements      and experience.        Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and      participation in group health and life insurance plans.        Military        Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center      but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and      other similar military matters.

2,"Nntp-Posting-Host: sungx2.ps    Hi.    My wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year  that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness  to gaining weight. She has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?)  tests and her values were regarded as low. The doctor (and my wife) are  not very interested in starting medication as this ""deactivates"" the   gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). The last couple of   monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given  some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the   'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,  but I haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the   brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)     My questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?  Her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the  probability of improvement? Although the doctor has told her to 'eat  normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels  that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this  affect the treatment, development?    I can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and I  will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.    I don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established  medical profession or a praise for alternatives, I am just relaying  events as they have happened.    Sincerely,    Erik A. Wolff "

Let's keep the land  >out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market.  -------------------------------------------  It's already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism  of land. Other than government land, saved for posterity and the eco-system  as well as government function, the remaining land is owned by a smaller  percentage of the people than ever before. The game of capitalism is almost  won. The game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters  into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly, or else be enslaved in  return for a place to live. Here in central California, already, fewer than  30% own all the property and 5% of them own 90% of it. That's twice what it  was twenty years ago. Rents are so high that you pay 60% of your income for  rent. If you just have a McJob, all you can afford is one room, if that.  Some 30% of minimum wage workers are homeless. Unless you both have degrees  in technical fields and are working in them, (in the midst of 30%  unemployment in high tech jobs!), you will never own anything but a used  car if you choose to have more than one child!!! And everywhere else you  could afford there are no jobs. The only way to get there is to save and  not consume any more than you have to, clothing used, food poor. No movies,  no entertainment,, ect. for about five to seven years, and then, if you've  saved $20,000, if you can get together that much, and that's ignoring your  kids and working two jobs, then you can buy a home in Arkansas or Missouri  outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year! That's an  exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other  people's houses and find a sturdy hill, then you can buy one up there! Also  buy a rowboat. Missouri's not so bad, if you like the sensation of sleeping  in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. They really  do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to  start with ether!:) Shit, kill the rich and redistribute the livable  property. Kill all of them!  -RSW    >I want people to be able to work and gain a basic subsistance and more.  >Is there a workable system for what you suggest?

Extra is kept for  the future. You get to stay where you are without paying rent. Land that  supports others becomes property of the state. Farmers are welcome to plant  crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. If  you want to grow sourgum because you always did, and you aren't doing a  good job, then we let another farmer grow sorghum, and you grow something  else. When people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the  public holdings. No one can sell land, but they can trade places with  anybody. No one can lease land. The government will locally distribute the  use of the land not used for residences. Residences that are insufficient  to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house  and yard according to need and availability. The local land council who vow  to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness  subject to review by the state and federal land councils. It will cost no  more than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a  deep dark hole to the owners! Anyone can submit a request for a larger  house or land to start a business on, depending on a valid business plan  and community needs. Heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public  good or as needed. Heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and  maintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in  service to the community. Companies who own many machines are to be divided  among the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid  operators on a need basis. Cost of upkeep is charged. A guild of heavy  machine operators is recognized for safety and training's sake. Their  council is a subcouncil to the community council. Etc. Etc. Etc. It isn't  so hard to think of a better system than we have. All you have to do is  realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct, in fact it's a  rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could  be already!!!!!!!! The trick is to realize that the old rich have been  making the rules behind your back and that it's time to kick them off the  merry-go-round. Tax the rich to death. They are the ones that converted  your 60's school lunch program into the joke it is today. They are the ones  who always cut education. They are the ones who always raise the rent when  you get a raise. They are the ones who should be not just dislodged but  killed for their abuse. I have trouble justifying the death penalty for a  poor kid who killed and didn't know why not. I have no trouble justifying  the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed  their greed! Have you paid rent most of your life? Then you have been  enslaved, percentage wise, most of your life. We used to be serfs. Now we  are called renters, and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own  land they don't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to  own it. Most rents in California are enough to buy the apartment house,  paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with!  I have seen the books! I know what my landlord pays and to whom! I know  what I pay her. I am being forced to buy her a building and then I will be  let out at the other end with nothing, when I had as much right as her to  live on this planet! And her child will have the money to likewise  enslave my child. I hope I find out when I am going to die. I can make  things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she  destroyed mine. And maybe I can take a few other landlords with me, and  their heirs. That would be worth it. Then to be able to die before they can  do anything to me. That's a poor man's dream. Sleep tight, bastard  landlords. You don't know the trouble you are buying yourself as you sleep  on my heirs money in your mattress!  -RSW    --   * Richard STEVEn Walz   rstevew@deeptht.armory.com   (408) 429-1200  *  * 515 Maple Street #1   * Without safe and free abortion women are   *  * Santa Cruz, CA 95060    organ-surrogates to unwanted parasites.*   *  * Real Men would never accept organ-slavery and will protect Women.  * "

Someone else said something similar.  I will not comment on the  value or lack of value of Elias's ""proposal"".  I just want to say  that it is very distressing that at least two people here are  profoundly ignorant of Nazi racial doctrine.  They were NOT  like Elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.      Nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  An   instructive example is the Nazi attitude to Gypsies.  According to   Nazi theoreticians, Gypsies were an Aryan race.  They were persecuted,  and in huge numbers murdered, because most European Gypies were  considered not pure Gypsies but ""mongrels"" formed from the pure Gypsy   race and other undesirable races.  This was the key difference between   the theoretical approach to Jews and Gypsies, by the way.  It is also   true that towards the end of WWII even the ""purist"" Gypsies were   hunted down as the theory was forgotten.    Brendan.  (email:  bdm@cs.anu.edu.au) "

Still covering up the crimes of your fascist Armenian grandparents   and Nazi Armenian parents? Not a chance. As early as 1934, K. S. Papazian   asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians            'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]    At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would  actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World  War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim  population of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological  tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before  the outbreak of the Second World War.    In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted  in the 'Hairenik Weekly:'     ""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall    see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations   and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to   the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are   strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.   On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is   bereft of social sanctities.""[2]    [1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press     1934), Preface.  [2] 'Hairenik Weekly,' Friday, April 10, 1936, 'The Race is our     Refuge' by O. Zarmooni.    In April 1942, Hitler was preparing for the invasion of the Caucasus.  A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German  officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian  Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.  Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his  Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the  creation of an Armenian SS formation in order     ""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the    spirit of the Nazi ideas.""    He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories  of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish  homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels  Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language  radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were  produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]    [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored  by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the  establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any   official position. His views were represented by his men in the  respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro  and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.  Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after  a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to  Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]     A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not  'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.  As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians  were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August   1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of  Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.    [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.    Need I go on?

1,"  It is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is  interested in what I actually said, I never compared the  Israeli treatment of the palestinians with the Holocaust.  Anyway that is the truth if it matters. I was about to forget  about it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic  for making the comparison that I never made. What I did say was  that the Nazis didn't start with the Holocaust and their  initial actions were similar to what the Israelis are doing now.

Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals  for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this  with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.  Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.    Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members  did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of  Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts  between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties  while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.    I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this  last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that  were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system  was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there  was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.    |> Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party  |> has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition  |> members do the same?

Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor  party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of  the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored!  Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again  due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party  works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most  political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.    And to answer your question, I ""broke"" with labor because I felt  that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox  coalition members.    |> >From ""The OTHER Front"", July 29, 1992.

My take on the matter, and I will admit to the possibility  that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument.

In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to  using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf.

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause  pregnancy, even in the presence of a hymen. I doubt that sperm could make   it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum,  but it might be possible.    So, it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant.  Also, some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near-normal intercourse  without rupturing. The problem when investigating these phenomenae is,  of course, getting an honest account of what exactly happened.    -philippe "
2,"  I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a  chance to read the news for a couple of days...    The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private  Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around  the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from  the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned  in front of the user's eye.    The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA  compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up  and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the  sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image  projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse  with the background.    I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I  looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking  if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.  The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found  annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly  used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.    I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in  the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.      --   Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department  Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511  wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED "

You're right!  Andi shouldn't be comparing  Israel to the Nazis.  The Israelis are much worse than the  Nazis ever were anyway.  The Nazis did a lot of good for  Germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the  damn Jews.  The Holocaust never happened anyway.  Ample  evidence given by George Schafer at Harvard, Dept. of History,  and even by Randolph Higgins at NYU, have shown that the  Holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain  sympathy to piush for the creation of Israel.

You may consider that I am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.  Thats quite true. I don't pretend to be. Being nice is what amateurs  try to do. If you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions  such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting  to rescue the children. Anyone who has held the office of President  of the United States since FDR has held the threat that if the USA  or its allies were to be threatened then the USA would risk nuclear   Holocaust in order to protect freedom. Beleive it or not, that is not  the sort of threat that nice chaps make. Do they have a gun nutters  section of the US version of CND by any chance?      There are cases where society has to be protected from  madmen such as Koresh or Hitler. If it were not for the consideration  of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would  not be a matter of anything but academic significance. It is not for  the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.    The latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to  leave the compound by Koresh loyalists during the fire. If proven  that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to  promote Koresh as some sort of role model or hero.      I need hardly add that it is Koresh that has created the Holocaust in  this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.        Phill Hallam-Baker "

Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never  be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no  materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids  and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low  grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,   and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat   sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military  weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space   travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as   Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor   activity in the global scope of things.    Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent  calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's  too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories  that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna  has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital  sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers  a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,  and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and  heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity  wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.    We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually  ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to  deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more  expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the  easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few  centuries, if not much longer.    Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio  astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site  of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for  defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is  unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.  The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good  enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for  conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a  bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little  ultimate profit either.

Please spread the word!  Here's some  information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay  Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to  learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have  some money available...    John Spencer, 1993/04/21    Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn  itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,  (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;         1993 May 1-2            A-ring ingress  18:27                 egress   19:30          B-ring ingress  19:51                 egress   21:42          C-ring egress   23:00          Saturn ingress  23:59                 egress   10:02          B-ring ingress  10:28                 egress   12:19          A-ring ingress  12:40                 egress   13:43         1993 July 20-21            Saturn ingress  21:16                 egress   05:08          A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)                 egress   09:38    Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,  and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'  orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from  Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about  the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy  and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell  of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my  attention.    THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?    Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:      To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July    disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,    etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,    except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3    airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with    a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something    to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.      Jay    and again:      please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet    disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would    be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and    getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a    good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't    think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are    well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One    possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.    jay         ___    _____     ___      /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov      | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |   ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand  /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and  |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

My response to the ""shooting down"" of a Turkish airplane over the Armenian  air space was because of the IGNORANT posting of the person from your   Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived  in their HOMELAND for 3000 years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS   BY STALIN) are the ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending   themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. Agression that has NO MERCY for INOCENT   people that are costantly SHELLED with MIG-23's and othe Russian aircraft.     At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the KARABAKH   crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER OCCUR again.   "

The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.    Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really  why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance  in Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYT  has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude  lower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to American  doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple  (early March).    Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the French  and Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Is  it because too many people take French and German in college to make  the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.  Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when  the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors  were just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength  rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized  medicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.    >""`You've got to remember, you've got a waiting list as well, but it's    >not as obvious.

For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why  certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can't  make a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance  rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medical  monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they  must move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking  of waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the  U.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis  E. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.    Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada's  health insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one  small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.    >WOULDN'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW    >FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?    >  >In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental    >care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private    >hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private    >insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40    >a month.      Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany  case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public  sector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra  insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward  accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal  benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be  covered for basic care.    At that point, they wouldn't even consider a ""voucher"" approach  to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up  the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.    >******************************************************************    >  >WOULDN'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY    >ACHE AND PAIN?    >  >People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about    >a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical    >bills.    >  >Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor's -- have a lower    >per-person health bill than we do.    It is ""free"" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two  things which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like  real health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when  working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying  for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my  pay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only  annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal  naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left for  that is part of their brainwashing agenda.    The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer   1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance  coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For   1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%  afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private  hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital  rate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same  cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid  out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,  the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not  gleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and  private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that  yield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.    >ISN'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG    >AND POWERFUL TO KILL?    >  >Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be    >""politically thorny,"" in the quiet words of one advocate for a    >national plan.

Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its  just that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada  and Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because  there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.    When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the  risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe  amenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on  the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat  themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec  last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against  any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's  public health insurance plan.    gld  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Gary L.

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE      archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly      included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or      the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming      missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.        Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news      frequently.          WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?        The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks      (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).        The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,      says:    	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is  	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower  	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)  	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a  	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other  	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort  	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of  	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining  	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target  	in second stage.""        This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try      to interpret.        1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.        2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack  	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the  	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line  	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly  	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of  	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z  	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""  	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the  	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.        3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more  	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or  	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be  	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").        4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated  	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort  	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver  	complexity"").        5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio  	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio  	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").        6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a  	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.        7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is  	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east  	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity  	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:  	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.  	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its  	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.        This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give      this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to      achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers      from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one      for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main      Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime      launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is      fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""      [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The      access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented      basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the      Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle      guy.)        I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll      maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.      The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons      stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping      the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw      component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total      maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math      concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element      array.          HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT        NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite      dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72      degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed      over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from      California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.      shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite      for these viewers.        If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.      It's worth asking if yours doesn't.        The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is      frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press      conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle      missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying      much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions      are not being covered.

Unless there has been a _major_ change in the law, there's no such beast     as a ""classified patent.""  Patents exist to encourage communications and     develop the state of the art.     While there aren't classified patents, there are ""patent secrecy orders"".    Suppose you invent a voice scrambler for CB radio, and apply for a patent.  The Patent Office decides the NSA might be interested, gives them a copy  of your application, and you get a nice note back saying your patent  application has now been classified for national security reasons and  you're no longer allowed to make and sell it.    I'm picking this example because it happened in the late 1970s.  It was probably some analog scrambler, and would have probably  violated FCC rules anyway, but it did get classified.    Or suppose you publish a paper on your Really Spiffy Algorithm and  then file a patent application.  Since it's been published,  they can't gain anything by classifying it, though you can't get  patents in most countries other than the US, where patent laws are different.    Obviously a system of classified patents would be highly bogus  ""You can't sell that widget, because there's a classified patent on it.  You're not allowed to see the patent, or know who owns the design,  so just give us all your money and work in progress and maybe we won't throw  you in jail for espionage.""  Some countries might have that kind of  system :-(, but we don't have that here.  Quite.

Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions  of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and  non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much  of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.  The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and  even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL  charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA  commercialization centers; they charge a fee.    Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack  experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand  the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack  of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it  is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't  a flame, jsut a statement.    Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.    >>Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate.

Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in  their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can  change depending on the customer.    >No Allen you did not.

Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When  WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where  doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the  only place you would find people actually interested in solving the  problems and building a station.    >Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is  >at a place where everything is overhead.    When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that  integration isn't overhead.

The fact remains that it is the centers  you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address  the problems until the press published the story.    Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address  the overruns?

2,    	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's  syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome.    	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for  hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the  hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion  from it.     	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level  but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous  endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the  hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).    I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an  abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. .     I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.    I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel  to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.    Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much  improvement in her condition over the past several months.     -Jackie-

Everything was going well for us: my older   daughter was studying at the Institute, the middle one was preparing to enter   medical school and was interning as an orderly, and my youngest had been sick   for a long time, but had returned to health. I have been though a lot in my   life: it's been seven years since I lost my husband, I raised my children by   myself. Lots of women have similar fates, but there's nothing to be done about  it. But I can't control myself when I remember what happened in Sumgait on   February 27, 28, and 29, it was just a horror, it's indescribable.    On February 27 our relative, Ira, came to visit us. She's better friends with  my oldest daughter, and so right away she asked, ""Where's Vika?"" I say,  ""Vika's off in Pirkuli on a trip for three days, she's supposed to come back  tomorrow."" My middle daughter, Gaya, had baked a cake and we sat there talking  and laughing, drinking tea. Then Gaya and Diana went to walk Ira home.    They left and a few minutes went by; suddenly I hear noise. I raced out to  the balcony--our balcony is right across from the bus station, we live at the  corner of Mir and Druzhba Streets--I look and see that there are hoards of  people near the bus station and they're all shouting something. What they're  shouting I can't understand. Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too. I  ask, ""Nufar, what's happened?"" He says, ""I don't know, I can't figure it out  either."" I got scared--the kids had gone outside, and I wanted to run after  them, but then there was a knock at the door. I open the door and it's the  kids. ""Mamma,"" says Gayane, ""you'll never believe what's going on out there!   It's awful!"" Ira says, ""Aunt Zina, they're shouting, 'Karabagh! Karabagh!   Karabagh is ours!' We didn't know what was going on. They're threatening to   drive out the Armenians and slaughter them.""    I called my brother, and his wife answered the phone. I said, ""Aunt Tamara,   don't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later."" I   couldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning. I was worried about  Vika. My God, what was going on, what had happened?!    -Gayane: That day, on the 27th, we stood on the balcony and observed what was   happening, although Mamma wouldn't allow us to watch all of it. There weren't   50 yards between our building and the bus station. We could see and hear   everything perfectly. They were stopping buses, dragging people out, leading   all the passengers out, looking for Armenians. If they found an Armenian on   the bus, then it started . . .I don't know what to call it . . .    -Zinaida: It's called slaughter.    -Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them. I don't know if they   were killing them or not, but when they left them, they lay still, not moving,  as though nothing was left of them. One person was lying there and they   started dragging him. The police were standing right there, to the side, not   doing anything, they didn't take any steps to calm that mob.    It was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. And you   couldn't go anywhere, somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything  so as to tell of it later. We wanted to leave Sumgait that day. What kept us  was the idea that we live in the Soviet Union, and that something would be  done about it. Where in the world was our government?!    -Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn't  home. And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana. On Sunday   morning when I went to see Ira home, our neighbor said, ""Zin', you know they   went into Valodya's house and smashed everything he had. They murdered his   father and two sons."" Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on   the first floor. I think, my God, what is happening?! And in broad daylight!    I saw Ira home and when on the way back I came across a mob shouting ""Slay the  Armenians! Karabagh is ours!"" This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. On the   way I stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says, ""They beat our store  manager, they thought he was an Armenian and they beat him, but he was an   Azerbaijani."" And I asked, ""Did they kill him?"" She says, ""No, he's in serious  condition."" I left there and started to walk home on that same street, but the  mob started moving in my direction. I turned off the street and went down the   little way that goes toward the Sputnik store. There I met another crowd, but   these weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait. I was so frightened  that I walked without knowing where was going, I couldn't feel my legs or the   ground under my feet. I was walking and there was a boy standing before my   eyes. This was on the 27th, around evening time. He ran under our balcony, and  the mob surged toward him shouting, ""He's an Armenian, get him!"" He wore a   black coat. They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it. They   grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.    I made it home but I just couldn't calm down. My oldest daughter was in my   thoughts. I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus   and she'll be gone. There's no police, no protection, nothing. It's like they   had all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever. I can't even  find the words for it! I look and see an Ikarus arriving. Before going to the   bus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater. So  this Ikarus stops  there and the gang is yelling, the Azerbaijanis are running  toward it yelling, ""Armenians out!"" And I see them take the Armenians and beat  them, killing them. I can't watch it any more. It was a nightmare. I just   couldn't watch it. But Gaya was standing there watching it, and I scolded her.  She says, ""Mamma, I have to see it, I have to know what's happening, I have to  see it with my own eyes so I can tell our people of it later. So our children   will know.""    Gayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th. They caught no less than 20 people  before my eyes. I can't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .    -Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big. You couldn't   make anything out. But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. He  was 18 or 19 years old.    -Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22. A tall fellow, a big guy,   in a coat. He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was an  Armenian, he tore off running. And the mob went after him. They caught him   right under our balcony. I don't know. I don't think there could have been   much left of him after that. You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks  one person. It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless. You know, there was a   similarity in the way they were dressed, mostly they were wearing long black   coats. You couldn't even tell them apart, they were all wearing black and they  all looked alike.    -Zinaida: When they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and   he cried ""Mamma!"" I ran into the room. I couldn't watch any longer. An awful   lot was going on right then, in various places, it wasn't only that boy,   several people were being beaten up. You couldn't see all of it at once, but   when that boy cried ""Mamma!"" I immediately started watching only him.    -Gayane: On that first day it went on from about six in the morning until  twelve at night. At midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.  They were scattered about in all districts. But how can you explain the fact  that by morning, when it had already started getting light, around seven  o'clock, our police were gone? The police disappeared and yielded their  positions to the bandits. In the morning they started gathering at our inter-  section again, at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. From  morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered, and by nine  o'clock you couldn't even see the ground. There were thousands of people in  the crowd. Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.    -Zinaida: They had signals. I realized that when I noticed that they made a   cross with their arms, they crossed their arms over their heads. The cross,  evidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it. They let the  Azerbaijani cars through, and they stopped the Armenian ones and started  their pogrom.    -Gayane: They stopped a white Zhiguli and asked the driver what his   nationality was. He got out and said they were from Baku. ""But what is your  nationality?"" He says Armenian. They immediately start shouting, ""Ermeni,  Ermeni!"" And he says, ""What's going on? I'm coming from Baku. I don't live  in Sumgait."" ""Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait.""  Anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him, and they dragged a   woman--his wife, probably--out of the car. At this point the police came and   took the two and led them away. Then the mob started smashing the car, and   then burned it. The flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire! Then everyone   ran away, they thought the car was going to explode. About 20 minutes later   another car comes along, a green Moskvich. They ran up shouting ""Ermeni!   Ermeni!"" But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn't  beat them. Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged   from the flames. The neighbor boy Vakhit was standing on the balcony too,   acquaintances of his walked by below, and he asked them and they said, ""Yes,   they burned them along with the car."" About two hours later a whole wedding   procession came by, and there was a doll on the first car. We thought they   were Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly. They were Azerbaijanis,   and they were immediately allowed through.    -Zinaida: The driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' The  whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.    -Gayane: By the way, at the marriage hall, which is right in the courtyard  of our building, there was a wedding that day. The Azerbaijanis were cele-  brating and dancing. On the streets there was grief and death, people were  being killed, and people were celebrating the whole time.    -Zinaida: Before the apartment itself was attacked I asked Gaya to call and   find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. She went to her   girlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third   floor. Gaya came back and said, ""Mamma, the bus is supposed to come around  eight, after eight."" You can imagine what I was feeling, how hard it was:  Vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death.   Then I heard shouting. I raced to the window and see that the belongings of   our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. They were   thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. I   started to cry. I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not   here, what will come of her . . . Gaya, of course, was consoling me: ""Mamma,   nothing will happen to her, don't worry, calm down, she's in good company,   they'll look out for her.""    Diana: I saw the green car burn. The car was burning when we went out onto the  balcony. Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony. I left. Then   they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any Armenians here.    -Zinaida: You're right, I forgot about that, that was on the 27th.    Diana: There's a small, grassy area in front of our balcony; there are trees  planted there. The mob asked if there were any Armenians in the building.  All the neighbors said, no, there are no Armenians here. There weren't a lot  of Armenians in our building, but there weren't just a few Armenian families,   either.    -Gayane: They fell upon the apartments on the 28th. There were terribly many   of them. Our courtyard is huge, and it was completely filled with them.    -Zinaida: Katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. He said that   two people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh. And when he said that   . . . you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz? It was like the   buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our   courtyard, howling and shouting. I don't know how to describe it. By this   point we were afraid to watch from the balcony, but when I looked out of the   bedroom window--the Znaniye Bookstore is down there, and Armenians live on the   second and fourth floors--I saw their things being thrown out the windows. I   realized that they would be upon us any minute. I shouted to Gayane, ""Gaya,   hide the gold."" That's honestly what I told my child. I grabbed Diana. I   didn't know what to do! Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting   dark. I was afraid to look at the time because I was already horrified as it   was.    -Gayane: Just in case, we changed the television channel from the Moscow   station to the Azerbaijani one.    -Zinaida: And turned it up loud.    -Gayane: We never listened to Azerbaijani music. It just didn't do much for   us. In all those years we almost never listened to it. But sometimes we would  watch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television. And that was   it. And here we had it turned up full blast. So they would think we were   Azerbaijanis.    -Zinaida: Well you can imagine, they're slaughtering Armenians, robbing them,   and we're listening to this concert music from Baku. Our Azerbaijani neighbors  suggested we do it, they knocked on the door and told Gaya to turn on   Azerbaijani music. But we already had it on anyway. Turn on the lights, they   told us, so they will think you're not Armenians. They're saying the Armenians  are afraid to turn on their lights, they're hiding.    -Gayane: Apparently there was some kind of arrangement, because we noticed   that the lights were off only in Armenian apartments, that is, the   Azerbaijanis were warned, and every last one of them had their lights on.  When we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately, and  later, another one. ""Turn on the lights,"" they told us, ""please. Nothing will  happen. Be calm. Nothing will happen.""    -Zinaida: ""We won't allow them to come into your apartment.""    -Gayane: We believed those people. We had never done anything bad to them.      -Zinaida: After the whole nightmare, about March 15, before we left for  Armenia, when I was coming into the building they were all crying. The  Azerbaijanis were crying, saying, ""Can it be there is no God? How could  they raise their hands against your family? You never did anyone any harm,  you never refused anyone anything, not in hard times, or in time of fortune,  or in time of mourning. How could they give you away? How could they sell you   down the river?"" They really had given us away. Some of them protected us, but  others gave us away. They sold us down the river.    -Gayane: I was wearing slacks that day, and when it all began I became   cautious for some reason and I changed my clothes. Azerbaijani women don't   wear pants. Young Armenian and Russian girls in Sumgait wore pants, but the   Azerbaijanis found that very strange. And I thought I better put on a skirt,   otherwise they won't believe me if I told them we were Azerbaijanis. There was  nothing else we could do. No other way out. I was forced to turn myself into   God knows who. I let my hair down, tousled it, and threw a scarf over my head.    -Zinaida: And she told me, ""Mamma, you hide. Take Diana and go into the other   room. You two look more like Armenians. They'll figure out that we're   Armenians right away."" But how could I go away and leave her there?!    -Gayane: I went out onto the balcony. It worked out better that way. We were   the only Armenian family in the fourth entryway. This gave us hope: we were   the only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in. They, the Azerbaijanis,   would fear for themselves and for their children. I looked and saw someone   crawling up on the balcony from below, it was easy to get up onto our balcony.  When we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and   we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. So I turned around  and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. He looks at me and shouts, ""What   nationality are you here?""    -Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.    -Gayane: ""What nationality are you?"" he's shouting. Well at first I was  frightened, but then I got control of myself and answered in perfect   Azerbaijani, ""You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a question like that.  Can't you see I'm an Azerbaijani? If I were an Armenian would I come out to   meet you face to face and look you in the eyes?"" He looks at me and tells the  people with him, ""Yes, Azerbaijanis live here."" From below they tell him,  ""Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians."" And he asks me again,  ""What nationality are you?"" I say, ""Can't you see?"" I started fuming. I could  not say anything else. ""You're blind, that's for sure! You can yell all you  want, but that won't make us Armenians."" I hear them breaking down our  door, and Mamma went toward the door. I say, ""I don't have time to deal  with you, they're breaking down our door."" 1 go to the door and ask, ""Who is  it?"" They answer, ""Open up!"" I say, ""Wait, why are you breaking the door?  What's going on? I'm opening up."" We never locked the lower lock, it was  broken, but now they had locked it out of fear, and I couldn't get it open. I  say wait, I'm looking for the key. I opened the door--it was almost broken  down already. I opened the door and they burst in. I say, ""What's going on?  Why are you breaking down our door?""    -Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony. They're shouting,   ""Why don't you open the door?"" And I say, ""Well you've already come in the   balcony."" Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes the  door. Gaya cries out, ""Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!"" I ran to the door   and forgot that we were pretending to be Azerbaijanis, and said in Armenian:   ""Diana, open the door!"" Gaya tried to calm them down, and I'm shouting with  tears in my eyes for Diana to open the door.    -Diana I was sitting on the couch with my doll, Little Red Riding Hood. That   guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. They   put it up to Mamma's stomach. I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and   slammed it behind me. I was frightened, and started to cry. I shouted, ""Mamma,  they want to kill you!"" And then . . . then they started shouting, ""Give us   your passports."" And Gaya says, ""What do you need passports for, we're   Azerbaijanis.""    -Gayane: I tried to convince them that we were Azerbaijanis, I was trying  everything I could, I could get on my knees and plead. I could humble myself,   because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own. To be  honest I didn't care about anything else, as long as my little sister would   survive, her life and health had cost us so dearly! I tell them, ""What, don't   you understand anything?"" They started shouting, they were tremendously   excited, shouting with terribly loud voices, saying that in Stepanakert their   girls were being killed, raped, and tossed around with pitchforks. Why   shouldn't they do the same to us? I said, ""Who's doing all that? Who is doing   it? Some Armenians! What does that have to do with us? Give me the knife, I'll  cut my own face."" ""Now you calm down,"" they tell me.    Zinaida: I told them, ""Why didn't you deal with them there! There, in   Karabakh? Nothing has happened here, no one has been fighting here, not we   with the Armenians, nor they with us. Why didn't you give it right back to  them there? What've we got to do with this?"" I got confused. I had been  saying that we were Azerbaijanis, but suddenly I started speaking as though  I were an Armenian, but they didn't notice. One of them was next to me,  with a knife at my breast. And he says to the others, ""What pretty girls."" He  meant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana. I was terrified. Gaya started assuring   them that we were Azerbaijanis. One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad   looks.    -Gayane: He demanded the passports. I said, ""Young man, I don't have my   passport here."" He says, ""Let's have the passport, we won't believe you  without your passport."" And one of them started hurriedly searching for  documents. They turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down, took the   picture off the wall, and started pulling the clothes off their hooks, yelling  and shouting, ""Passport! Passport!"" They all started yelling, there was so   much noise in the apartment. They were all shouting. My hair stood on end.   Suddenly I said, ""Listen, my Papa died, 40 days haven't passed yet, we have a   Muslim household, we're in mourning, you should be ashamed of yourselves,   you've disgraced your honor."" And then Mamma started to cry.    -Zinaida: I started crying: ""My husband died, 40 days haven't yet passed,  aren't you ashamed of yourselves!"" In fact my husband had died seven years  earlier, in 1981. ""We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-  ments. The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension.""  Well it seemed like they believed us. Then one guy said, ""They're Lezgins.  Can't you see, there are no men here, only women. Leave."" Another fellow in  the group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins. But a third  said, ""No, they're Armenians."" Well the other two convinced him, I don t know   how, and all the rest of them listened to them too. There were about 50 of   them, if not more, all in our three-room apartment, even the entryway was   filled. They started leaving. Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins."" They started  leaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him. And the one who had   first called us Lezgins says, ""Leave that, what are you doing?"" They seemed to  obey that guy.    -Gayane: He was tall, wearing baggy jeans and a coat.    -Zinaida: With a little moustache, I think.    -Gayane: No, he didn't have a moustache, he was tall with brown hair, he   wasn't a bad-looking sort. He didn't have anything in his hands.    -Zinaida: He stood at the threshold.    -Gayane: Yes, he didn't look like a bad guy, and you know, his face seemed   familiar to me. I had seen him somewhere. And more than once. But I can't   remember where. When he came in I was stupefied, I had a premonition that he   wouldn't be able to remain indifferent. When he said that we were Lezgins and   that they should leave, such gladness started to glow inside of me. Hope. They  continued to argue on their way out. Some said, ""They're Armenians all the   same."" And that fellow answered, ""even if they are Armenians, it's shameful,  the father died, they're mourning, there's nothing but women in the house,   there's no men. We should stay out of the apartment."" ""What do you mean, stay   out? We can go in there!"" And he said, ""No, we should stay out, they're   Lezgins, we're leaving here."" The three of them protected us.       -Zinaida: No, the two of them. The one in the short coat and the one in the  grey suit, who stood at the threshold, about 19 or 20 years old. Well they  were all young really. The two of them defended us.    -Diana: Three, three!    -Zinaida: Do you remember the third one, Diana?    -Diana: Yes, he was wearing dark clothes.    -Gayane: The third one was the one who came back. He wore a long brown coat.    -Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too. When   they left, they told him downstairs that those women were Armenians, and ran   back and said that they were going to kill us.    -Zinaida: They had all left, and we had started to calm down a little, and I  closed the door. And then there is a knock. I told Gaya, ""Take Diana and go  into the other room."" My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened the  door. There was a guy there who said, ""Run, hide! They're coming to kill you   now!"" We ran up to the third floor. We had some good neighbors up there,  Azerbaijanis. I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do.   I was so far gone . . . Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything   to take. I even forgot to take my work documents; at the time I had been   preparing a report to send to Baku, and the documents were at home. I couldn't  see anything . . . I could only see Vika, my older daughter. I sent Gaya and   Diana upstairs, and stood there asking that fellow, ""Should I close the door   and leave everything like this?"" He says, ""What do you mean, door? Get out of   here, they're coming to kill you! What are you standing there for?"" And I ran   after the children.    -Gayane: We barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into   our apartment and started shouting, ""Where are the Armenians?"" We were already  at the neighbors'. They had an infant at the time, and the neighbor said,   ""Don't you worry, I'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what.""    -Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,  to go meet Vika. The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. I dissolved in  tears, Gaya was soothing me, Diana was next to us, she was crying too, and I'm  already thinking that I've lost my older daughter, but deep in my heart I   still believe she's alive . . . And my tears choked me. I was going out of my  mind. But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed with  people, swarming with them. From the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment   we were hiding asked the bandits, ""Where are those Armenians, the ones who   were at home? Where did they make off to?"" They told him they didn't know.   They asked him where he lived. He answered, ""Can't you see, on the third   floor."" He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. We  heard them taking free reign of our apartment, and they threw our color   television off the balcony and it exploded.    -Gayane: Mamma was crying the whole time. She fell into a faint and we brought  her around and held her back, because the whole time she kept making for the   door to go outside, alternately raving and sobbing, shouting, and calling   Vika. She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her. Her thoughts  were only on Vika. The neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too,   offering tea.    -Zinaida: We are very grateful to them. Thanks to them my children and I are  alive, well, and unharmed. When they were throwing our belongings out and   burning them--the beds, the pillows, and the chairs--our neighbor came to us   and said, ""How lucky you are that it's not you standing there naked, but some   other woman instead. You're from our part of the building you lost your   husband, you have children, thank God you're not in her position, we wouldn't   have been able to take it. I don't know what I would do."" He of course   wouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down. In the yard   they were torturing our neighbors, fellow Armenians They lived on the fifth   floor, in the third entryway. A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their   three children. Their last name is V. They hid their two daughters, and stayed  with their son to defend themselves, they even got boiling water ready, and an  axe, and held them off for a long time, but the . . . They beat up the   husband, dragged the wife outside, and stood her naked next to our burning   things; her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. The crowd shouted,   ""Look at the naked Armenian!"" They were going to throw the poor woman into the  fire. The neighbors came out, an Azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf, and she   covered herself with it, and the neighbors led her off to their apartment.   All the neighbors saw and heard it . . .    -Gayane: Mamma wouldn't allow it but I went to the window and saw her standing  there, and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them   into her body. Our neighbor, who lived in the same entryway as Nina--she   lives with us in the same boarding house now--saw what they had done, Nina   showed her, from her knees up, almost up to her neck, her whole body was   covered, riddled, with wounds.    -Zinaida: In the morning, during the night of the 29th, rather, after one  o'clock, two buses approached the station. I wanted to run out. By then I  didn't care any more if I lived or died, but Gayane wouldn't let me go, and  the neighbors said that I would bring disaster to them and they would be  slain along with their children. Gaya was crying and said that I forgot about  them, my other children, but I could only think of Vika. I imagined her torn  to pieces, I'm a mother, and they're just children, they don't understand I  would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. I was  going to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: ""Mamma, please! Mamma, I beg of   you!"" The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries. So we   held on that way till morning.    On the morning of the 29th I told our neighbor I was going to go downstairs to  our apartment, maybe Vika was lying there, murdered. He told me he would go   himself. He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity to  me. He returned and said there was no one there, nothing. I went down too,   stole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about. I   didn't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far   away, farther than the bus station. I began looking for the briefcase with my   work in it. I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time   because of my work. My documents were there, my travel papers--I worked in the  transport division -- and my trip sheets.    -Gayane: Mamma is a very responsible person, she was always ready to work   around the clock to do her job.    -Zinaida: I look around and I can't find the briefcase. I didn't care about   the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms, that  everything was smashed, and the furniture was broken, I worried about that  later, but at first I was concerned about the lost documents. I went into the  kitchen. My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and   my earrings. It was all there. Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,  ""Mamma, hurry."" And Diana came downstairs too. Gayane found  her coat among   the debris, and Diana found her track shoes, her coat, and some of her   dresses.    -Diana: Immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started   throwing things around in the apartment under us. They threw a television onto  the asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. Then,   when Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't   eat. Because I loved Vika terribly and she and I had always gone to the movies  and gone for walks in the park. When we went into our apartment the next day   and everything was broken, right away I started looking for my dolls and my   books, but I didn't see anything. When we went back upstairs I managed to take  two cups from my tea service, and Gaya took Vika's suit and one of her own   dresses. My Italian boots were gone, my brown coat, it was beautiful, there   wasn't a one of my beautiful dolls, and my giant lion was gone too, the one   that had been on top of the television. He was very large and very handsome.   I had two satchels, one for first grade and the other for second grade, one   was yellow-green with a boy and a girl on it, they're playing a drum and a   violin, and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears, and on the other   one were the letters A, B, C, D, E and the numbers 4+5, two girls and a boy   with their mouths open like they are singing. They were beautiful satchels.   They were gone too. I had many books, I collected them, they were in the   bedside tables. And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my   birthday, they weren't around either. And I had some big books, fat ones, and   they disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box. The Adventures of   Karlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left. All the   other books were gone.    -Zinaida: I continued searching for my briefcase, and then my supervisor  arrived. He had waited for me until nine o'clock, but I didn't appear, and he  thought something must have happened, so he came. He's a Russian, Aleksei   Semyonovich Lomakin. Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him. When they saw   my wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing.   When I saw them I started crying. My Azerbaijani neighbors came in. Some of   them were crying, others were helping me pick up. I go on looking for my   documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. Now that I   remember it it's both funny and painful: How could I have thought that I had   returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal?   Incidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things were  gone too. And the door was gone. After my supervisor left, in the afternoon,   the neighbor said that we should leave, find another refuge. ""I'm afraid,"" he   said, ""that someone saw you come to my apartment, and that they could kill you  and us too. My God, where could I go it was daytime and those . . . I don't   even know what to call them, the bandits, those marauders, those jackals, I   don't know what to call them, I can't find the words, they were everywhere.   Where should I go with two girls? When I opened the door I had tears in my   eyes, and I was terrified . . . And he said, ""Go to Alik's, he's an  Azerbaijani, too."" and I say, ""You should have said that earlier, when my   supervisor was here with the car, he could have taken us with him."" Everyone   feared for their own lives. What could I do? I went out into the entryway and   stood. And he says, ""any other time I would keep you here a year, or two. But   right now, I'm sorry . . . "" Then another door opened, also on the third   floor. I ask the neighbor, ""Tayara, can we hide at your place?"" She's an   Azerbaijani too. She says, ""What kind of question is that? Come in!"" She hid   us. There were many people in the courtyard, and Gaya and I hid in the   wardrobe, and they put Diana under a mattress, leaving a small opening so the   child could breathe. Tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us   out, and when they came back she would hide us again.    We sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. Gaya became ill, and I allowed   her to get out. My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. We hadn't eaten or   drunk anything for so long, since the 27th, when we saw that horror--and all   of it just snapped in me. Tayara's husband went outside, even though I begged   him to stay, saying there should be a man in the house. He said that he'd be   in the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him. She put   her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came   in she could show them that they were an Azerbaijani family. My girls went to   the window--and what was going on out there! I feared for my children, that   someone would recognize them from the street. Gaya let her hair down and put   on a scarf so she would resemble an Azerbaijani, but directly across there was  a 9-story building, their windows were right across from us, and I shouted   that someone would see her and give us away on the spot. But she kept on   looking.    -Diana: I watched too.    -Zinaida: Downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. The soldiers  didn't shoot, they didn't have orders to. I saw them throwing rocks at  the soldiers, they were young boys, 18- and 19-year olds, and they defended  themselves . . . I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from my  children. When one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding I had to  stop looking, l couldn't watch anymore . . . I imagined my children in their  shoes . . .    -Gayane: The troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned   off the buildings, and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station, Block   36, and our Microdistrict 3. But they only cordoned them off from the outside.  The mob fell upon the soldiers, who started to protect themselves, and the mob  surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. They caught several   Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. One fell down and they  cracked open another's head . . .    -Zinaida: They show Lebanon on television, and the war in Afghanistan--that's just  what it was like. Like in America, how they attack demonstrations with shields  and clubs--that's just how it was in our courtyard.    -Gayane: Don't compare it with America, those were peaceful demonstrations,   but these?!    -Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America! They   attacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them . . . Then I thought, where's the  tear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators? If they had used   gas on those jackals they all would have scattered.    -Gayane: They would not have scattered. The soldiers had been there since   morning, they didn't bring in fresh troops. They hadn't eaten, they were fine   standing there for about three hours, but then they got tired. They weren't   even allowed to sit down . . . At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and   then the tables were turned. The mob went after the soldiers, the guys were   bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their   shields, and the Azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.  And those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. And meanwhile  tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . They always say, ""Our   children have never seen war."" I never even dreamed about it, there was no   need to. But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war. It  was truly horrible . . . The guys were tired, exhausted, some had had their   clubs taken away, others, their shields, they had been beaten, they were   covered in blood . . . so many died! They beat the soldiers with their own   clubs and shields. And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves,   they couldn't open fire. They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us.   It's comical . . .    -Zinaida: What are you saying? How can it be funny?    -Gayane: No, I didn't mean that: How could something like that happen during   our Soviet period? It's painfully embarrassing! And they burned the armored   personnel carriers, too. Someone shouted, ""Get away, it's going to blow!""   Everyone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded. The   soldiers lost their senses. And when they drove the personnel carrier and the   bus at the mob out of rage and fury, they drove right up on the sidewalk.    -Zinaida: The bus that had brought the troops. Only the driver was in it. The   bus ran over three people straight off, I saw it. And two armored personnel   carriers ran over four more. All in one or two minutes. The bus ran over   three, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more. Right on   our street there's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places; one   of the armored personnel carriers went that way, and they say it ran over  several over there, too. But they ran over seven before our eyes. Then the bus  ploughed into a book kiosk.    -Gayane: No, that was a flower place. It was a new booth. He drove straight   into it.    -Zinaida: The driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the  middle of the road and set it on fire.    -Gayane: And I also saw the troops put a bunch of Azerbaijanis in a bus and   take them in a convoy to Baku. There were many arrests.    -Zinaida: Our neighbor, the one who hid us, couldn't take it, and he told his   wife that we should leave. They were running around in the courtyard looking   for the Armenians. They knew that they were hiding with Azerbaijanis, and they  were saying that they were going to check the Azerbaijani families. Poor   Tayara got scared too, and started to cry; I pleaded with her, I said that I   would remember forever how she saved my children and me, but where could we   go?    -Gayane: She didn't make us leave, she said that she would do anything, but   she was afraid.    -Zinaida: I told Tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at  night we would return to our apartment. Then her husband came back and said   that a curfew had been imposed. He says, ""Zina, you owe us a drink. Gorbachev   announced a curfew."" And Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of   Azerbaijan SSR] was on television, he said that two people had been killed in   Karabagh, but nothing was wrong, automobile windows had been broken, but there  hadn't been any killings. He kept making statements, and there were   Azerbaijani songs and dances. Tayara turned the TV all the way up. When we   learned of the curfew we calmed down, but then a crowd ran into the courtyard   again, a large one. Our neighbor told them that there had been only one   Armenian family here, but they had already killed them all, there was no one   left. We hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck Diana back under the bed.    -Gayane: Tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there, and  found two bandits. They asked her, ""What are you doing here"" Tayara answered,   ""I came to take something for myself."" ""Take all you want, they're gone now.""     -Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding.   She said, ""What are you going to do, empty handed, naked, with three children,  nothing remains of your entire apartment."" In short, we calmed down, and the   crowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us. I don't know   what went on there.    -Gayane: The curfew had its effect on the gangs, many started to disperse:  they were warned that they would open fire on them. The soldiers didn't know   the city, they couldn't get oriented, they drove up and down the main streets,  but didn't go into the courtyards. When we were at the City Party Committee   they asked people from Sumgait to go with them and show them the way.    -Zinaida: The tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.    -Gayane: No, Mamma, the tanks had been there earlier, but were near the City   Party Committee, where the Armenians were . . . After midnight, on March 1,   when I had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights, Mamma said,   ""Get your things together, they have sent buses for us."" As it was we had been  dressed the entire time. Mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.    -Zinaida: When I came back for the children Tayara said that Vika was alive   and well, some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe   place. I both believed it and didn't believe it. We ran out to the tanks. The   Gambarians were there, Roman and Sasha; their father, Shurik, the clarinetist,  was killed, and their mother was there. Sasha came over and asked about the   girls. I was surprised, how did he know my girls? He said that he knew me and   the girls. Our neighbor himself went for Gaya and Diana and it seemed like he   was taking forever so I went after him. Another neighbor came out, Anna   Vasilyevna, a Russian: ""Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck."" She kissed   Diana. They put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be   taken to the City Party Committee. The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on   another one. It was pouring rain.    -Diana: When they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets,   and they all had clubs and shields. And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them,   many of the soldiers died. They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the   soldiers. I saw this myself. The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with the  tanks. The soldiers saw that the Azerbaijanis were doing violence to people   and they ran over them out of rage. We got scared and they hid me under a   mattress and a blanket, and Gaya and Mamma crawled into the wardrobe. And they  were fighting right down there on the street . . . Near the building they were  blowing up buses and tanks, and cars were burning, and there were many dead in  the courtyard. They drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a   street, they just drove, and the ones who didn't manage to get out of the way   were run over by the tanks. And when we left--it was evening, it was already   dark--there were three buses, and one of them had soldiers in it. Mamma ran up  and said, ""Get your clothes on, let's go."" Gaya was wearing slippers, and I   had on my blue dress, but it was an old one. I was wearing my old jacket, my   old dress, and slippers. And nothing else. Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora   sweater, and slippers. It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the   street. They gave Mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short-sleeved   dress; she put it on and we ran out. We got onto the bus and I was hungry, one  of the soldiers from Yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to  the other in his arms. I gave him the little glass that remained from Vika's  trousseau, and he gave me his telephone number.    -Gayane: In the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.  We had to be ready for anything. They took us to the City Party Committee, let  us out, and then took us into the City Party Committee building under armed   guard. It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe. We asked, ""Are   these all us? Armenians?"" They answered yes. We were surprised that there were  so many Armenians in Sumgait. All those years we lived there and didn't know   there were so many Armenians, 18,000. We were struck by that, we had never   noticed. Going downstairs the next day I ran into the Secretary of the   Komsomol from Vika's plant, the Khimprom. He said that Vika was alive and   well. When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more. But you know,   after all that it was hard to believe anything, our faith in everything was   just gone. She didn't believe it completely.    -Zinaida: I didn't believe it because I had heard all kinds of things. When  we arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable! It  was the fear of God. I saw many of our acquaintances, they were kissing each   other and asking how their children and homes were. Many people already knew   that there had been a pogrom of our apartment. They had seen the broken   windows. I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was. One woman said   that they had taken two of her daughters and that she couldn't find one of   them; the other had been slashed all over. A second said that her husband and  her son had been murdered. That was Nelli Aramian. She lived in Building 6 in   our microdistrict. They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur. I heard   so many things like that that I was already starting to lose touch; my   patience had run dry waiting for my daughter. Later an Azerbaijani fellow came  to me and said, Aunt Zina, Vika sent me, she's alive and well and hidden in a   safe place; if you want I'll call her there and you can speak with her. We   went downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika. I spoke with her, heard  the voice of my child. She had managed to survive in that hell. Then I started  begging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee. He tried to  talk me out of it: ""I'll bring her wherever you go, don't worry, I've looked   after her better than a brother does a sister."" All the same I asked him to   get her. He brought her and I calmed down. On the second day there was a   meeting with Demichev [Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the  Communist Party of the USSR,] and people started shouting. One shouted, ""Give   me my son back!"", another yelled, ""Where is my daughter?!"", a third wanted her  husband . . . Bagirov  was there too, and he stood there blinking, not saying   anything.    -Gayane: When Demichev asked where we wanted to go, everyone shouted, ""To  Russia!"" To be honest we were all frightened of Armenia, there were such wild   rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream, and no one wanted to go   to Armenia. But he said that he couldn't evacuate 18,000 people to Russia and   that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with   them. And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our   apartments. On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of   Nasosny. We were taken care of marvelously by the military. They sent special   flights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow. One   woman left for Moscow with a letter for Gorbachev and Gromyko.    -Zinaida: The worst was truly behind us by then. Everything had passed, but   the pain will remain for our whole lives. It cannot be forgotten. Under no   circumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget. Who will  answer for those who died? For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons and  daughters? Who will bear the responsibility? Who will wash away their blood?   Someone should be made to answer, and severely, so it has an effect on the   people that did with us as they pleased . . . It isn't over yet, now we live   here, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved. We would like  to stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will be  united. Then we will be invincible. Armenians won't be scattered throughout   the Soviet Union, about the world, and if we're all together this won't happen  again. As a mother of three children, as a woman, as a sister, I ask Armenians  to be united so that what happened in Sumgait will never happen again. Our   homeland . . . The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an   apartment and getting jobs. So that our children can work for the good of   Armenia. If we aren't able to, then let our children do it. And if it's   possible, we'll work for the good of Armenia too. This is the land of our   forefathers. Our grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived here too, it was   only later that people dispersed all over. Like a mother, the land here bore   and reared us. It is our wife, and will protect us, too. I want but one thing:  that our people never see the hardship that our children saw, that your   children here, in Armenia, never see anything like it.

The thing  that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying  a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their  person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many  people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.  Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above  quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I  am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether  or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that  I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street.  Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he  seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense.  I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is  useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now  is that Freeman and I are ""running around in circles"" trying to prove each  other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course  now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier  posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky  about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some-  times.    Jason - u28037@uicvm.cc.uic.edu "

It would if malpractice and ""defensive medicine"" were the main  factors in explaining spiralling US health care costs, but they aren't.    Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems are  greater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overall  difference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat larger  portion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)    Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% of  total health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of   physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averaged  paying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.    Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;  they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, health  care costs have increased more than any period in history.    As far as ""defensive medicine"" is concerned, the AMA estimates that its  total impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the total  current INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a group  that could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicine  on health care.    As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,  Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnification  of MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by their  specialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suits  while retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.    jsh  --  Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM     ""One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh   the bulls**t."" - R.

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with  the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.  Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time  of arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often  get positions down to ~arc minutes.    BTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the  fairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1  ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a  distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing  and t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the  order of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this  number considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the  wrong direction.    	Paul "

The report on Western Thrace emphasized that the Greek government  should grant  social and political  rights to all the  members of  minorities that are equal to  those enjoyed by Greek citizens and  in addition  they must  recognize the  existence of  the ""Turkish  Minority"" in Western Thrace and  grant them the right to identify  themselves as 'Turks'.    NEWSPOT, May 1992    |2|    GREECE ISOLATES WEST THRACE TURKS    The  Xanthi independent  MP Ahmet  Faikoglu said  that the  Greek  state is trying to cut all  contacts and relations of the Turkish  minority with Turkey.    Pointing out that while the  Greek minority living in Istanbul is  called ""Greek""  by ethnic  definition, only  the religion  of the  minority in  Western Thrace is  considered. In an  interview with  the Greek  newspaper ""Ethnos"" he said:  ""I am a Greek  citizen of  Turkish origin. The individuals of the minority living in Western  Trace are also Turkish.""    Emphasizing  the education  problem for  the Turkish  minority in  Western  Thrace  Faikoglu said  that  according  to an  agreement  signed in 1951 Greece must distribute textbooks printed in Turkey  in Turkish minority schools in Western Thrace.    Recalling his activities and those of Komotini independent MP Dr.  SadIk  Ahmet  to  defend  the rights  of  the  Turkish  minority,  Faikoglu said.  ""In fact we  helped Greece. Because  we prevented  Greece, the cradle of democracy, from losing face before European  countries by forcing the Greek  government to recognize our legal  rights.""    On Turco-Greek relations, he pointed  out that both countries are  predestined  to live  in  peace for  geographical and  historical  reasons and said  that Turkey and Greece must  resist the foreign  powers  who  are  trying  to   create  a  rift  between  them  by  cooperating, adding  that in  Turkey he  observed that  there was  will to improve relations with Greece.    NEWSPOT, January 1993    |3|    MACEDONIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO FACE TRIAL IN GREECE.    Two ethnic Macedonian  human rights activists will  face trial in  Athens for alleged crimes against the Greek state, according to a  Court Summons (No. 5445) obtained by MILS.      Hristos  Sideropoulos and  Tashko Bulev  (or Anastasios  Bulis)  have been charged under Greek criminal law for making comments in  an Athenian magazine.      Sideropoulos and  Bulev gave an  interview to the  Greek weekly  magazine  ""ENA""  on  March  11,  1992,  and  said  that  they  as  Macedonians were  denied basic human  rights in Greece  and would  field  an ethnic  Macedonian  candidate for  the up-coming  Greek  general election.      Bulev said in the interview: ""I am not Greek, I am Macedonian.""  Sideropoulos said  in the  article that ""Greece  should recognise  Macedonia.  The  allegations  regarding  territorial  aspirations  against  Greece are  tales... We  are in  a panic  to secure  the  border, at  a time when the  borders and barriers within  the EEC  are falling.""      The  main  charge  against  the two,  according  to  the  court  summons,  was   that  ""they  have   spread...intentionally  false  information  which  might  create   unrest  and  fear  among  the  citizens,  and  might affect  the  public  security or  harm  the  international interests of the country (Greece).""      The  Greek  state  does  not   recognise  the  existence  of  a  Macedonian ethnicity. There are believed to be between 350,000 to  1,000,000  ethnic  Macedonians   living  within  Greece,  largely  concentrated in the north. It is  a crime against the Greek state  if anyone declares themselves Macedonian.      In  1913  Greece,   Serbia-Yugoslavia  and  Bulgaria  partioned  Macedonia into three  pieces. In 1919 Albania  took 50 Macedonian  villages. The part under  Serbo-Yugoslav occupation broke away in  1991  as the  independent Republic  of Macedonia.  There are  1.5  million Macedonians in the Republic; 500,000 in Bulgaria; 150,000  in Albania; and 300,000 in Serbia proper.      Sideropoulos  has been  a long  time campaigner  for Macedonian  human rights in  Greece, and lost his job as  a forestry worker a  few years ago.  He was even exiled to an  obscure Greek island in  the mediteranean. Only pressure from Amnesty International forced  the Greek government  to allow him to return to  his home town of  Florina (Lerin) in Northern  Greece (Aegean Macedonia), where the  majority of ethnic Macedonians live.      Balkan watchers see the Sideropoulos  affair as a show trial in  which  Greece is  desperate to  clamp down  on internal  dissent,  especially  when it  comes to  the issue  of recognition  for its  northern neighbour, the Republic of Macedonia.      Last year the  State Department of the  United States condemned  Greece for its bad treatment of ethnic Macedonians and Turks (who  largely live in Western Thrace). But it remains to be seen if the  US government  will do anything until  the Presidential elections  are over.    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                    (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                             'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                               a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)   "

I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons  that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of  reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds).    (And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way  back when it was only on sci.space).    For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus  would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit  of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the  part of proponents.    Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been  levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light  pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the  target area.    You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites.  I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that  SPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied  opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types.    #2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested  recently.  While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that  any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of  these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be  concerned, and something any project like that would work against  anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's  going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much  dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find  many activists in Murmansk demanding the ""natural"" sky back. If anything,  he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp,  making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the ""day.""    The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass  advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of  those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't  have lived without before.

Very little acne as a teenager. I  didn't have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it  really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry.     Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp  thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under  the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day  vitamin/mineral might help. I've heard iodine causes trouble and that it    is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be  where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease   on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating  meat).    Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm  water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will  help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it  softens and washes off when it has a chance. That's why hair goes limp with  oilyness.     Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with  a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any  prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of  pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't  be an infection afterwards.    Tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry  makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an  incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).       -Jackie-     "

0,"    >This thread brings up the more general question.  Can any crypto  >implementation for which highly publicly scrutinized source code is not  >available EVER be trusted?    After IBM had invented the DES and the NBS had advertised for proposals,  but before IBM had decided to respond, I argued strenuously that they   should not; they should keep it proprietary.     The biggest proponent of proposing was Dr. Lewis Branscomb.  Dr. Branscomb  was the IBM Chief Scientist and had come to IBM from NBS.  Fortunately  for all of us, Dr. Branscomb understood the answer to the above question  much better than I.  He realized how difficult it would be to gain  acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism.  Because of the necessary  complexity, publicity would not be sufficient and neither would   authority.  In fact, it has taken both of those plus more than 15   years.    We have also had independence.  The DES was solicited by NBS, invented  and proposed by IBM, and vetted by NBS.  It has also been examined and  vetted by experts like Adi Shamir, who are not subject to influence by  any of these.    Even now, there are still people posting on this list who do not trust  the DES in spite of all the time, all of the analysis, and all of the  public scrutiny.    (Of course, it is just this point that NIST misses when it attempts to   gain acceptance for a novel mechanism, developed in secret, on the basis  of authority alone.)    We had a long thread here about whether or not the NSA can ""break"" the  DES.  That is a silly question.  At some cost and in some time they  can ""break"" anything.  The important question is at what cost and in  what time.    The fundamental strength of the DES and RSA are not nearly so important  as what we know about their strength.  As long as we understand the  cost and duration for an attacker, then we can use them in a safe way.  At this point, we may never replace either because of the inability of  any successor to overcome this knowledge gap.    DES and RSA are among the most significant inventions of the century  and the most important inventions in the history of cryptography.  We are damned lucky to have them.

It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with  some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec)  into 4800 baud. However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual  proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly  reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a  CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to  spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy  -- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code  without having beaten on it for a very very long time first.     DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this  problem.    --  Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com  --  Laissez faire, laissez passer. Le monde va de lui meme. "

The Denver Post finds that the use of assault  weapons poses a threat to the health, safety, and security of its readers.    \end{quote}    Now I suppose the Post is within its rights to refuse such ads.  However,  the second sentence is so noxious, I feel compelled to bring it to the   attention of the t.p.g/c.g readership.      I called the Post classified number (825-2525) and expressed my displeasure.   According to the supervisor I spoke to, the Post was reacting to public  complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads.  However, she said  the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy.  I   strongly encourage Denver Post readers to call and make their feelings known.    Eric E.

That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled.  Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser  gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers  who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on  self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the  data on computer disk.    The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will  notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called  a ""bingo card"" in the industry) includes lines for a company name  and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national  advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as  best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company  and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably  send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer  call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they  will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail  outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th  e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have  nothing to mail out accept the catalog.    A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry  magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They  use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read  the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push  you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile  how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics.  This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that ""23% of readers  requesting data were interested in capacitors."" And finally, some  magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For  example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information  about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.    The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines  include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the  advertiser can attempt to cull out the ""literature collectors"" from  the serious potential customers.    ""Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.""    What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?      Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more    than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of    weeks later.      If you are really, really serious and you really, really want    the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also    cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually    everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data    on a computer printout.      To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're    not really ""qualified"" for, send in a bingo card at least every    other month and circle two or three numbers.      Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.    Advertisers almost never call.

You seem to be saying that a LIMITED government will provide MORE  opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own  agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will NOT happen.  While I can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that  if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become  a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.  I rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have NOW that is  more likely to become such a tool, and that it IS such a tool in many  instances.    >Just  >as Marxism ""fails"" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and  >the state is to ""wither away,"" libertarians frequently fail to show how  >weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human  >condition.

[PTS] ----------------------------------------------------------------------  [PTS]   [PTS]   [PTS]       The Conflict Over Nagorno-Karabakh: An Azeri Perspective  [PTS]       --------------------------------------------------------  [PTS]                            By Alec Rasizade  [PTS]   [PTS]     [AR] Western readers have learned of the Nagorno (Upper) Karabakh  [AR] controversy through reports from that remote area by Western  [AR] correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long-established  [AR] Armenian-American community.  Azeri views on this dispute have  [AR] appeared rarely if at all in the Western news media.  Therefore let me  [AR] present _Washington Report_ readers with some basic truths about the  [AR] origins of the conflict.    During the past two years, if one reads all the commentaries on the subject,  a small minority of the writers have been Armenia or Azeri.    The following should be interesting.     [AR] Armenian leaders claim that Azerbaijan was the first to oppress and  [AR] expel the Armenian minority from the Azerbaijani Republic.  Actually,  [AR] the initiative to banish the Azeri minority and convert the Armenian  [AR] Republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987-1988,  [AR] when 165,000 Azeris were driven out of Armenia.  Following that move,  [AR] there were massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani cities of Sumgait  [AR]in February 1988 and two years later, in Baku in January 1990.    This not true. Other than simply checking the newspapers, I will quote from an  independent human rights report. In the _PAX Cristi Netherlands_, 29 September  1991, page 28, we read:     ""By mid-november, many incidents took place in several places in    Azerbaijan. The APF [Azeri Popular Front] challenged the Communist Party    for power. ... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to    reimpose their power. In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were    deported. In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed. All 40,000     Armenian inhabitants fled the city...""      Between 22 November and 8 December 1988, refugees from Ganja arrived in    Armenia while all 167,000 Azeris in Armenia were chased away.""    In this part of the world February 1988 [start of organized anti-Armenian   pogroms in Azerbaijan] come before November and December of 1988!    [AR] Azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that  [AR] both events were inspired from Moscow to secure Russian imperial rule  [AR] in the Transcaucasus, according to the Roman principle of ""divide and  [AR] rule.""  Similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five-year  [AR] history of the conflict.    It is interesting that the Azeris killed, burnt, raped the Armenians but the  perpetrators blame Russians, and Armenians themselves on other occasions.     [AR] Each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in  [AR] Zheleznovodsk, Moscow, Tehran, Rome, Geneva and Alma-Ata), an  [AR] invisible hand provoked further bloodshed.  Those interested in  [AR] maintaining the Azeri-Armenian conflict, as well as the Georgian  [AR] turmoil, are imperialist forces in Russia, and probably in Iran.    Incorrect! When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in an  agreement? Never. Until Azerbaijan sits down with the Armenians of Nagorno-  Karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.     [AR] The Armenian offensive last spring created more than 100,000 new Azeri  [AR] refugees from the captured towns of Upper and Lower Karabakh and  [AR] adjacent rural districts.  Today 500,000 Azeri refugees throng the  [AR] city of Baku and environs, providing more problems for the newly  [AR] elected Popular Front government, which is opposed by the rigidly  [AR] nationalistic National Independence Party.     It's called war. If the Azerbaijanis didn't try to deport and allow the   Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live in their ways, keep their Armenian  culture, these Armenians would not have had to defend their existence. The  Azeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over and  play dead.     [AR] How can a Western-style democracy survive in a small Muslim country  [AR] where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed?  In the  [AR] absence of any international effort to help Azeri refugees, as Kurdish  [AR] and Bosnian refugees have been helped, how can the Azeri government  [AR] reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands, homes and  [AR] possessions?    The Azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they  attempted to deprive Armenians of ""lands, homes, and possessions"".     [AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.  [AR] Misunderstanding Caucasian politics leads both Western and Russian  [AR] public opinion to imagine a permanent, and therefore irreversible,  [AR] ethnic and religious rivalry in the Caucasus.    True, and you, Dr. Alec Rasizade, should practice what you preach!     [AR] I think Western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.  [AR] Meanwhile, continuation of the war could draw both Eastern and Western  [AR] states into the conflict through activation of various security  [AR] alliances.  These include, on the Armenian side, the Moscow-led  [AR] Commonwealth forces under the Tashkent mutual security pact, signed  [AR] May 15, 1992.  On the Azeri side, should Turkey get involved as the  [AR] guarantor of the Nakhichevan autonomy through the Kars Treaty of Oct.  [AR] 13, 1921, these include the North Atlantic Treaty forces.    Western interference! Turkish intervention! The moment Turkey dares step into  this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of Turkey being part of   Europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of Anatolia!  Dr. Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you would  have us believe.     [AR] Upper Karabakh generally is described in Western press reports as an  [AR]""Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan.""  The truth is that the Armenians  [AR] began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.    Incorrect once again. A brief scan of history addresses such a foolish  claim.     Armenians today, refer to the area of Nagorno-Karabakh as ""Artsakh"", which   comes from the Urartian term ""Urtekhe-Urtekhini"". NO Azeris yet!     Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as ""Orkhistena"". NO Azeris yet!    In the first half of the 6th century B.C., Artsakh, as part of Ervandid  Armenia of Media. NO Azeris yet!    From the end of the 4th century B.C., Artsakh was part of the Armenian Kingdom  of Ervan. NO Azeris yet!    Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran. Orkhistena, or   Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!    After Armenia was divided between the Persian and Byzantine Empires in 387   A.D. until 428, Artsakh was part of Armenia. NO Azeris yet!    End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the   Aranshakhiks. NO Azeris yet!    By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed. NO Azeris yet!    Emperor Konstantin (913-959) addressees a letter to the Prince of Khachen ""To  Armenia"". Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh. NO Azeris yet!    In the decree of Paul I (1797), the number of Armenian families in this area  was stated as 11,000.    It was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non-Armenians from Central  Asia, Asia Minor, and Kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence  in the planes of Artsakh. Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!    In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia. Officiallt part of Russia 1828. Some   Muslims in Karabakh!    In 1914, the number of Armenian churches in Nagorno-Karabagh was 224, 188  priests, 206,768 parishioners in 224 Armenian towns and villages. The Armenian  percentage of the population was over 90%. MAX: 10% Azeris in Karabakh --  assuming no Kurds!    Consider the following statement by the Azerbaijani Revcom on December 1, 1920:     ""The Worker-Peasant Government of Azerbaidzan, having been informed of the    proclamation of Armenia a Soviet Socialist Republic, sends its greetings    to the brother people. From this day the previous boundaries between    Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled. Nagornyi Karabakh, Zangezur, and    Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Armenian Socialis    Republic.      Long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of Soviet    Armenia and Azerbaidzan!    				Chairman of the Revcom of Azerbaidzan  							N. Narimanov    				People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs  							Guseinov""    [AR] A few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their  [AR] resettlement from Persia to Karabakh, after it came under Russian  [AR] rule.     No, incorrect. The 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of Russian rule  in the Caucasus, including Karabakh!    [AR] At the same time the Russian colonial administration also drew  [AR] in Russian and German settlers, who were welcomed by Azeris.  How  [AR] would Americans react if the large numbers of Armenians living in  [AR] southern California suddenly claimed an Armenian homeland, and  [AR] demanded separation from California?    Non-sequitur.      [AR] Armenian historians insist that before the Armenian resettlement  [AR] Karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal Christians.  That is correct.    Armenian historians don't say this!    [AR] The people of medieval Caucasian Albania adopted Christianity in the  [AR] fourth century.  But those ancient residents had no link to and  [AR] nothing in common with Armenians.    Considering the Caucasian Albans were of the Armenian Apostolic faith, and  their utilization of the Armenian language in their liturgy, makes such an   argument totally invalid!    [AR] Azeris would have a better claim to  [AR] be successors of Albania, since Azeris have for centuries inhabited,  [AR] dominated, and developed the Karabakh part of the Azeri nation.    Wishing to be part of a people non-existent for nearly a millennium for geo-  political advantage is rather outrageous. In addition to such absurdity,  Azeris claim to be Turks, Persians, and all the while are Azerizing their  minorities, such as the Lezgians, Kurds, Tat, Talish, and a host of other  nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of Azerbaijan.    [AR] Both Armenia and Azerbaijan last year signed the Final Act of the  [AR] Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975, and the  [AR] Paris Charter for New Europe of 1990, confirming their mutual  [AR] adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders.  This  [AR] principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the  [AR] Republic of Azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory  [AR] nations, not just by Turkey.    Such agreements do not give Azerbaijan the right to de-populate Karabakh of  Armenians.     [AR] This is one key to intervention on behalf either of the U.N., the  [AR] CSCE, the Commonwealth, NATO or Iran.  The second key to untying the  [AR] Caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor, according to the  [AR] U.N. definition of 1974.    Fine, so why has Azerbaijan refused to allow UN troops into the Armenian  enclave? What is Azerbaijan afraid of? Perhaps the fact that the territory  is the home of Armenians, the UN, would by definition, support the local  population!      [AR] When that is accomplished, the international community can and should  [AR] apply to the aggressor in the Caucasus international sanctions such as  [AR] those presently being employed against Serbia and Montenegro in the  [AR] former Yugoslavia.  Such decisive collective international action can  [AR] halt further aggression in Karabakh, and prevent the Armenian-Azeri  [AR] conflict from growing and spreading.     Azerbaijan's refusal to allow the Armenians of Karabakh to determine their  own future the is issue, not viewing isolating events out of context are   actions that will address the Karabakh conflict. Viewing events in a war  in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at Normandy as  an act of Allied aggression!

Where a person looks in their  memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc Another type is related to  coordination activities like hitting a ball. Another for reading.

Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are     quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?       Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?       Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the  gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that  GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population  (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic  halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)  (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was  probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)  	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo  population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is  ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you  have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism  of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start  to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.  	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution  (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with  the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence  isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-)  If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)  and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star  colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting  the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.    	If we know anything about physics at that level,  the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic  strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.    The situation is further complicated by recent claims that  there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS  they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the  NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]       my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering     hyperspace :-)       but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they     are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered     if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

1,"  This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.  =============================================================  Hi Folks;    Thursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.    This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy  U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.    The short version is that his testimony was consistent with  the opening statements for the prosecution.    Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)  on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation  with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was  using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up  into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an  observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies  Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to  scout further possible surveillance sites.    Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into  a gully to see, ""whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.""  Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking  loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.    They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the  ""fern field""] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin  Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance  team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should  take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy  target and might be ""shot in the back.""    As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the  road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.    At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to ""fend  him off with his gun.""  [It is unclear whether this means he  clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then  took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and  Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not  noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan  got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, ""Stop!  U.S.  Marshal!""  Harris then ""...brought the weapon around at hip level  and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw  Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.""  Cooper fired  at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon  to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then  heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the  direction of the shots, yelled, ""You son of a bitch!"" and ran  toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him  from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the  cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward  the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two  fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and  then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the  other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large  burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.    On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of  throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, ""You wanted to lure that  dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?""  Nevin also  pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had  claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.  Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and  decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the  cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an  armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at  him [no answer was available].    Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.    Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

We have a name  here that implies certain things to many people.

My dad was a lawyer -- as such I grew up with being a stickler  for ""meaning"".  In my ""reality"", psychoactives *technically* could   range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more  standard recreational drugs.  In practice I had hoped to see it  limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like  some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*  recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive   effects -- the recent query about ""bong water"", I thought was a bit  off topic -- so I just hit ""k"".    	But back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --  what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to  discuss?  It sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something  similar -- I don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to  describe alot of those drugs.  There is a big difference between a  drug that if taken in ""certain doses, over a period of days may have  a psychoactive effect in some people"", vs. many of the drugs in  PIHKAH which *are* psychoactive.      wm  --     :: If pro-choice means choice after conception, does this apply to men too? :: "

Try not to take it so personally.    Look, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant.  I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last  name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.    What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from  a recent FDA hearing:               ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect  on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute  of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is  ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate  has made them sick.''    And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double  blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also  had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.    Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group,  some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG  emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.     My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably  20-1 outnumbered.

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,   Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.   Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First   World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse   to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other   invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian   success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of   Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common   soldiers began deserting in droves.""    ""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of   World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy   increased drastically. Ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,   Armenian revolutionaries armed Armenian civil populations, who in turn   massacred the Muslim population of the province of Van in anticipation of   expected arrival of the invading Russian armies.""    ""...Meanwhile, Czar Nicholas II himself came to the Caucasus to make final   plans for cooperation with the Armenians against the Ottomans, with the    president of the Armenian National Bureau in Tiflis declaring in response:     'From all countries Armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the     glorious Russian Army, with their blood to serve the victory of Russian    arms...Let the Russian flag wave freely over the Dardanelles and the    Bosporus. Let, with Your will, great Majesty, the peoples remaining    under the Turkish yoke receive freedom. Let the Armenian people of Turkey    who have suffered for the faith of Christ receive resurrection for a new    free life under the protection of Russia.'[155]    Armenians again flooded into the czarist armies.

I went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. The   entire Turkish population of Armenia (which Armenians called Tartars)   constituted at least about 40% of the total population of Armenia   was deliberately exterminated. (For the population statistics, please   look to the book of Richard Hovannessian, ""Armenia on the Road to   Independence."") I listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime   by the writings of one Armenian, one American, and one British. They   are: ""Men Are Like That"" by Leonard R. Hartill; ""Adventures in the Near   East"" by A. Rawlinson; ""World Alive, A Personal Story"" by Robert Dunn.   Also, I personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings   of two Armenians and also one American. The official British report about   this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (Lord Curzon-Aharonin   interview) is the report of the British High Commissioner to Caucasia,   Sir Oliver Wardrop.      ""An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the   systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of    the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at    least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The    memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and    eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in   1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.' Other references abound.""       (Rachel A. Bortnick - The Jewish Times - June 21, 1990)    Need I go on?    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can   engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order   harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a   satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of   months to years.          My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT   satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In   particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in   altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude   of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18   March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the   limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.)         This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71   degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is   unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But   it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the   situation.         (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

The Wall Street Journal had an article on how the police were whining  about all the new guns; excuse me, but police are EMPLOYEES of the  government. Rather like having your janitor complain about job  conditions.    I say Californians should form armed block clubs that would engage  in coordinated strategies should BATF attempt to disarm them based  on the ""nefarious tipster"" theory of law enforcement. Unlike Waco,   Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city  streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down  with abandoned car blockades. M-1 Garands should easily outclass  BATF shock troops with their H&K MP-5 SMGs, and there should be  enough Sony Walkmans and Boom Boxes to overwhelm any FBI psy-war  operation... yes, a good time would be had by all. Billary Clinton  would get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attempt  to show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in charge  with a 500-man ""Charge of the Light Brigade,"" and the FBI would attempt   to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian   National Guard to level the area with artillary!    :-) :-) :-) "

Through a unique iteration involving the 4th-dimensional projection of  a torus through the semi-stochastic interactions of hot monomolecular  lipid layers covering the metal plates (the best metal is iron since  it repels Vampires and Succubi) the donuts start developing flutes,  and within moments actually become poly-crenellated hot greasy  breadtubes.

1,"  >Hell, a Glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  The only thing  >that I know about a Glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  Sure there is  >that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.    You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be  depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned  thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just  about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is  functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working  correctly is totally drop safe.    Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single  documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because  he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few  documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't  figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the  proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely  prevented the office from getting shot.    The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.  This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down  intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a  'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the  standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.  By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.  From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a  revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of  firing it.    The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that  the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the  wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be  familiar with that particular type of firearm.

Agreed. No agency such as the NSA (or whoever) would approve the public   release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technical  means or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. Surely the whole  point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/her  communications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if need  be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications? That'll be  quite a heist, if they can pull it off.

The  detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar   detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there   are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't   paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the  roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.     I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and   how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector   in a proper RF shielded enclosure.    --   Andrew Daviel, Vancouver, Canada <advax@triumf.ca>    finger advax@reg.triumf.ca for PGP key "

If we are indeed talking about CS, then this is not quite accurate. CS is  ""just"" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. It isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't  have direct CNS effects. However, it's quite bad--much worse than CN gas. I  was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in Berkeley circa 1968  8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. It seems to be  moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked  my breathing passages and lungs. Breathing was painful, and my entire face  felt as if it was on fire. These effects persisted for hours after  exposure, and I was coughing for days afterwards.  If I was exposed to a  dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, I  doubt whether I could find the exit.

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung   disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side  -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also   binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when   EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that   were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove   calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C   and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra   vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium   from the plaques).    The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably   can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns   with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.    	1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review""  	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with   	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels.     	2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular   	    disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the   	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be   	    overemphasized.  This is a review article.    	3. ""Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis   	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits"" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).    	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of   	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol   	   added to their normal food.    Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for   the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.    Marty B. "

2,"  I've recently listened to a tape by Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, in which he   claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti-  cancer properties that he names antineoplastons.  Burzynski says that his   work has met with hostility in the United States, despite the favorable   responses of his subjects during clinical trials.    What is the generally accepted opinion of Dr. Burzynski's research?  He   paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an   intolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge   his claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH's Department of   Alternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski's   work.  Their budget is so small that I imagine they wouldn't investigate a   treatment that didn't seem promising.    Any opinions on Burzynski's antineoplastons or information about the current   status of his research would be appreciated.    --  Joshua Schwimmer  jschwimmer@eagle.wesleyan.edu "

2,"  If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be  there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt  supply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  The  regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits  shut down the EHT supply section.    Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lower  the AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the set  operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.    There are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the one  above several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the trippler  module may be shot; that's fairly common.      --   Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department  Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511  wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED "

0,"  If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against  using other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous  class of crime is created.    Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically  the terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats)  will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and  to kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the  device will be delayed.    Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate  with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from  key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.    Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal  very large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume  that they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous  property (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with  ""blue box"" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,  we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for  stolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes  criminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen  instruments.    Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,  a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a  continuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.    In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a  current inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and  persistent threat to the general public.    On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a  device in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least  stand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.    Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in  realtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,  there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications  in the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,  and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording and  archiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasible  across the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of these  recordings could open up vast potential for abuse.    Brad Yearwood    brad@optilink.com     {uunet, pyramid}!optilink!brad  Petaluma, CA   "

It works for any situation.  If you believe the market is going up,  don't sell.    	If believe it's not, sell.  But then you'd be selling anyways, wouldn't  you?

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD       On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National   Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-  inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.  Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science  Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.       Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space  Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell  International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world  authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or  coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial  materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David  Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.       Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal  experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build  the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a  potential to power the globe.       For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half  from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific  concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.       The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar  surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted  through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous  source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever  increasing demand using proven, basic technology.       OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space  Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the  National Space Society, which is an international non-profit  organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

2,"Nntp-Posting-Host: troi.cc.rochester.edu    Does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in  combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of   available water?  I had kind of an odd experience on a group hike  recently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous  hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).  I drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was  dehydrated.  I don't think general physical condition was an issue,  since I was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general  stamina, so far as I could tell.    It may be that I just plain need more water than most people.  But I am  wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things.  I took a couple of Primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma  (24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  I gather that both those  drugs are diuretics.  So now I'm wondering: does that mean they can  reduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  Would it be a  particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather  exercise?  (I always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, but  that wasn't the case yesterday.) "

1,"  It is appropriate to add what Himmler said other ""inferior races""   and ""human animals"" in his speech at Posen and elsewhere:      From the speech of Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler, before SS  Major-Generals, Posen, October 4 1943  [""Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression"", Vol. IV, p. 559]  -------------------------------------------------------------------  One basic principal must be the absolute rule for the SS man: we  must be honest, decent, loyal, and comradely to members of our own  blood and to nobody else. What happens to a Russian, to a Czech,  does not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer  in good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping  their children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in  prosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we  need them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest  to me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion  while digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as  the anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough  and heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans,  who are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude  towards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these  human animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry  about them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and  grandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone  comes to me and says, ""I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women  and children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them"", then I  would have to say, ""you are a murderer of your own blood because  if the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and  they are the sons of German mothers. They are our own blood"".        Extract from Himmler's address to party comrades, September 7 1940  [""Trials of Wa Criminals"", Vol. IV, p. 1140]  ------------------------------------------------------------------  If any Pole has any sexual dealing with a German woman, and by this  I mean sexual intercourse, then the man will be hanged right in  front of his camp. Then the others will not do it. Besides,  provisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women  and girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this  kind is out of the question.    The women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and  where the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline  cases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.  This we must do, unless these one million Poles and those  hundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict  untold damage on the German blood. Philosophizing is of no avail  in this case. It would be better if we did not have them at all -  we all know that - but we need them.        -Danny Keren.   "

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to  have a ""dirty"" amp.       Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,     that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs    Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for  just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow  down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.       for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt     radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet      away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.     If you experience the problem frequently, it may be      caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station     nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio      transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,     etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are     correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.       If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite     chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably     being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can     be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).     Good instructions are included with the chokes.     If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your     neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof     or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things     a radio operator can do to reduce interference.    And please remember to be friendly when approaching your  local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the   cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation  and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most  are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes  dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost  pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.  interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.      BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or  not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of  being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.  Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers  to take any precautions.    Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are  required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more  than 10).  So if you hear ""This is WA1QT"" or some other call starting  with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.  CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required  to) and fire/police have other private ids.              --  Douglas S. Rand <drand@osf.org>		OSF/Motif Dev.

1,"Message-ID: <1ra7f7INNc74@dns1.NMSU.Edu>  NNTP-Posting-Host: kazak.nmsu.edu  X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]      The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article  on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal  tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.  type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,  and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.  The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student  (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...    (The title was the only thing they changed/added)    ""Gun Stats""    The Daily recently reprinted an article from the  Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton  Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article,  in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally  reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The  article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home  was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,  spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This  is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-  eral reasons, outlined below:    The study gives the impression that, if you own a   gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to   defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned  against you.  The study, however, fails to take into  account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun   to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-  trator.    The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather  than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-  borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every  month, the second your grandmother cashes her social  security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a  friend.    The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-  position of cases and fails to take into account cases  originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be  self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample   size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-  stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.    Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-  erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be   used, successfully, by a private citizen against an   aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-  sons defending themselves from aggression by using a   gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by  some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.  Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies   also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be  used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat  than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times  more likely to be used to defend against a criminal  threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times  more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be  used to commit suicide.    It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can   be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has  to consider carefully what questions were asked by  those gathering the data before one can draw an accu-  rate conclusion from them.    D.F.

First of all, even if you identify  yourself as completely Jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're  a self-hating anti-semite.

2,"  Does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly?  Does   short-term use of the drug ever produce long-term side-effects after  the use of the drug?  My grandmother recently had to be hospitalized  and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks.  Although the  drug has been terminated, she has changed from a perky, slightly  senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone  and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance.  It  seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the  course of just one and one-half months.  I have to believe that the  combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part  catalysts for this.  Any comments?    --   Will Estes		Internet: westes@netcom.com "

Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel  reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift  astronaut or something like that).

Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf  item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include  attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things  like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro  data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you  don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible  contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get  to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is  done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for  the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from  thrusters and the like).    The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the  reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well  suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing  a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was  relatively short, so it got cancelled.  --   SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology  between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry "

Okay, it looks like I am going to have to do the history lesson after all.    During the Vietnam war, there were a great many citizens opposed to it  who considered themselves perfectly law abiding, although Mr. Nixon and  his lackeys thought otherwise.    The Federal government had no compunction about adding ""people who  are otherwise decent, law abiding and upstanding, but disagree with  us"" to your nice little list. Do you think this could never happen  again?

This is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid  purpose for infringing a patent.  Although it is clear that in order to  create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing  a prior patent, one must perform research on an existing patent.  To  just say that you infringed a patent (assume we're not talking the RSA  patent) only for research purposes (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then never  develop any related invention (ie. only use it), would be a clear  infringement.    --   Glenn Tenney  voice: (415) 574-3420      fax: (415) 574-0546  tenney@netcom.com          Ham radio: AA6ER "

From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about  ""High Power Rocketry"", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby  uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured  engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby  has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular.  Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.    Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a  total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch.  Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period  of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and  all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"".  There is also a ""High Power Safety Code"" which designates more  specific rules such as launch field size, etc.    Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket   motors you need to certified through either the National Association  of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures  require a demonstarted handling and ""safe"" flight at a total impulse  level.    For more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup.    R.

As I read the current wiretap law, it would not be legal now.  On the  other hand, assuming a legislative change, recording but not decrypting  Clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the Supreme  Court, using the same reasoning (or the lack thereof...) by which they  permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers.    Incidentally, if we use that as our model, the Court will likely not  uphold selective recording.  (On the other hand, I don't think they've  thrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet.  Must be that exception to  the Fourth Amendment that I can never find in my copy of the Bill of  Rights.)    A lot -- and I mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how Clippertaps  (or Tipperclaps, for encrypted music?) are used.  Don Alvarez showed in  the latest RISKS digest that it's possible to prevent the cops from  reading traffic after their warrant expires.    That is -- the cops send the LEF to the F-holder.  The F-holder strips  off F, and sends U[K],N to the escrow agents.  They send either U or K  to the cops.  (Don says U, I say K.)  The cops can't use U in the  future, because they can't strip off F.  The F-holder never sees U.  In  Don's model, the escrow agents can't read the traffic, because they  don't have K; in my model, they have K, but not the message itself.  And I trust that more because I think the cops and the FBI (the  F-holder) are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules.  The  net result is that by involving the F-holder and the escrow agents on  every tap, we can avoid extending permission to tap. "

(And I'm not entirely joking about  > those two names)    The problem with ""Let's assume"" reasoning is that, taken to the extreme  (and you're close), you arrive at ""Let's assume this is perfectly OK.""    The assumptions you make are big ones. If the system is really secure, then  why does the government have to keep the algorithm secret?  There are plenty  of encryption algorithms that don't depend upon nondisclosure to be secure,  so why in the world use one that does?  There are reasons, of course, but  I certainly can't think of any honest ones.    Next, you assume we can ""trust"" the escrow houses. But the last time I checked,  EVERY SINGLE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT has experienced unauthorized disclosure,  corruption, and even fabrication, of supposedly secure data. The govt is  saying ""Yeah, but NOW we're serious, so you can trust us.""  Bullcrypt.     And finally, although you didn't state it explicitly, you implicitly assume  that the warrant mechanism in this country is safe and reasonable. The case  in Ventura County of a man shot and killed by officers serving a deliberately  fraudulant warrant tells me that the govt has a long ways to go on this  score.    Remember that all this is to catch the drug dealers, right?  As others  have pointed out, the current proposal will, if deployed, render truly secure  encryption much more expensive and inconvenient than Uncle Sam's brand.

0,"  It occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow  houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.    It's in the hands of cops, and while I am sure most of the time they are  good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.      What this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you,  at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that  a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your  cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the  escrow houses.    Do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are  laid?   In many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to.  Judges set time limits on warrants, I assume.  At the end of the time  limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.      That's if we go with this scheme, which I am not sure I agree with.  --   Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366 "

Well, what American private insurance plans cover travel expenses???    Since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable, one can  raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which  one is entitled (hey, not Alberta's fault that he lives there) ...   If he lived in Cheyenne, WY his private insurance would've told him  to go to hell for the travel expenses and that's that.

It's worth thinking about.    It's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get  at what facilities.  Don't Americans have to arrange in advance for  operations too?  I think that there are two standards being applied  here, and that Canada can't give Beverly Hills-style treatment to  everybody.  It's not a big brother list ... it's more like calling  around town for a table for dinner ...    >Yeah, but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow,   >especially in the hospital business.     Yes, and the Tories in Ottawa are trying to make them do that rather  than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the   next time around.  Whether it's using mop a couple of weeks longer  or even selling services to Americans (remember, our system is cash  based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except  in specialties that require larger populations to generate business,  why not?  The alternative is closing unused wards ... business.).    >whether Canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own   >health services catering toward Americans, who would be willing   >to pay more than they do, is another issue entirely), it must be   >noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants   >from the province were getting smaller If those grants are so   >insubstantial, why the need to attract foreigners to make up the   >difference?    You answered the question yourself ... ""private nonprofit foundations  have to make money somehow"", and I think that it's about time that  they acted like the private hospitals that they are.  Personally,  I'm fed up with Canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that  their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance  (that's one at you, Bob Rae!!).    >>The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures for total  >>outlay, and  are compiled use the same methods by the OECD that yield   >>the 13-14% figure for the U.S.  >  >But don't the US figures include dentistry and optometry where the   >Canadian one (until recently, anyway) didn't?    Since we have always been evaluated in an OECD style, I don't see  how ... remember, OECD counts both private and public funds, and  in Canada like France and Germany, 30% of health care spending is  private funds (i.e., not the basic health insurance money).    >>>So what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.  >>   >>How?

Remember that our ""system""  is only an insurance policy.  But our costs aren't rising fast  enough to ensure adequate copayments/deductibles ... last year,  Quebec's user-fee proposal came out with the number of ""$5"" as  the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather  than give the QMA a raise.  And it's not contract time yet, as  far as I can tell from UPI Clarinet ...    Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of traditionalists from the  Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian"" faction, holds our public  health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to  be reminded that it's not free (the average Canadian/European is more  fiscally naive than their American counterparts on issues like these).  But no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting public  spending all over the place, and bringing back the death penalty, with  little haste if elected.    >I know that, for Pete's sake, I live right on the border.

Yeah, but there'd be a lot of lead-time and a health-care crisis that  would preclude it.  If provincial governments (as bad as some of them  are; heck, we have the NDP cleaning up a spending mess made by the  Conservatives in Saskatchewan - embarassing!) can be so irresponsible,  there is still reallocation --- health insurance is so important that  it's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent  insurrection outside of the hockey rink.  Right now, attempts to get  the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like  cod-liver oil ...    >>>Would the private insurers take up the slack?

Most Americans are fearful of a single-tier system ... (-;    Seriously, there are few areas that have sufficient population for a  two/more-tiered system like what the French have ... a health policy  prof, D.G. Shea, has cited studies in the NEJM that indicate having  a population of 500,000 is necessary for adequate competition ...  and in Canada, there are only four cities west of the Great Lakes  with that population or larger.    Anyways, the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those  in the U.S. and barring any future Chernobyl-like crisis, sudden  transients in spending are unlikely.  In fact, the health allocation  is one of the most well-behaved sectors of spending up north so any  talk of bankruptcy is talk-radio fodder far away from the border.    >If the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back, the  >things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like  >luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable.    This won't be overnight, and something like this would force Canada  to have a system more like the French one ... but that's not a bad  thing, and the change will be minimal (i.e., add copayments and  frustrate the socialists chanting ""Hey, it's *free*!"").    gld  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Gary L.

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.    The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced,  translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this  does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying  their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But  it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that  the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own  diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.    Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning  that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for  him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone  else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is  not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages  a court would award.    However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit,  almost certainly it is ""obvious to one skilled in the art"" and therefore  unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory)  cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.    Caution:  I am not a lawyer.

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate  project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars  in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop  your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against  your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.

You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch  system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on  exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project  start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,  the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want  speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in  service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less  than 18 months after the development go-ahead.    One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief  that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending  billions of dollars.  It isn't true and never was. "

""... anabolic steroids"" - I have also never heard of this claim  before.  Sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth  for God knows what reason.  Did somebody piss you off at one time?        |>  On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place  |> bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...        I agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely  to make a fat person thin.  But it can be the decisive component  of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an  important contribution to good health.  It is important to  exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).    Chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase  lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the  statistics.  You wouldn't believe these anyway.    Chromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of  the essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role  in ""sensitizing"" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.  Weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity  to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose  weight (4).    Insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards  protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This ""protein sparing""  effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets  as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle  and organ tissue.  By ""sensitizing"" muscle to insulin,  chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters  so that they ""burn"" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation  of lean body mass has an important long-term positive  effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the  fat they've lost.    Chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding  the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.  Insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability  of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin   stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say  that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.    In summary, you need to change your life style in order to  loose weight and stay healthy:      A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.       - Eating fat makes you fat.      B. Increase dietary fiber       - low in calories; high in nutrients.      C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week       - burn calories.      D. Take chromium picolinate daily       - lose fat; keep muscle      References:    1.  Kaats GR, Fisher JA, Blum K.

It would seem more logical to say that since   the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity   larger as well.  In my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.    Men are men and they all like sex.  I am a gay male.  I have had sex three   times in my life, all with the same man.  Before that, I was a virgin.    So... whose promiscuous?    Just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  Just because   someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  Look at the world....

2,"  While in grad school, I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with  ""heat shock proteins"". Apparently, burning protein will induce changes in he  DNA. Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion  I don't know, but I never eat burnt food because of this.     Also, many woods contain toxins. As they are burnt, it would seem logical that  some may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I don't know if these  toxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsh  conditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to cross  the intestinal mucosa?    Maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almost  *anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that  may be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQ.

What kind of witnesses?  If we are talking about witnesses who were at  the accident, or were otherwise directly involved (e.g., paramedics,  emergency room doctors, etc.), then they should have been used at the  first trial.  You don't get a new trial because you screwed up and  forgot to call all of your witnesses.    If we are talking about new expert witnesses who will offer new  interpretations of the data, note that the loser can *ALWAYS* find  such witnesses.  If this were grounds for a new trial, then the loser  could *ALWAYS* get a new trial, and keep doing so until the loser  becomes a winner (and then the other side would come up with new  expert witnesses).    --Tim Smith "

1,"    Who wants to look through the bars at some reactionary Liberal conspiracy-  theory idiots and see how they rant and rave at the erosion of their populist   support?  This is very typical of the elitist Liberal attitude that The People   are incapable of thinking for themselves.  This elitist attitude will be the  eventual undoing of the arrogant liberal tide sweeping America, as The People  begin to realize more and more that they are being treated like errant children  and robbed of their freedoms by a bunch of Utopian arrogent socialist jerks.

Although I find myself often disagreeing with the populist rationale  of Mr. Limbaugh, I find him entertaining and I often agree with his   conclusions.

Actually, I find Limbaugh's oratory less than sizzling and his debating  skills sometimes lacking, even though his conclusions are often correct.    I would suggest that a bankrupt leftist ideology that hopes to use concentrated   political power and a loaded gun to force everyone to do the ""right"" things  (where ""right"" is defined by the elitist academics who lead the movement)  is showing an acute case of ""myopic social perspective"", not to mention  arrogance and utter stupidity.    Limbaugh is certainly far from perfect, but his opponents in the established  body politic and the media are the ones arguing for Federal control of  virtually all aspects of the lives of the Citizenry, and for the elimination  of local control over Affairs Public.      Perhaps Limbaugh has a following because The People are tired of being treated   like errant children by a self-important group of arrogant controlling myopic   people who have no understanding of how life operates outside of the ""oughta-be's""  inside their own hopelessly closed minds.        >        The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening   >pages of both books.

Hmmm, ""Congress shall pass no law regarding an establishment of religion,  nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""  Liberal translation: ""the  federal government (as long as it is run by Liberals) may force local  school districts to include certain iconic content in Christmas displays,  while prohibiting others.""    I think Limbaugh has you on this one.  It seems to me that he is arguing  for LESS imposition of the federal government into religion.    Nice job on the specificity of that one, too.

I have read Mr. Limbaugh's book, and although it was not the most literary  piece I have read in recent memory it certainly did not contain ""venom""  at all, let alone ""venom"" comparable to an individual who callously murdered  millions out of racism.        >On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  >        Hitler: ""Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who   >individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly   >perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in   >order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of   >imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight   >for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of   >thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises""   >(page 577).    A very serious tone in that oratory.        >        Limbaugh: ""Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The   >show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase ""with half my   >brain tied behind my back to make it even""] denotes the egress of mental   >aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree   >with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media   >will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking   >and screaming all the way."" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)    You neglect to mention that Mr. Limbaugh (have you ever listened to his show,   BTW?) continuously encourages his audience to think for themselves rather  than blindly following any media icon, himself included.  You yourself mention   that he makes no bones about his show being strictly about his own opinions.  He also adopts a rather satirical approach, and presumes his audience to be  intelligent enough to distinguish satire from seriousness (and he says as much).  This is in contrast to the average mass-media show, in which the audience is  treated as society's intellectual lowest common denominator.    I am sure that Adolf Hitler was a master of satire; I am sure he was just  kidding when he said that the Jews were the cause of Germany's problems and  needed to be exterminated.        >On Religion as the Basis of a Nation  >        Hitler: ""In this world human culture and civilization are   >inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his   >decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without   >culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord   >sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the   >expulsion from Paradise."" (Page 581.)    This is not religion, it is clearly a perverse worship of race.  Since  Christ was a Jew, it seems quite unlikely that Hitler's characterization of  the Aryan as ""the highest image of the Lord"" fits with Christian doctrine.        >        Limbaugh: ""America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...   >But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or   >ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a   >charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools   >for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of   >American education has declined ever since?"" (pages 274-5.)    Private religious schools have a vastly better record of success than  publicly funded schools.  American history is indeed primarily Judeo-  Christian.  I suppose that Mr. Limbaugh pointing out facts is equivalent  to Adolf Hitler worshiping the Aryan race.  I think you might be reaching  just a wee bit here.        >On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse  >        Hitler: ""The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...   >One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and   >theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...   >Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays   >must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the   >service of a moral idea of State and culture."" (pages 346 and 348.)    Definite suggestion that the government should control the entertainment  industry here.      >        Limbaugh: ""Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that   >Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people   >who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality   >and monagamy. They disparage American heroes."" (page 254.)    Just a guess here, but I don't think that Mr. Limbaugh would advocate  government control of Hollywood.  You should perhaps call his radio show  to confirm this.  I believe this is more a criticism of Hollywood and the  depraved moral values it espouses, not an advocation of government control   of Hollywood.    90's Liberals, on the other hand, want to have complete government control   of our school systems, so that the government can teach The People at an  early age the ""right"" way to view religion and morality.  I believe Mr.   Limbaugh is against this, as his satirical use of the ""young heads full  of mush"" hyperbole indicates.        >On the News Meida  >        Hitler: ""The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of   >gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass   >by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the   >people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of   >slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews."" (Page 331.)    Pretty strong conspiracy theory insinuated here, with an implicit plea for  government power to be used to break up the conspiracy.        >        Limbaugh: ""Elements of The Media have jumped on the   >bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been   >replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During   >the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global   >network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't   >realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that   >therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided   >and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania."" (pages 270 and 268.)    Indication here that ""Elements of the Media"" (since career is a self-selected  categorization, perhaps an inferred 'larger percentage than represented in  the populace at large') has a leftist bias.  Doesn't sound too unreasonable.  No insinuation that CNN should not report in an objective fashion, only  that for reporters to say that they do not have any personal bias in the  situation is disingenuous to megalomaniacal.    You may disagree, and it may well be exagerrated, but it is not an unreasonable   opinion; and Mr. Limbaugh goes well out of his way to make sure that his   audience knows that these are his opinions, unlike most other reporting that   purports to achieve perfect objectivity but in actuality will in some degree   or other, in a statistical sense, reflect the biases of the reporters.  Who   is being disingenuous here, Mr. Shaw or Mr. Limbaugh?    Again, you should ask Mr. Limbaugh himself, but I expect that he would  oppose government control of the media.        >*     *     *            >To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but   >ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.    It is indeed depressing to see such myopia and tiresome Liberal arrogance.  Liberals love to play games with paradigms as a way of discrediting people  who disagree with them.  Why don't you challenge conservative ideology  on an intellectual level rather than engaging in ludicrous comparisons?  Perhaps the underpinnings of your ideology are intellectual only in that  they exist in your mind, not the real world.        >        After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that   >haunts me.

Perhaps there are a few among the intellectually challenged who percieve  Rush Limbaugh as a hate-monger, but in my experience he has been spreading  laughter at the ludicrous self-importance of the Left, not hatred.    As to Mr. Bush, you may be correct about his fascist economic leanings.  Mr. Reagan, on the other hand, did his best to reverse the fascist trend  of government involvement in business.  Mr. Clinton is increasing fascism  in America through ""business/government partnership"" and increased levels  of taxation.  Perhaps you should not have skipped your vocabulary classes  in grade school.        >        And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the   >radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only   >wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.    Hmmm.  Seems to me that Limbaugh is not in any way comparable to Hitler  because he has not murdered six million Jews and many, many others out of  racism.  I come from a mixed-race family, so I am quite well attuned to  racism; I don't hear any coming from Rush Limbaugh.  The only place I hear   racism coming from these days and being taken seriously is from the Liberal   Left.    The Liberal Left is the movement I see trying to get America hooked  on the opiates of Socialized Medicine, Socialized Transportation, Socialized  Education, etc.  The Left already has America hopelessly addicted to   that Liberal drug, the Social Security Chain Letter.  It is quite clear  to me that while the Hitler analogy does not really apply to either Rush   Limbaugh or William Jefferson Clinton, if one of the two is closer than   the other it is clearly the Fascist Clinton.      >The Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-  >0845; (608) 255-4460.  >  >--- 30 ---    This is the same address as ""Idiots Anonymous"", isn't it?

0,"  I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed  an interesting omission from the discussion.    You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed   concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software.    The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips  and reverse engineer it? I mean, take the thing to a chip testing/  analysis facility, one with a decent electron microscope. Just pry  off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron  microcope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I use  to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips  that we accidently blew out while running tests. They could actually find  the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was.     I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities  and that the potential is there, especially at a university where the  security at such a facility is looser, for someone to take a clipper  apart and analyze it?    What can the government do to prevent this? Start taking away all   microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes??    mark     "

What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address   data.  When the user registers, you don't even need to send executable code,   just compute his/her key and send him/her instructions to enter in the   appropriate place the following:    Name=Joe Doe  Address=123 Main Street  City=Anytown, CA  key=ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd    Every user needs a unique key.  The executable can propagate as much as you   like, the author can respond to the registration by e-mail, post card,   whatever.  Unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else's name   showing up (maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message).    Authorized users can make as many copies as they like, upgrade their   machines, whatever.  The main motivation here is guilt and irritation at   seeing someone other than yourself as the ""registered owner"". "

It's not fully  up to date with all the new variations (some of which are just different  manufacturer's synonyms):    ------  In practical terms, ignoring the technological details, this is my view  of the families (NB I am not a giant corporation, which influences my  views on things like availability and backward compatibility):    74	The original.  Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively  	obsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball  	functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.    74H	Modification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher  	power consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.    74L	Modification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.  	Very obsolete; use CMOS.    74S	Later modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in  	power consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.    74LS	Combination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower  	power consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of  	devices.    74F	Fast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high  	speed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.    74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things  	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.    74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly  	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.    74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with  	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer  	CMOS 74 families.    4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS  	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low  	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.  	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,  	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).  	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The  	clear choice when speed is not important.    74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power  	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for  	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.  	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of  	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power  	consumption at faster speeds.    74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read  	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility  	in CMOS involves some compromises.    10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources  	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for  	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow  	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,  	can be expensive.    100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and  	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.    As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and  74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices  you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just  have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible  with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of  hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.  10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.    Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are  interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet.  --   All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                      - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry "

The system may  not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but  it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some  suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys  from escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's  coercing or colluding use of some other person's Clipper phone.    I will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.  The original title perhaps should have been ""Distinction between legal  and illegal cipher systems considered harmful"", but ""Clipper considered  harmful"" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.    Assumptions:      1.  Clipper is made available.      2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal        (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws        also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio        spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper        wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such        detection a cause for further action.      3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be        associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum        some association between the common carrier's unique phone ID (ESN) and        the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.        An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a        red flag.      4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper        will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof        and much less spoofable than today's cellphones.      5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not        entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper        cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that        they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably        legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the        wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because        each one has a unique unit key.      6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they        are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because        they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be        detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly        on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise        a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under        immediate suspicion.      7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,        and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.    By #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper  phone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one's  association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips  around, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is  associated with someone else.    A non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure  communications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,  or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from  reporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted  communications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,  but the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying  or abandoning the phone before T elapses.    It would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper  phone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone  else's bill, and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion.    This leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion  and collusion.    Coercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes  a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from  a car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen  from someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to  arise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor  criminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone  who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected  communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.  The limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means  that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of  freshly coerced phones.    There would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively  wealthy criminals, and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money,  and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper  phone service for someone else's use.    Criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a  Clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal  cellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to  their stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone's use being coerced must  first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and  have its keys obtained from escrow.    Clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to  conceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance  mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,  can validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal  in realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,  which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate  pieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.    Whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium  would stand out, a criminal's use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper  medium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk  recordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper  chip is fractured.    If you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge  the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be  using someone else's phone), but you'll have no evidence to help you against  whatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be  able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you  identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.    The gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than  they were before Clipper came along.    I therefore consider Clipper harmful because:      1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against        aggressive or dishonest government.      2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct        criminal threat to the honest public.      3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to        hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than        ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring        and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.      4.  If other ciphers are proscribed, lazy investigators and prosecutors        are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime        than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key        escrow is claimed to help against.      5.  If other ciphers are proscribed, the stage is set for witch hunting        of ""illegal"" cipher use.  Because any computer can be used as a cipher        machine...

As the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air, cult leader  David Koresh sprang into action. He left his third-floor bedroom and began  looking around the house, making sure women and children were secure and   checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. Within hours, the      compound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.     This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them  who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the   six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world      since Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's   phone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the  cults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.      They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel  compound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD  meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the  women did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all  under 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what      was happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building  it shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.  Hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling  the air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than  the tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,  driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks  made. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to  gather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle  headed for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to   find Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.    Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The  FBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult  members, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions  at odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of   propane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,  it tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and  other flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked   together with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's  escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. Others  died groping in the blackness.    Frank       "

The most recent  research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State  University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns  are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by  criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in  this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when  you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because  of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding  private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study  of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%  of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime  because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,  and  57% agreed that ""most criminals are more worried  about  meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the  police.""2       One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the  women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation  that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in  response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This  should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando  Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female  populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just  the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and  obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for  that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to  experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,  a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes  showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion  rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,  the completion rate drops to 3%.     1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine  de Gruyter, NY, 1991  2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A  Survey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,  1986  -------    __________________________________________________________________________  [unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

INTRODUCTION         From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for  untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of  light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these  objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman  deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;  Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and  beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The  stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors  or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.         Science flourished during the European Renaissance.  Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were  discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were  calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device  called the telescope at the heavens and made startling  discoveries.         But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of  solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World  War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity  and travel to the Moon and to other planets.         The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then  human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated  machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the  Sun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys  while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.         These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and  understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight  and other ""senses"" of our automated spacecraft, color and  complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared  to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.  And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.         Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights  through the solar system as some of the most remarkable  achievements of the 20th century.           AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT         The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)  automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many  shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and  specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.         Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments  selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems  for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well  as for processing data and communicating with Earth.         Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft  instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays  of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its  solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for  backup and supplemental power.         Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed  millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a  planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments  pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help  prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to  control spacecraft.         The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a  constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers  used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to  maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto  fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a  spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body  and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The  thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed  of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at  the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.         Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to  study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the  inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These  three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets  because they share a solid-rock composition.         For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA  employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the  Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later  missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted  the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.         All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power  source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had  two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were  equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal  bodies.         Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus  spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the  Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147  pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the  program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had  originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The  Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components  left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.         In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.  Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,  Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite  different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.         Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers  -- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar  system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took  anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.  Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first  human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's  light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers  do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity  generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.         NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit  our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin  Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather  stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --  descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers  from Earth and then studied martian features from above.         Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.  The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument  that allowed it to ""see"" through the planet's dense cloud cover  to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried  four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and  the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --  radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their  descent toward the surface.         A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including  Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet  Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being  developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed  examinations that will increase our understanding of our  neighborhood and our own planet.           The Sun         A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start  with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing  approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;  all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up  to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the  material left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine  Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its  interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.         As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of  fusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees  Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there  is 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's  surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees  Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.  At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing  energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams  of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.         The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years  and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or  so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium  into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing  so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a  ""red giant,"" it will suddenly collapse into a ""white dwarf"" --  the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion  years to cool off completely.         Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but  none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately  two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,  the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft  have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,  launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and  the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to  change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar  regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of  studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.         We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If  it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly  never have developed on Earth.           Mercury         Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the  primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on  November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a  journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,  the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the  solar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.         Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the  best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct  object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the  Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is  visible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it  is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar  telescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to  the voyage of Mariner 10.         The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an  ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own  Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the  planet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior  cooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as  high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310  miles).         Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak  magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the  density of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon  and helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,  surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees  Fahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius  (-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface  temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --  is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury  literally bakes and freezes at the same time.         Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a  slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid  revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury  solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time  it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the  Sun!          Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like  that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich  core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would  make Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core  or those of any of the planets.         After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two  additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --  before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted  and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same  local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was  illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the  planet's surface.           Venus         Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary  neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2  spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more  than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the  mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,  plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,  romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to  rest.         On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839  kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first  spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured  Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much  closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544  miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's  instruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,  radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner  10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth  showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.         In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were  launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4  of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first  spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.         Five days later, the five separate components making up the  second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the  Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The  four small, independent probes and the main body radioed  atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the  surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the  probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to  transmit data for another hour.         Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and  density more closely than any other known planet. However,  spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For  example, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)  compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other  planets.         Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as  dense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of  Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a  greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but  trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into  space. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is  482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt  lead.         A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the  first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and  determining surface features over almost the entire planet.  NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in  orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses  radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images  of the surface.         Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic  features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface  show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows  lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar  Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At  one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size  of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a  100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep  impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are  named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are  the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million  years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.         Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the  result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics  on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to  weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing  the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like  the San Andreas Fault in California.         Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,  high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At  speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,  the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The  circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'  slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in  both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six  alternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified  laboratory for the study of our weather.           Earth         As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing  characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses  and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting  of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other  constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor  life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million  kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the  Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter  just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.         Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give  rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the  atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation  coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects  us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can  strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no  evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon  after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the  other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in  the early days of the solar system.         From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our  home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was  launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and  discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen  radiation belts, surrounding Earth.         Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our  planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by  the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously  ejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does  not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now  know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and  uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and  contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the  upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.         Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise  to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged  particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic  field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's  magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are  known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.         Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in  space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These  watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous  global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and  contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather  systems.         From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey  Earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's  health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided  tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our  planet in dangerous ways.           The Moon         The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first  human footsteps on an alien world were made by American  astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless  companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo  expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and  Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.         NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials  and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the  lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection  of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)  and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.         From this material and other studies, scientists have  constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.  Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3  billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's  existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.  As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into  different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids  and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode  Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created  basins hundreds of kilometers across.         This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four  billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,  overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken  rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to  melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers  (125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million  years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose  from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the  surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas  that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,  called maria, meaning seas.         As far as we can tell, there has been no significant  volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.  Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by  micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,  by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and  astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion  years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the  one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the  Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.         The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories  attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate  body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was  captured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a  collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.  The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.           Mars         Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar  system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.  Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what  appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These  observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led  to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a  system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson  Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction  classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed  in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.         Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to  do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's  surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might  support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months  and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.         So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.  Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one  placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively  before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.         Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,  1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the  surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the  planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring  channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.  Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of  1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a  diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry  atmosphere of carbon dioxide.         On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a  mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The  spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to  find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made  surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the  storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329  pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,  including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across  the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.         In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft  -- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from  Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several  questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?  Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was  hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at  least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.         Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully  touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,  while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos  sent back from the Chryse Planitia (""Plains of Gold"") showed a  bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the  lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked  by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives  the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia  Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape  than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible  dunes.         The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking  Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil  were tested in three different experiments designed to detect  biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to  indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this  activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil  chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the  Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist  there.         The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind  velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and  pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest  temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7  degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.         The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees  Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2  site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at  the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but  because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking  Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably  water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.         The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily  carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small  percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much  water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,  forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around  the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning  fog can form in valleys.         There is evidence that in the past a denser martian  atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical  features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and  islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.         Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and  irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is  possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too  close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.         The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins  their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The  first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on  July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.  Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut  down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on  August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was  used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.         Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology  experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except  Earth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in  September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian  environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet.            Asteroids         The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic  objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be  considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as  asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a  band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have  orbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth  has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,  best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near  Winslow, Arizona.         Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the  solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a  planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More  likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a  planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was  gathered into a single object, the object would be only about  1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the  diameter of our Moon.          Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It  is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be  photographed through Earth-based telescopes.         Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from  examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of  Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are  called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at  high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to  incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the  meteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes  Earth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places  to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.         Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of  silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and  nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony  meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much  like terrestrial rocks.         Since asteroids are material from the very early solar  system, scientists are interested in their composition.  Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found  that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are  separated by very large distances.         Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids  for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in  October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to  Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini  missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for  launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini  missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space  Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as  well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.  One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw  materials.           Jupiter         Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of  our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,  Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four  spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these  colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter  was the first port of call.         Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in  March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid  belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In  December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,  flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's  banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1  and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned  spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites  during flybys in 1979.         These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of  liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere  composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice  crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps  phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that  characterize Jupiter's atmosphere.         It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases  react to form organic molecules in the regions between the  planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying  below. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these  organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.         The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through  telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's  atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a  high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction  opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is  surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and  are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a  million years old.         Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper  atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's  northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned  the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.         Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a  dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The  massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey  around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a  miniature solar system.         A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under  way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once  past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two  asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into  Jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo  Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close  to Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two  Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.           Galilean Satellites         In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and  spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first  time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of  their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the  Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily  traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs  returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these  planet-sized satellites.         One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission  was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.  Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world  other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine  active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending  as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.         Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow  hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to  the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this  satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the  gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three  Galilean moons.         Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the  brightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a  complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been  fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa  has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --  apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered  by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the  cold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its  center.         Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and  Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest  satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury  and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or  ice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different  brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of  the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the  surface.         Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the  lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large  amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the  most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity  during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.         Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be  performed by the Galileo Orbiter.           Saturn         No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its  exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is  composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors  and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere  has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted  by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking  appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity  equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100  miles) per hour.         Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11  sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,  returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in  November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that  revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring  system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in  August 1981.         The rings are composed of countless low-density particles  orbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive  distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves  passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely  in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are  bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.         The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body  ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been  torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its  interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin  with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A  third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions  with larger objects orbiting the planet.         Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each  other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by  the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These  complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets  that make up the major rings.         Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM  car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager  spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are  believed to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its  atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at  Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near  Saturn's poles.         The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several  satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons  shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps  in the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from  images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.          Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based  atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in  composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and  Venus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290  degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands  rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.  Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's  dense clouds.         Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be  converting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in  combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter  compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may  be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth  between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's  atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit  progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.         The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini  mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will  also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into  Titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the  probe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will  spend years examining the Saturnian system.           Uranus         In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting  Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the  Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about  Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from  ground observations since the planet's discovery over two  centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.         Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the  solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of  Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and  south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing  around the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole  faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an  Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the  solar system.         Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow  the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,  the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's  center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one  magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of  Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.         Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12  percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water  vapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its  atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580  kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud  tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).         Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of  photochemical ""smog"" believed to be a combination of acetylene,  ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the  planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into  space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as ""electroglow.""         Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'  cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and  dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.  Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.         Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105  miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --  Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from  520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing  a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock  spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past  activity, including faulting and ice flows.         The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface  features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and  winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,  after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with  another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which  contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments  from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda  apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in  its interior exposed on its surface.         Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged  11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright  particles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,  boulder-sized chunks.           Neptune         Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system  with an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On  August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers  (3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.  During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's  atmosphere was more active than Uranus'.          Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the  size of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's  Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves  westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager  2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed  the ""Scooter,"" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main  hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any  planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per  hour.         Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen  and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core  contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the  other gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like  Uranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.         Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's  spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is  similar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of  the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,  where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the  electrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the  other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only  slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.         Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.  Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of  material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how  Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from  spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected  these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.  A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies  were not spotted.         Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in  1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new  moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since  Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's  glare for observers on Earth.          Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six  days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly  towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in  astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian  gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to  accompany the planet's modest current rings.         Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of  Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at  Saturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of  water-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and  methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of  terrain: the so-called ""cantaloupe"" terrain and a receding ice  cap.          Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the  fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas  and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers  (1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as  thick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and  deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet  found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees  Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other  object spacecraft have so far visited.           Pluto         Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the  eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside  Neptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will  remain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --  tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.         Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a  celestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be  approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the  size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's  surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin  atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet  moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin  axis is tipped by 122 degrees.          The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in  1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the  moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane  ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both  bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's  and Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution  are all 6.4 Earth days.          Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is  currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.           Comets         The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a  visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and  metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets  are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only  far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a  loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching  perhaps halfway to the nearest star.         Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are  gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close  to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer  planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually  warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner  planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself  is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally  of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar  to those composing the moons of the giant planets.         As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma  or cloud-like ""head"" that can measure tens of thousands of  kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the  Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes  on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving  rise to the comet's ""tails."" Gases and ions are blown directly  back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.  As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are  left behind in a curved arc.         Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in  effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.  The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in  length, but the total amount of material contained in this  dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --  from the Latin cometa, meaning ""long-haired"" -- are essentially  dramatic light shows.         Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but  others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close  encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter  visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return  to the inner solar system.         Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively  short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76  years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.  Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular  visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,  because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,  based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name  became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet  returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to  see it.         A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes  comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent  appearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million  kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was  visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern  hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so  bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.  Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens  and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.         The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will  become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and  remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF  will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing  sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and  form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at  high speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer  in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet  and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by  Halley's Comet in 1986.           Conclusion         Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of  space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had  only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,  spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our  neighbors in space.          We have learned more about our solar system and its members  than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated  spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets  beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large  as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar  environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of  bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for  generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange  and beautiful places and objects.         The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar  system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and  meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called  comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,  moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and  similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history  of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.         We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather  systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by  investigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the  solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and  processes on Earth.         We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated  spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission  is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach  the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future  missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid  belt.         We can also look forward to the time when humans will once  again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not  been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being  formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the  human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian  outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a  lunar base or a martian colony!    - end -        "

I'm a great admirer of the Swiss, but  500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership. Can you  picture Hitler, with Panzers and Focke-Wulfs poised on the border, losing  sleep over a few thousand expert rifleman? Sure.   Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this  world. We'd do well to emulate them on that and forget about getting more  rifles on the street.

2,"    We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on    Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent    Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to    encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our    three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release    that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.      On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family    will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public    awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.    Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease    characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and    trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would    lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.     Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis    last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her    lifetime.      Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives    of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory    Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide    support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a    newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid    in the prevention, cure, and treatment.    Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to    those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money    were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant    attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP    Foundation's mission is to change that.     Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call    Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the    Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown    Princeton, or sent directly to:    			The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation  	                50 Wesleyan Drive  	                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.

The problem is that I  generally expect better from the FBI than from the BATF.  Unfortunately,  the FBI seems so desparate to deflect ANY criticism of themselves that  they are grasping at ANY straw, no matter how thin.    I saw in the ""Cleveland Plain Dealer"" this morning a report that the CEV  crew threw CS *CANNISTERS* into the Davidian house.  I KNOW from  personal experience that burning type devices start fires.  I certainly  put out enough of them in the pine forests of Ft. Benning in the summer  of '80.  I'd like to know if they really threw burning CS grenades.  --   *************************************************************************  If you were smarter, you'd have these opinions....  ******************************************************************************* "

0,"  Here is a disturbing thought.    Now, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in  the electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database  get? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were  I an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow  houses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)    Well, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of  serial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but  this is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the  population, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for  each of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very  valuable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who  cares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my  pocket on two 8mm tapes.    Admittely, they will think of safeguards. They won't put the whole  database on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks  in the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day  by hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience  will dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At  some point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte  tapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will  doubtless claim this can't happen -- but we know that ""can't"" is a  prayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.    With two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for  every person's conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you  need the ""master key"" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information  that have to be stored an awful lot of places.    Come to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database  isn't a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial  political views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the  ones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the  evil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have  a big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial  secrets, so he isn't being completely irrational here (although why  our companies couldn't use cryptosystems without back doors is left  unexplained by those that point out this threat.)     Presumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA  and other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened  many times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some  fraction of the keys. You can't avoid that sort of thing.    Don't pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on  the escrow databases.    We crypto types are all taught something very important at the  beginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the  easily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a  secret. The escrow databases aren't the sorts of secrets that our  teachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they  would lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million  Clipper chips.    I cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this  doesn't realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too  many of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect  that they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are  doing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue  to surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect  that they realize that they can't put things off forever, but they can  try to delay things as long as possible.    Who knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable  bureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe  that this scheme might give people some security, even as their  subordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of  it all.    --  Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com  --  Laissez faire, laissez passer.

2,"    Some time ago I sent the following message:     Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony.  I'm gearing up to     do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move     onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have     to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,       How many people do you want to share the colony with?          What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?           Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave     from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young     enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.

Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the  percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there  were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.  And everyone, especially me, likes to ""go exploring""...I would want to be able  to go for a walk and see something different each time...    =============================================================================    For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enough  to have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town  ""everybody knows everything"" syndrome, which some people like but  I don't.  Call it several thousand people.    For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough  to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time  getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough  for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that  5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

0,"  Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors  and provides some additional information and explanation.                           THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY                                   Dorothy Denning                               Revised, April 21, 1993      INTRODUCTION    On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring  together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program  to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of  law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption  chip called the ""Clipper Chip"" together with a split-key approach to  escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from  both are needed to reconstruct a key.      CHIP CONTENTS    The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block  encryption algorithm called ""Skipjack.""  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys  (compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling  (compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of  operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic  Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.    Each chip includes the following components:       the Skipjack encryption algorithm     F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips     N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)     U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip    The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the  ""MYK-78.""  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are  implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about  $30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the  technology is shrunk to .8 micron.      ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP    To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T  telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and  we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure  conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K  with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place  without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can  be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.    Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to  encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The  telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two  values:       E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field ,     which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement  field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U  concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family  key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after  an authorized wiretap has been installed.    The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver's device using the  session key:       D[E[M; K]; K] = M .      CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW    All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented  Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains  a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips  are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at  Mykotronx.    At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key  escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random  80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random  80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit  keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a  function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.      To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is  first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.  S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a  64-bit block R1:            R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .    Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and  N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:              R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]           R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .    R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The  first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The  rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2  are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow  agencies.    As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are  written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a  file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part  U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third  disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent  2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing  an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not  know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit  key parts.      The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are  programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents  leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no  information is left behind.     The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the  room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,  and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to  the escrow agencies.     The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not  be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or  both may be independent from the government.      LAW ENFORCEMENT USE    When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they  will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get  access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in  place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the  Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the  family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap  has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is  then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who  return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed  together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the  session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will  be accomplished through a special black box decoder.      CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION    A successor to the Clipper Chip, called ""Capstone"" by the government  and ""MYK-80"" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include  the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the  Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast  exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for  testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for  delivery in June or July.      ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND DISTRIBUTION NOTICE.

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency  analyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which  means that every frequency is present in the noise signal.    Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass  filtering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much more  low-frequency components.    The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring  animals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will  explain you why.    Enjoy it.    Wouter. "

The cable tv companies    even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable    tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency    conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running    into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look    for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or    the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far    bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an    administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they    get...  The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their    rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get    out of our freqencies.

The technology of cellular phones will  probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext  without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I  understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.    Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The  telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule  today.    But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the  judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext  without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain  cellular calls and then ask a judge, ""Hey, can we have permission to  listen to those tapes?"" can they?    >worse, of course, if the government then uses this ""Clinton Clipper""  >to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main  >concern of most of us, I think. The camel's nose in the tent, etc.)    Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can  win just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even  have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the  really smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti, who would have to be retarded  not to realize he was likely to be wiretapped, glibly chatted away  on his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now.  Hard to believe, but true.      This scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people would  fight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so  called ""Digital Telephony"" proposal, according to rumours.  However the  meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext  on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.  --   Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366 "

1,"    Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.  After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided  that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant  posting.    *** file follows ***     Hi Folks;    As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it  kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the  Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.    Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other  legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things  start today.    More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen  Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the  courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, ""Who stands  trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)  Weaver?""  On the evening news she said, ""I am here protesting  because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.  I thought we all did.""  Nice sound bite (grin)!    The news reporter also interviewed some guy named ""Tim""  who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the  guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he  expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.  ""Tim"" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver  and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop  telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know  the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law  against political activity within X feet of a courthouse  or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).    Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed  an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam  FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.    Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to  leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case  any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence  came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.    More stuff as it comes available.    Drew "

Alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  You are now making the exact point  that I've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  You don't not  have to believe in the ""religious"" aspects of Judaism to be a Jew (this would confine  Judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a Christianity.).  So, by converting out of  Judaism, I don't mean just not believing in the god of Judaism.  I mean voluntarily  removing yourself from the Jewish nation.  I am an agnostic but still consider myself  Jewish because of my cultural heritage.  (I admit that many religious jews would argue  that I am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but Judaism is a religion of  dissent and debate isn't it?).  The fact that one can opt to become Jewish simply by  converting to Judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most  open nation.  We have no quotas!    So I will once again make my point.  Defining a member of the Jewish nation by religion  (not, as you say, religious belief) is NOT racism.  You come to your incorrect conclusion  because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and  when you define judaism.    -Adam Schwartz   "

2,"  The following article by columnist Mike Royko is his humorous commentary  on some of the public's perception of doctors and their salaries.  I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did.    ____________________________________________________________________________  [Reprinted w/o permission]      ""There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries""    By Mike Royko  Tribune Media Services           On a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings   is right up there.  It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.       It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called   Families USA.        The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe   that doctors make too much money.       The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for   physicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be   OK.       How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.       Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment   and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign   and are still simmering.       You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that   earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority   of Americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who   do are stealing it from them.       Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.    Karl Marx lives.       It's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such   as:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to   become a physician?       If those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should   have  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they   should have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much   a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a   doctor?       Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  ""How   much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent   grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order   to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking   courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and   maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years   of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth   years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and   (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e)   put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training,   depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in   debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60   hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or   more until they retire or fall over?""       As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably   more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and   Clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have   called together to remake America's health care.       Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far   more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing,   social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is   to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality.       But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates,   many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the   major cause of high medical costs.       Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.    Americans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for   our longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in   a McDonald's?       And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become   a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch   cabbages.       Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or   Super  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But   instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain,   they might have been more honest if they had said:       ""Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest   problems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes,   you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you   guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack;   getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the   microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into   the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot   victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease   while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.       ""You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single   biggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is   amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.       ""In fact,  I don't understand how they can stand looking  at   your blubbery bods all day.       ""So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and   start living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-  greasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.""       But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid,   there is another solution: Don't use them.       That's right.   You don't feel well?   Then try one of those   spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands   upon your head and declare you fit.       Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest   pains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit   there, and pop in a couple of valves.       You're  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that   overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house   than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and   malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?       Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.    And if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on   how to give it its shots.       By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much   pollsters should earn?

Igor and I had thought that if it was   a girl we would call her Raisa, after my mother-in-law, and if it was a boy,   we'd call him Arsen, after Igor's grandfather. I had a girl, and I, without  Igor, named her Raisa, in honor of her dead grandmother.    Our family and the Melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. Igor and I grew   up together, we were friends from childhood on. We got engaged when I was 16.   In 1981, when I was 18, we were married. Two children were born to us in   Sumgait. My daughter is now 6 years old, her name is Kristina, and my son,  Seryozha, is four and a half.    First I shall tell what happened on February 27. That day on my way home from   work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered. There were   Komsomol members there, and Pioneers [Children's organization], and there were   both Party members and non-Party people there as well. All of them were   shouting, ""There's no room for Christians here!"" and ""When we finish with the   Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!"" And some even cried Out, ""Death to   the Armenians!"" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became   frightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen   downtown. My family couldn't believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich   Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o'clock he   returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was   smashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I   was telling him everything, too, and he said, ""What, is there no longer any  government?"" That same day Igor said, ""Papa, something terrible is happening   in the city."" And he said, ""We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our   own home.""    The day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out. We called   our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the   same thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an   Armenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I   called the police: they're wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and   nonetheless they didn't come and they didn't do anything.    On February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were   afraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I   told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't   be coming in. He agreed, and even said, ""Fine, don't come in, we understand   what's going on in town, don't come in.""    Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my   father-in-law and said, ""Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are   happening in town."" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, ""With my own eyes I   saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don't know,"" he said, ""we   should leave town."" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we   should go, thinking we'd go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together,   clothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the   building manager came by and said, ""Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is   bad, don't go out."" My father even opened up to him and said, ""Maybe we'll   drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there."" ""No,"" he said, ""it'll be worse   there, you'll be safer at home."" He said don't be afraid, if something happens   I'll send people to save you.    After he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our   courtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two   children, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my   mother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of   them, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started  breaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, ""Go in that room  and close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won't hear  that there's anyone home."" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my   brother-in-law's wife, suggested, ""Let's run out onto the balcony."" We -- the  two daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out  onto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said,   ""Quick, over to the other balcony, or they'll kill you all."" We lived on the  second floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's. At  first we couldn't manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time  people were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I   pleaded and begged: ""Please, call someone, have someone come!"" I even started   shouting. ""I'll throw down the children, I'll throw them down, you catch them   and take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive."" Either they   were afraid or . . . I don't know what. They looked as though they were   watching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I'll say it   again, these weren't the bandits, these were people from the other part of the   building and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A   bus even stopped. I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbing  over to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children   over there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn't yet   seven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first;   you know, I just don't remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think,   and Edik's wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and   crying. My Kristina said, ""Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're   afraid!"" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina   didn't even want to climb over. She shouted, ""I'm staying with Grandmother,  I'm staying with Grandma!"" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And   my mother-in-law shouted, ""Oh no, Kristina's still there, she's still there,   save Kristina, too!"" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira   helped us and went back inside.    We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door. I pounded with my fist,   Sevil, open the door, open it, please!"" She didn't open it. ""No, go away, go   anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door."" She was our neighbor, we were   friends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we   were going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and   said, ""Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don't stay here, they'll   kill us, too, because of you."" I begged, ""Please, at least take the children,   we'll leave, we'll go back."" ""No,"" she said, ""you have to leave."" Her sons ran   in, one had a knife. Sevil's brother, he's around 18, shouted at us: ""Get out   of here, leave, I'll kill you with this knife!"" I became terrified, I took the   children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down   and heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard ""The Armenians must be   killed, they've taken all the best places, all the best apartments!"" One of   them said, ""Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!"" When I   heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their   door for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn't see Zhasmen any   longer. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay,   that they would save her.    My head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next   entryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a   half. They were crying, ""Mamma, we're scared!"" They were so frightened that I   didn't even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was   awful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, ""Open up, let   me inside!"" He opened the door slightly and said, ""No!"" ""No"" and that was it!   He said it so sternly: ""No!"" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists   on the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood   there, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get   down on my knees. ""Please, I beg of you, at least take the children."" He   wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don't even know how, but he let me   inside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn't   passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn't want   to open the door. And again I started pleading, ""Please, open the door, it's   our Ira and Lilia! Open the door!"" And he said, ""No, I'm afraid."" I said again   and again, ""Please, open the door, please!"" He looked at me. He looked at me   for a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We   threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying. Then the man locked us into   the bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, ""Calm   the children, and calm yourselves down, too.""    Calm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in   our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I   said, ""Igor, Edik, let's say farewell."" And Edik turned around and looked at   me as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would   kill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They   started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that   he had told us, ""Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight."" He thought we   were in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them:   ""Edik, Igor, let's say farewell."" Igor didn't think we could climb over to the   other balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can't believe we were   able to save ourselves.    Igor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All   the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next   to the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from   the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: ""Open the door!"" We   were all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, ""They're home,  they're in there, break down the door!"" And I remember my father-in-law   whispering, ""They're going to break it down now, it's coming down now . . . ""    He had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were   going to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal   chair legs. From outside the door they said, ""We're counting to five, open   up!"" But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them. We made like no one was   home. We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave. My father-in-law   had said, ""It's not possible they'd come into my home. How can that be?   Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with   everyone."" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani   guest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there   often, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save   ourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, ""I'm not   leaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I'm going to fight   alongside them."" That's just what she said. She picked up a knife and said,   ""If they open the door and come into the apartment then I'm going to fight   alongside my family, I'm not going anywhere.""    We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and   shouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor   at the Lezgin's apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira's   voice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a   long time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: ""Open the   door, what are they doing to Ira, who's shouting, that's Ira shouting, that's   her voice!"" But the Lezgin said, ""It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in   your apartment."" He was lying to me so I'd calm down. Two hours went by and   the Lezgin opened the door and said, ""Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran   away."" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him   outside, next to the building.    While we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The   way Ira shouted! She shouted, ""Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!""   She repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many   people there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling,   whistling--you just can't imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.    Apparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway   where we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I   don't know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in  particular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed   over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law   were climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming   up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were   our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them.   They were sleeping. I woke them up: ""Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!"" And I tell   Ira: ""Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony."" We   were on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door   too, because later he said, ""I opened the door and told them there were no   Armenians inside."" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the   balcony himself to see: they were gone.    We weren't friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from   the building. But the people we were friends with wouldn't even consider   hiding us.    The Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said,   ""Karina, there're no lights on in our block."" The whole block was dark, the   whole block! It's a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, ""I'm afraid to keep  you until morning, I'm afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving  you."" I said, ""What are you saying, we'll leave now. But we can't just leave  with the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere  else to hide."" He said, ""Well OK, go look."" I asked Ira, ""Ira, do you want to  go?"" Ira said, ""No, I'll stay with the children, Karina."" I said, ""Fine, then  I'll go."" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one   was in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at   after seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never   went out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a  slaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the   boarding school and my director answered. He said, ""Karina, where are you?"" I  didn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I   was. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what   time it was, I asked him, ""What time is it?"" He said 11:20, I think, but I   don't really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I   look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there  was the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse   for a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen   grabbed my hand and squeezed it: ""Hurry up, let's go . . . Hurry up, come on,   what are you turning around for?"" I turned around and saw a large truck, it   must have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck   like that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the   fourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police   then they'll put me away. I couldn't count on them. Before I reached the   police station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, ""Soldier, in   Block 41, I don't know if they've killed people or injured them--we need to   save them!"" And he said, ""Go to the police station and tell them everything.""   I said, ""I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them."" He said, ""Don't be   afraid.""    We went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military   vehicle went to our building. I didn't go with them, they left me at the   police station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that   they'd rescue them, too. I didn't know where they were or what had happened to  them.    After a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us   to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they   took us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there,   very many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was   only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots,   nothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.    The Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably   alive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of   Sumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came   and told us, ""Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party   Committee."" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for   six days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee   and waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira   had only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went   by. And then one of the functionaries told us, ""Karina, Ira, gather your   courage. Would you like to go to the burial?"" I said, ""What, did they really   kill all of them?!"" He said, ""Let's look."" He had a long list, and he started   reading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-  law, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,  and Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said,   ""Get in the car, let's go to the burial.""    We buried our family. I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceive  of it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my   children when they're older?    My children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and  grandmother. Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather and  grandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, ""My grandma is   better than anyone!"" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it's   difficult for her, and once she told her: ""You're a bad grandmother.""    I don't know why, I asked her, ""Kristina, where's Papa?"" and she said, ""They   killed him."" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded  Seryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, ""When Papa   comes I'm going to tell him everything!""

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived   on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet   and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The   Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its   Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the   remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years,   Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds.     The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.    Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and   Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.    Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its   predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against   humanity.    x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims   by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.    >You have now done so four times in a row.

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941,   while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration   camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian   battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had   grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the  former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the  short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the   cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.  An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party   leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by   this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed   and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the   members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of   extermination of the Jews.    This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""  performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and  exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.    Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted  a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros  Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided  to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province  of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia  claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia  (around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it  had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set  about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who  could be expected to oppose their plans.     On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian  and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British  planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even   though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over  60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the   British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of  the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier  in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction  of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of  Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded  by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left   the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few   Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British  soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the  disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.     Rawlinson wired to his superiors,     ""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in   independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops    being without discipline and not being under effective control,   atrocities were constantly being committed.""     >Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:    Come again?    : ""These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...  >(34 lines deleted)    Why?    : No wonder you are in such a mess.

2,"    I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations  rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is  utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to  BATSE press releases.  The idea behind the statement is as follows:        ""if you smack two neutron        stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,        a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a        cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy         is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes        thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.        The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must        be wrong.""  As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who  was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It  may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray  burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created  may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding   medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may  carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All  this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,  Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.  It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one  around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative  proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the   so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which  a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black  hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter  will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal  force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the  black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,  which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such  events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,  but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate  of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two  scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less  in the failed supernova scenario.    On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must   ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method  such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,  or finding a definitive signature of some known class of  objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists  have historically not been too successfull in finding the  distance of any object by proving that there is only one  possible way in which the object can work, and therefore  it *must* be so-and-so.

The success of the Greek national movement,    provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the    efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the    other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so    much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which    dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious    independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the    Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent    aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>      page 188:      <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their     campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular     representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian     missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and     hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as     ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.       Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,     soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews     and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.     Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving     large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,     by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects     who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim     support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent     nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive     and damaging.       The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting     nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian     states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout     the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary     in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>      page 188:      <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,     their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and     massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking     boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which     had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries     earlier.       This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth     century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united     Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth     century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its     Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When     Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian     principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre     of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>      page 189:      <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century.

When the Greek nationalist     movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia     during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by     the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During     the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred     in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about     twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were     massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,     after describing the carnage, concluded 'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled     with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac     and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the     Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the     city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial     superior to that of an ass.' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of     Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of     Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].     The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled     from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity     under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into     rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before     it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression     and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities     to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years     of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the     mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the     Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately     fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary     accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying     exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of     the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats     to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman     Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,     particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the     Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their     populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th     century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews     who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu     and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands     more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and     Izmir [21].>>       page 193 (last paragraph):       <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing     protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe     stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all     the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being     used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as     for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and     professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian     millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,     Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the     Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally     atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their     homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors     fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements     subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done     in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the     twentieth century.>>      page 194 (last paragraph):      <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the     Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the     Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due     to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of     those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a     popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of     the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,     thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms     in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods     of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from     persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.       The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian     forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,     and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,     homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus     toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically     described the situation caused by the invading armies:          'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,        all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never        destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the        entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can        never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the        damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done        to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government        weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors        inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. The        consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the Muslims, but sixty of        them were massacred in a single night....'[28]         'It wasn't only irregulars (Comitacis) who massacred, pillaged and        burned. The soldiers of the Army, the Chief of Police, and the high        civil officials took an active part in the events at Serres. Out of        6,000 houses, 4,000 were burned. Almost 1,200 shops were consumed by        flames and destructive bombs. The (Jewish) population lost all, and        without even anything to wear is in despair.

2,"    Hello--    I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that  it proudly proclaims ""8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING"" on the box.  Now while I think  I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete ""samples""  exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),  I don't understand this ""8 TIMES"" business...  It seems to me that when  I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs  said ""4 TIMES"" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting  senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take  samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't  I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording  process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate  (from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data  rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean  that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has   changed since 1983?    I'm so confused...      --Cliff    --   | Clifford Bowman, Box 1890, Russellville, AR  72811 | hcb@netcom.com |  | I'm pretty sure the world *isn't* fair...

2,"  I am quite near sighted.    I've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal  holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. In my  left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the  laser was used to ""weld"" this back in place as well.    My right eye seems fine. In my left eye I was seeing occasional  flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. Since the  treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often  - several each hour.    The opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the  vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. He  says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own  accord - if it tugs enough I may well face retinal detachment.    I am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.  The Dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations  so I appreciate any further details anyone can provide. Of most  interest to me:    If my retina does detach what should be my immediate course  of action?    If conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is  the procedure like and what kind of vision can I expect  afterwards.    Do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment  maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis.    Previously, low residue diets were recommended, but this advice has  now changed.  Also, there will be differences in advice in patients with  and without obstructuon remaining, so input by the physician will be   important.  I find the dietician very important in my practice, and   I send most of my patients to a dietician in the course of seeing  them, since dieticians know so much better how to get diet histories  and evaluate the contents of a diet than I do.

This could be backed by  adjudication at the International Court of Justice and enforcement  through a Rapid Deployment Force under the U.N. Secretary General's  command.  I would like to see the U.N.  directly impose ICJ rulings  whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the UN Security  Council.. much as the President can't veto a U.S. Supreme Court  ruling).      The U.S. is now supporting the effort to appoint the HR Czar -- the  third world opposition is led by three countries, China, Iran and  Pakistan (What company is Pakistan keeping!).      The U.S. is also reconsidering its opposition to the U.N. force  initially envisaged in the Charter (although under the control of the  Security Council).  The UN SC is quite a flawed body.  Rogue  governments like the PRC have even threatened their veto in the last  few months to block the move to place U.N. troops in Bosnia under  Chapter 7 instead of 11 (if I have the numbers straight) where they  could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force  without requiring further SC action.  (The PRC even continues to  threaten using its veto on U.N. action despite the ICJ ruling.  The  current set-up requires the SC to enforce ICJ rulings..).    Peace,    Gul Agha "

2,"  KS> From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)  KS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome  KS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg  KS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information    I'm not sure that this condition is ""recognised"" anywhere (in the  sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries  between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic  features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.    Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease  by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities  are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of  ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of  declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.  Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless  contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows  muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old  denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit  action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation  (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation  with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active  denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme  staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.    Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically  evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,  the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one  year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio  before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among  polio survivors than among people who never had polio.    The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little  evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or  destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.    There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have  anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,  motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than  patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.  Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason  for these ""acute"" changes in a ""chronic"" disease (old polio) is  unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge  numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several  years.    There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio  syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny  deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe  polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.  They also tend to score higher on depression scales of  neuropsychologic tests.    My take on this (I'm sure some will disagree):  after recovery from  severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,  ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or  degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing  pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads  to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am  perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS  patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe  that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than  non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but  without PPS complaints).  ---   .

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri-  helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about  2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU.  If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet  ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's --  which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could  get under Jupiter's influence.    > Also, perihelions of Gehrels3 were:  >   > April  1973     83 jupiter radii  > August 1970     ~3 jupiter radii    Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.

If this guess is wrong, I apologize.    	 PGP 2 key by finger or e-mail     Eli   ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu "

2,"  As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager   I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with   the results.  The catalog description is as follows:    	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  	counter-rotating ""thumbs"" that move in one-inch orbits --  	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.    	Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109    To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or  fax at 1-800-345-4021.    ********  NOTE:  When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price  was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog  enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was    QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,  and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it  looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the  first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a  reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to  ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could   use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old   one.  VERY reasonable people.  ********    I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I   would be described as ""structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches   and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.    If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough  time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,   more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require   physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit   to get the prescription for p.t.      The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache  (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my   physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles   in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the   headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to   while it is being massaged.    I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing  someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my   neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in   the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient   p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up   in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.    I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base  unit is about a 14"" x 9"" rectangle, about 3-3/4"" high, with handles on each  side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal ""thumbs"" are about   1-1/2"" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2"" above the base.  The thumbs   are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more   toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in   either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side   of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either  side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck  or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                       _______________________________                  |  __    _______________    __  |                  | |  |  |		|  |  | |                  | |  |  |  \^^/   \^^/  |  |  | |                  | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                  | |  |  |		|  |  | |                  | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                  | |__|			   |__| |                  |_______________________________|      For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if   laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or   neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or  standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are  also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I   don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works   well for me.    For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager  behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or  not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.    If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches   whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use   than the commonly used ""home-made"" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together   (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and   move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than   nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are   not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't   pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this   is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple   considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.    Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion   for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my  neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard  against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a  few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.    After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,   the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.    I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the   most vulnerable point for me.    It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,  although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at  a time) to really work it out.    I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I  cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had  it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also   to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have  been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this   was very timely  for me.    This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently  became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been  in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,  while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog  products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought  put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones  I've seen such as ""Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog"" or ""Mature Wisdom"".  I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no  big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,   particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.    I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would   like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

Let's start with looking at the professionals, the NSA itself.  Its birth was by secret executive order by Harry S Truman  in 1952.  Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive  order chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?    On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence  with multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs  prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal  Security Act.  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit  television.  More paranoia.    These are professionals,  Maybe they know something we don't, eh?    Do you think it would have helped Admiral Yamamoto if the Japanese  had been a little more 'paranoid' of their purple cipher?    Or maybe the Germans should have been a little more 'paranoid' about  their Engima with respect to Turing and the British.    How about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram?  Would a little  more paranoia have helped the Germans here?    Maybe the NSA should have been a little more 'paranoid' about  Emma Woikin, or Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., or  ...    Maybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation  with the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic  Secrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers.. paranoia, right?    The most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was  the one-time pad, even with the necessity of keeping incriminating  evidence about, is known to be the only proven unbreakable system.  Soviet paranoia, right?    And what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers?  And   huge Rhombics pointed embassy row?  And their sites near  satellite uplink and downlink sites?  Duh.    When I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time  even with a ""secret"" clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet  and the entire site was built INTO a Mosler-type vault with *very*  thick bomb-proof door.  MITRE paranoia?    I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as  best hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as  it can, as fast as it can.  One would be a fool to ignore the  pattern of facts and conclude that they were random...    And we know the government is violent -- even against children as  recent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace  but a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence  that our government institutions have in their contempt for our  civil rights.    And of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of  caution because that does much less harm than erring on the  reckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.    I might suggest, Andrew, that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and  Bamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to  support your sheepish acquiescence to authority.     --   grady@netcom.com  2EF221 / 15 E2 AD D3 D1 C6 F3 FC  58 AC F7 3D 4F 01 1E 2F   "
0,"  From Denning:       the Skipjack encryption algorithm     F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips     N, a 30-bit serial number     U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip       E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and      E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.      Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.  Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.    Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential  analysis).    Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip  and its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:        	1) Transmit Channel    	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with  	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number  	    unrecoverable with just the family key    	2) Receive Channel    	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number  	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the  	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -  	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).    This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere is  a known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bits  as used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement block  can be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposed  Federal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,  The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bits  of N in E[N; F].    The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but the  mutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate the  entire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption scheme  such as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement block  can be recovered are lessened.    What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and the  serial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmission  becomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocol  transmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?    One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the block  containing M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.    The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to   detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the law  enforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original state  for use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.    It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained within  the clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,  requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before accepting  and decrypting E(M; K);    The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, including  on the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products could  be subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?    Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used without  redress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serial  number.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which should  not be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs for  procurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,  stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nice  from a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated with  a particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and   distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolen  clipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not   sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.  This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and or  spatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encrypted  stream.    Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementioned  scheme.    ******************************************************************************    If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and use  them in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a valid  law enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matching  the remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yet  deliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcement  block.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,  such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would require  escalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.    The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge of  clipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidated  by changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M stream  and the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure key  generator synchronized between endpoints.    The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limited  based on hostile forces using them as targets following transmission  interception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there's  supposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps to  the encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wants  an encryption chip with a real time clock?    *****************************************************************************    The entire idea of the law enforcement block can be invalidated.

Also, make sure that your  program can not be run out a debugger.    Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk,  just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here,  you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.  Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with  garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in  some random sector.    Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they  are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the  opposite of what you want.    Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the  machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can  think of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it  requests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should  be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything  else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once  again, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC  checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other  things, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a  change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the  program.  Tell them the program is ""VIRUS SECURE"", and remember, you have  helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.    I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.  Knock some cracking out (well, you can't  do it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in  the process!). Goodbye.

2,"     I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.     About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes   under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement   of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of   the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced   the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor    suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.     While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being    manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently   increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (   palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part   the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had   been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the   pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is    persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3   and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides   minor reductions in pain and is only short term.       My questions are:          Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the       levels of pain?         Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?         Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?        Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.            Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.      If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup    that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.                          --   Gregory W.

Neil Smith                       LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE    [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty --   and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with   the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]    Dear Adrian:      I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to   your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and   generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist   mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back   with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present   now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the   future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.      There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger   of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.   10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,   shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic   rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll   limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent   with your note.      First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't   alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my   interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.      Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't   support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions   anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older   body of lies, omissions, and distortions.      Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on   countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND   BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this   present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.      Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is   a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,   and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic   process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat   (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you   should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in   designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our   ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree   on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30   years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.    More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s   clearly indicate the contrary.      Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human   behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far  too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The   attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the   resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.      Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is   a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,   and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic   process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates   figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but   basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social   benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a   criminal offense.      Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials   quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are   many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless   because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it   wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that   anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,   whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's   permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists   themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed   people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".    Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity""   viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,   ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in   the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,   and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we   probably manufacture at least that many every year.    The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly   aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what   their real motives are.      Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,   it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;   the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the   self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing   this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a   quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life""   of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna   be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.    As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law   provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I   will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is   that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands   -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can   only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given   both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics   and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.      So what's the point?      L.

I said  everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the  victims of Holocaust. I wasn't implying that anyone suffered  more than the actual victims. Neither was I implying any  wrongdoing on the part of the Jews as the cause for the  Holocaust. What is wrong with you guys? Regardless of what one   says you keep hearing what you want to hear.  "

I really like these claims. Where did they come from? We hear,  practically daily, that the NSA monitors, oh, everything. They can  crack anything. They'd never release a cryptosystem they couldn't crack.    	Where do people get these fascinating facts? 'The Puzzle Palace'?  If you can get it for a buck, 2nd hand, it must be true, eh? I'm pretty  sure the NSA is supposed to, among many other things, provide high-quality  cryptosystems to a variety of places. I don't recall reading anywhere  reliable that they're supposed to:    	1) Monitor my phonecalls.  	2) Monitor usenet.  	3) Provide only cryptosystems they can easily crack.  	4) etc etc.    	This is not to say that they *don't*, they might. But you don't  know that they do, and you have no evidence that they do, for almost  all values of you. It follows, therefore, that for most values of 'you',  your claims about the NSA border on paranoia.    	Andrew   "

That you have to right to express whatever you  want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do  not impinge on the rights of others.    Encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that  particular text/sound/video.  Just like digitized sound is another   means of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of  continuous waveforms.    Also, it shouldn't be up to the government at all.  Encryption   _Standards_ can be decided upon by Independent Standards Orgainizations  (apologies for the acronym).  One can note how well this has worked  with ISO and the Metric System, SAE, etc.  Independent entities   or consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far  more qualified to set standards than any One government agency.  Consider for example what the Ascii character set would have looked  like if it was decided by the government.    I hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses.

It would be nice if, as you rightly point out the inherent value of  freedom of speech, discussion would also deal with the all-to-  frequent ritualized abuses and distortions of that freedom that do   occur.

Having watched most of the televised trial, I can answer that  when such statements were made by the defense atty, the prosecutor did  object, and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously  falling under the ""self-incrimination"" type of objection.  There was  quite a bit of meta-discussion during the trial over the use of graphic  language, with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the  exact language.  Practically every time the defense tried to get the  plaintiffs to ""self-incriminate"" by asking them such questions, there  were objections and sustains.    	At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about  ""solicitation for a felony"" and the judge herself said ""sustained""  before the prosecutor could get the objection stated.  --   G.

Let's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority  drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.    Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning.  I could go on with these examples for a long time....    Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks,  and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized,   imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be  free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was   good for them.    I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority,  is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in  his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all  common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay  my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government  taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.  This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people   by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have  equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and  medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of  beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered  night sky a right.    Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people?  The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail  than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.    Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution  you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole  life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see  squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live  for?      I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both.  I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.  That is why I consider an uncluttered night sky a right.

What is it?  What causes it?  Could it be caused by a  >nervous breakdown?  >   Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive  _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by  either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when  not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that  similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).      OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.      Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved  one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having   recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore  or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.    The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather  than being from an external source.    Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,  or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a  source of the anxiety.    In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the  individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their  daily routine and social relationships.    Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes  certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating  obsessions and compulsions.    The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the  DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .    						kind regards,    						todd  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+  | Todd I.

No, I'm not claiming 2,000,000 have been killed.  We are in the middle of  the genocide process that Mr. Major has given yet another ""green light""  to.  Mladic seems to have most of what he wants, but Boban is just  getting his appetite whetted. Because Mladic refuses to allow  international observers to inspect mass-grave sites and killing centers  in places like Foca, Brcko, and Visegrad, it will be years before we have  an accurate account of the number killed.     In practical terms, it would be impossible to kill all 2,000,000.  There  just isn't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and  transportation lines that the Nazis took 8 YEARS to develop.  And  remember, the Nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied.  To  actually kill 42% of the population requires extreme genocidal  organization.       But I do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic  annihilation of Bosnian Muslim culture, by killing as many as is  feasible, by rape, by torture, by the demolition of mosques, libraries,  and culture artificts, the burning and renaming of villages, the shelling  of civilians.  So that there won't be any of the 2,000,000 or so Muslims  whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide, though they still  may be alive.    And Mr. Major not only finds this acceptable, he helps it along by making  sure that the victims don't have arms to defend themselves.  >  >-Nick  >  Mike.  --  Michael Sells, Department of Religion, Haverford College  Haverford, Pa 19041-1392 "

After all most of its members  and leaders are former and current victims of government torture, injustice,  or relatives of victims. In some other places they get psychiatric care AND  revenge in the COURTS. But all they got is more of the same resulting  in a   cycle of madness that is initiated by the government with the illicit support   of the west who is more concerned about the safety of half naked tourists in  conservative neighborhoods than the dignity, social justice, and safety of the  majority of the poor oppressed people of Egypt. Enough said.    To all Apologists to the U.S imperialism: watch the movie ""Romero"" (1984)  three times in a row, that might help. (or shall I say 13 times?) "

2,"Nntp-Posting-Host: bode.ee.ualberta.ca                 What's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?    March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about  dimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-  control as the best method for controlling brightness.    I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing  filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had  heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by  cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's  power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then  nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has  tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. Any  advice is appreciated!    Ken      email: sidhu@bode.ee.ualberta.ca "

In fact, be-  fore BATSE, having this widely separated ""Interplanetary Network"" was the  only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot  locate a burst (except to say ""It's somewhere in the field of view."").  With  two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector  to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,  one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these  locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the   sky), voila, you have an error box.    BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,  but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like  to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-  pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.    You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe  (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen  in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be  a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss  neutron star...but this is getting too far afield.    Peter  peterf@oddjob.uchicago.edu   "

The whole ""saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia"" was nothing but US State  Department propeganda.  Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the   British created Kuwait.  They were trying to recover land they believed  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.  The Kuwaitis pushed  just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle  the dispute the old fashioned way...  Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq  together and concentrated on taking out Saddam.  A strong, united Iraq with  an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of  the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf.  But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy...    The US had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill-equipted Iraqi soldiers,  including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions  from the air in defense of Kuwaiti oil, but it has yet to lift a finger against  Bosnian Serbs while they slaughter Bosnian muslims....

1,"  FURY OF MOTHER NATURE    Man's contribution to environmental ""pollution"" are paltry compared to those   of nature. In her exceptional book TRASHING THE PLANET, former Atomic Energy   Commision Chairman Dr. Dixie Lee Ray notes based on the available data, ""all   of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the   industrial revolution do not begin to equal  the quantities of toxic   materials, aerosols, and particulates spewed into the air from just three   volcanoes: Krakatoa in Indonesia in 1883, Mount Katmai in Alaska in 1912, and   Hekla in Iceland in 1947."" To which could be added Mount St. Helens in   Washington State in 1980 (which pumped out 910,000 metric tons of carbon   dioxide alone). El Chicon in Mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million   tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere), and Mount Pinatubo in the   Philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into   the stratosphere).  LOS NINOS  Many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the U.S. to global   warming, but researchers with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in   Boulder Colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a   natural phenomenon, the interaction of El Nino and El Nina, two massive   currents in the tropical Pacific. El Nino is a huge strip of warm water that   periodically appears off the coast of South America and disrupts the world's   weather patterns. Now and then, it alternates with El Nina, a mass of cold   water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for   thousands of miles.  CHICAGO TRIBUNE'S  Peter Gorner summarized the phenomenon: ""Cold water along   the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of Hawaii. The   result was both the U.S. drought and the devastating floods that swamped   Bangladesh...... Nina's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and   distorted the path of the Jet Stream across North America. Then the Jet   Stream shoved rain-producing weather systems away from the interior of the   U.S. resulting in drought.""  TERMITE TERROR    Sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental   ""degradation. TIME for April 20,1992 noted that in ""the Netherlands... manure   from pigs poses a major ecological threat, defiling water supplies with   excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. Sheep have permanently scarred   the landscape in Spain and Portugal, while in India ... bovines [cows] are   ravenous wraiths whose constant quest  for food drives them to ravage   standing forrests.""  The February 1983 issue  of SCIENCE DIGEST reported that ""an international   team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the   Carbon Dioxide  that fuel burning does."" According to a study reported in   SCIENCE for November 5, 1982, the ""estimated gross amount of Carbon Dioxide   produced [by termites] was more than twice the net global input from fossil   fuel combustion."" In addition, ""Termites are a potentially important source   of atmospheric methane: they could account for a large fraction of global   emmisions."" The wood-eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too   digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too Carbon Dioxide,   methane, and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.  Ants are another natural source of ""pollution."" In 1987, an atmospheric   chemist with Bell Laboratories, and zoologists from Cornell University,   reported that ants of the subfamily FORMICINAE make and store huge quantities   of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in   remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the   globe. It is abundant, for instance, in the fog and mists that hang over the   rain forests of Central Africa. According to the July 6, 1987 INSIGHT   magazine, the ""ants release the acid when defending themselves and   communicating with each other and upon dying. Since  30 percent of the world   ant population belongs to this subfamily, there is significant concern about    the acid the ants release,"" an amount estimated at ""600,000 metric tons   annually."" which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of   automobiles, refuse combustion and vegetation.""  Clearly, man has a long way to go to match nature as a ""despoiler"" of the   environment.  By Robert W. Lee.      ------  techie@cellar.org (William A Bacon)  The Cellar BBS - (215) 539-3043 "

They can take their forces which are  incomponent and ineffective at the first place.  And let whoever are  willing to do the job what it takes.  How anyone can defend this  stinking UN force on the ground who let the Bosnnian PM  yanked out from the UN vehicle and being shot by the Serbian  military?  How anyone can defend this UN force who are just watching  the shelling on cities and towns everyday?  How anyone can  defend and say those stinking UN forces being effective  when Bosnian had almost 14,000 children casualties between 5-14 age   groups?  I think talking about the current UN forces to Bosnian  muslims is just an insult to their casualties.       I think Senator Biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.  Europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this   world.  Like Biden said, they are the bigots when it comes to   cultural difference and minorty closer to their home.  Because they get rid of their minorities long long time  ago starting in 15th centuries.  And they let Adolph  to take care of the rest in 20th Century.  But he was much more   naughty than they expected because he dared to step many   toes.  So, why spoil the good thing now when Serbs doing today what   they were thinking the same yesterday.    C.

2,"  I'm wondering if ""vandalize"" is the proper word to use in this situation.  My  dictionary defines ""vandalism"" as ""the willful or malicious destructuion of   public or private property, especially of anything beautiful or artisitc."" I  would agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property.    I personally prefer natural skies, far from city lights and sans aircraft.    However, there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the  sky and see a satellite.  Many people get a real kick out of it, especially if  they haven't seen one before.     --   Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu  		    ""Find a way or make one.""  	             -attributed to Hannibal "

As soon as you possibly can.  The  difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery  and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety  doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,  any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in  these kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.

Pronation: Turning the palm down.    Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.    Supination: Turning the palm up.    Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.    Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.    Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.    Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.    Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.    Abduction: Moving away from the body.    Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.    Now then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse  conditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,  tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.  Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle  discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of  tenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily ""the problem.""    --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.    Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which  pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict  the blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,  you're completely restricting your blood flow.    Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,  then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates  nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.    Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the  load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes  things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,  and the cycle continues.    Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from  your nerves.  They need blood too.    Anyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change  for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never  relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor  ergonomics, only make things worse.    --- Specific injuries you may have heard of:    (note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute  injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have  less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)    Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis  occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to  cause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability  to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets  inflamed, and you've got your problem.    Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon  can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,  and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more  swelling, and more pain.  ""Sub-acute"" tendonitis is more common, which entails  a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse  with repetitive activity.    Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your  fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include  feeling ""pins and needles"", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.  CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.    Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where  the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly  compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.  AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS   disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy   (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).    Others: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for  a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS  conditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors  misdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you  may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion  before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).    ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment    The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce  tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.  If you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out  the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding  principle in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.  EVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every  three minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,  calm down, and relax.    If you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and  relaxation are really a big deal.    There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce  inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad  posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen  your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture  and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold  contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best  for you.    --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was  written in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from  Appendix 10. -- dwallach]    . Let your shoulders relax.  . Let your elbows swing free.  . Keep your wrists straight.  . Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.  . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.  . Try leaning back in the chair.  . Don't slouch or slump forward.  . Alter your posture from time to time.  . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.    Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There   should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,  and your thighs should not slope too much.    Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable  to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy  is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a  footrest.    Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space  between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in  the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this  area.    If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning  back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.    [Now, I diverge a little from the text]    A good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go  find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,  back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in  the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm  rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good  store and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.  In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend ""Just Chairs.""  The  name says it all.    --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:    There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some  people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you  shouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your  keyboard to be ""right there"".  If you drop your arms at your side and then  lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands  when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid  pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads  may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and  look at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's  often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or  deviated hands.    Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly  designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.  Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.    ==5== Requests for more info    Clearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive  is incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like  to submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.    If you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be  wonderful!  I'd love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I'd  love somebody to make a list of doctors.  I'd love somebody to edit the  above sections, looking for places where I've obviously goofed.    ==6== References    I completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful  guide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health  Service, a service of their Department of Labour.

There must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  It  seems that many of these Lebanese youth are unable to restrain  themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions  prolong Israels stay in South Lebanon.    	If the Lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then  Israel would not have to be there.

Israel should withdraw from Lebanon when a peace treaty is  signed.  Not a day before.  Withdraw because of casualties would tell  the Lebanese people that all they need to do to push Israel around is  kill a few soldiers.  Its not gonna happen.    >Along with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah  >be disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not   >accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a  >shelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone  >and will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.      	Why should Israel not demand this while holding the buffer  zone?  It seems to me that the better bargaining position is while  holding your neighbors land.  If Lebanon were willing to agree to  those conditions, Israel would quite probably have left already.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the Lebanese can disarm the  Hizbolah, and maintain the peace.

When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to   power last year, he announced he would be be ""swimming in Lake Sevan [in   Armeniaxn] by July"". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the   Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey   is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If   Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of   Kelbajar, his people will pay the price.     It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they  are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just   look at the situation with the Lezgians.    About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there   are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there   are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this ""60   Kurd refugee"" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in   Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border   with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the ""intercepting"" of Armenian military   conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by   somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed   ""special correspondent"" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!    [h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane   [h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one  [h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane  [h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.  [h]    No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.    [HE]	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes  [HE]	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities  [HE]	announced that they were going to search these cargo   [HE]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.  [HE]	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of  [HE]	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not  [HE]	humanitarian aid.....    Your ""facts"" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey   have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes  were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments   were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey  for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was  confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with ""crap"" and dirt, then  shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.  uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which  they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish   chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed   anything other than a paranoid Turkish military.     [HE]	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.  [HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons?     Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan  from Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused!

There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.

2,"  I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific   brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machines  consist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls them.  They strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing  LEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are available.  I've heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states for  relaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc...  I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful,  The few sources I've seen are biased (they are selling the things, and a  friend who has tried them claims that ""every home should have one""). So   do these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induce  alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research if  any has been done on them? Could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer?  Or are they just another bit of quackery?    Web Homer    homer@tripos.com    "

The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.    This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior  to us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced  and therefore ""more intelegent"" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there  is life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.

My question however was  more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars  and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign  countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night.  Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved  these issues on our own?      But... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided  that certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior  to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no  homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and  more.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm  the land and go to church on sunday?  --   Have a day,      @   @     ( )     bobo "

There is one point I'd like to make, that most people seem to have forgotten.  That is that one of the underlining principles in the Constitution is a DISTRUST  of governmental authority and control. All those ""checks & balances"" is because  they realize that you should distrust those in power. What everyone seems to have  forgotten as well is the original reason that the Bill of Rights guaranteed the  right to bear arms. It's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself  against other citizens, but to prevent the government from taking away your only  means of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government. Its hard to  oppress your citizenry when its armed against you.    I am not a fanatic, I'm a retired Naval officer. Because I have spent so much  time defending it, perhaps I understand its ""purpose"" as well as its ""plan"".    Lance Kimes "

Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire did  not break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD would  be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are  pumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire   seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the  very high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it  could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.      Which puts us back to the FBI did it, or the BD did it, or some other screw-  up occured, which is quite possible.      The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires  *everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  While they tended to behave   like total idiots, that does not make them homocidal maniacs, either.  And if  it was one nutcase agent, then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency.      I can believe that a real nut-case like a Koresh would start such a fire,  but I'm far from convinced he actually did so.

Point 1:    I'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole  ""yeast issue"" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings  of words.  Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized ""jargon"",  necessary for precise communication within their field (which I'm fully  cognizant of since I, too, speak ""jargonese"" when with my peers).  For the  situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can  have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the  world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,  and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of ""systemic"".  It is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much  more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of  this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially  equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan  the flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get  really ""beat up"" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they  otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional  ""difficult"" patient.    Point 2:    I understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not  prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments  have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed  clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are  part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any  differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it  follows that any therapy not on the ""accepted"" list is therefore a non-  therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or  theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation  of what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from  a treatment point-of-view.    And by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/  science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as  also being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people  that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where  ""standard"" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and  wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid ""scientific"" viewpoint is in  itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying  intent of the ""scientific"" approach to medicine is to protect the health of  the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the  patient should come first when considering treatment.    What we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both  the ""scientific"" and the ""humanitarian"" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I  outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any  physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe  alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)  for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted  (and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such  therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that  there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived  from them.    This approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies  the humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients  who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted  medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the  doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing  their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical  training.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control  more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned  could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most  productive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I'm  sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented  more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.    Hopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to  why I am ""open"" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real  difficulty (read ""apparent hostility"") with the ""coldness"" of the 99.9% pure  ""scientific"" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical  treatment is one where both the ""humanitarian"" aspects are balanced with and  by the ""scientific"" aspects.  Anything else is just not good medicine, imho.

We had a most peculiar  little locomotive, originally built in America for the Russian  Government, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered  truck as men's quarters; one similar, which I fitted up for my-  self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three  cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. With this  small outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before  our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly  coming to a head, it being evident that the Turks were becoming~  more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of  the Allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the  future.    Travelling on this little ""war-time"" railway was indeed an  experience, and it was necessary to carry a ""gauge,"" and to  test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to  the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the  ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to  get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re-  quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon  it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim-  ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts  whilst we passed over them.    Under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog-  ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt  also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we  had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day,  60 hours and 70 miles out from Erzeroum, we finally entered the  gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles  to lie. This is the same gorge into which the road from  Erzeroum to Kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the  frontier; the railway, however, follows the main Aras River val-  ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the  corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of Zivin,  some 15 miles from the main valley.    Soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the  first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from  the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track.

2,"  FLAME ON    Reading through the posts about Kirlian (whatever spelling)  photography I couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the  narrow-minded, ""I know it all"", ""I don't believe what I can't see or  measure"" attitude of many people out there.    I am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to  so-called ""paranormal"" stuff; but as far as I'm concerned, it is just  as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be  quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.    I am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to  something, ANYTHING, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame  of reference. History shows that many great people, great scientists,  were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics.    Especially the USA should be grateful; after all, Columbus did not  drop off the edge of the earth.    FLAME OFF, or end sermon :-)    -- Alex "

The biased presentation of facts, as well as the conclusions that  you reach leave me little hope of engaging in any fruitful  exchange that might lead to a ""meeting of the minds"".  It is to those  who read with open mind, that I address myself.    %The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of  %Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the  %United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member  %states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial  %discrimination as ""any distinction, exclusion, restriction or  %preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic  %origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing  %the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of  %human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,  %social, cultural or any other field of public life.""    While the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,  as the text currently stands I know of no country in which  racial discrimination of some sort can not be found.  It makes no mention of the need for for a legislative  violation.    %The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining  %Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The  %important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since  %it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli  %racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of  %Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United  %Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial  %practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.    If you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative  statements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be  applied to any other case where the council perceives some form  of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.    Scarey thought.    %The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of  %the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native  %non-Jews born in that country.     Actually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not  alienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be  correct, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes  apparent.  This slant permeates the text.    %Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas  %under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most  %of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the  %author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.    The above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting  Beduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.  Your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the  issue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].    %Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It's aim  %was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant  %opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).    If I recall correctly, at the time ""zionism"" took off, there  was no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any  factual contradictory evidence .    %But the  %Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and  %technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the  %area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native  %Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and  %razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could  %finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000  %non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.    Do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on ""most  of their villages""?    %Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to  %help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their  %political repression and their destitution.    There is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later  used for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the  intention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was  that this was not the case.    You also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded  this.  As you do again, below.    %In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied  %the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus  %another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its  %occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered  %illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security  %Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and  %began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these  %territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.    Not quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,  though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.  Israel never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other  annexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.    %Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,  %have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of  %international law and UN resolutions.    Out of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,  what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories  captured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country  previously (other than Iraq) ?    %It must be emphasized that, although these people live under  %different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as  %Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a  %territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).    Incorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against  on an ""ethnic or racial"" basis.  Therefore your above statement is  incorrect.    I also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,  the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.  However, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist  at the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not  argue racial discrimination during that period!    %Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a  %symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that  %represents them in world affairs.    Once again, some do, some don't.    %The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab  %territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant  %discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.    Another generalization, but then again, you don't seem to care  about anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you  espouse.    %licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the  %right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject  %to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be  %challenged in court.    Incorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.  Furthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all  of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some  are, but this is not due to the ""whims"" of the military as  much as the sizeof the task/organization.    %Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied  %territories are permitted to carry firearms.    Incorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in  Daheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of  the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.    %Jewish settlers have  %right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents  %of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel  %governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in  %total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will  %of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates  %land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish  %settlement.    That is no longer true, and I can't help but wonder what your  purpose is/was in posting this.    %Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them  %consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For  %many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected  %to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by  %the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish  %settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and  %humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to  %vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in  %practice.    Once again, to hell with the other minorities that don't fit in,  right?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way  you seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but  as a result of what actions?    %Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the  %Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are  %second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on  %such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these  %policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied  %residence and membership rights in most rural communities in  %Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews  %are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government  %starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of  %funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;  %Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their  %non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and  %understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian  %children are denied the right to learn their history and  %literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end  %of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the  %authorities.    1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.      It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no      legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish      collective.    2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind      that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has      never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large      bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case       in point.    3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation      with regard to educational material.  You have obviously      never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.      It is based upon Jordan's school system.    4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another      gross generalization.      %The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of  %all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never  %openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the  %country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its  %ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards  %non-Jews bear the mark of this 'Final Solution'. No attempt is  %made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs  %into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately  %17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen  %of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of   %ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme  %Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in  %Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the  %Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.    Another generalization, but lets not stop here.  The transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't,  Moledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the  territories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,  I recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered  previously.    %Although sexual  %relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,  %they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal  %of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system  %nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.    When was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,  nor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious  intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and  the lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.    %Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on  %equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has  %not produced any written Constitution.     Simply incorrect.  The answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the  dynamics and movements inside Israeli gov't, relegates your  contentions to the sidelines.    %Zionism predicates a state  %where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,  %a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak  %Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli  %citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be  %Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial  %discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only  %reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the  %very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.    But the discrimination is not based upon race.  Oops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.    %Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that  %does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -  %that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed  %to fail.    Real world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.  Of course, I wouldn't expect you to understand, wrapped up as  you are in your VIEW of things.  Let's not let anything penetrate  shall we!?!

Oh, you definitely have a choice.  You realize, of course, that you  are approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade.  How are  you planning on celebrating two years of lies?    Incidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans,  women, and other minorities who also want to ""impose their morality on  others"".  After all, they also want the government to ""tell peaceful  people how to live.""  Therefore, you really ""have no choice"", but to  continue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not  a lifestyle, but a sickness.    It's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.  It was bullshit when you began this crusade  and it's still bullshit.  I am continually amazed at the depths to which  you'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.

Can we perhaps as the  question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal  to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written  with something else in mind and ""propoganda"" put out by its supporters.

That  would seem to be irrelevent.    >The  >difficulty that most US posters seem to have is in considering that their  >arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies.            Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe  they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were  good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because  they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't  think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.    >If they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to  >express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary  >and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required.

Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political  system, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this  particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure  and tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)    >|>       If the Senate was less powerful than the House of Lords, than  >|>we'd almost have to state that the House of Representatives was also.  >|>(In fact, they both were, because the British government had much  >|>greater power than did the American system).         >  >In principle no, in practice yes.

Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While  the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although  badly) to the U.S. President.            Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives  is ""in principle"" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)  but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the  Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh  darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put  those extra restrictions on the Senate in?    >|>       I disagree.

These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level  >instead.           Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell  you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of  government to ""attack"" which presents them with the best chance of  getting what they want.  With national ""interest groups"" it is simply  a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a  law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less   ""contributions"" to make.            Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at  the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little  state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,  medicine, and most other questions.          Local government has not ""failed"" in that it hasn't done what it  should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local  interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their  rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,  only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because  it can impose its will on the lower.          I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres  of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-  and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed  to a local crime?          The more people want the more Congress will take power to ""sell""  it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of ""special interests""  is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.    >|>       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than  >|>enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its  >|>original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.  >  >If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current   >""no state subsidy motto"" they would be better placed.

The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual  need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher  levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to  in effectiveness.    >In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the  >other 49 states with pork - defense contracts, agricultural subsidies etc.  >Or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster.           Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I  remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable  of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if  you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the ""pork"" in that  state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power  and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get  what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.           The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must ""buy off""  states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.    >|>       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,  >|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically  >|>wanted to avoid.

But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself   that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres  has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact  national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem  is significantly reduced.    >The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility  >to come to a decision.            The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable  to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering  the government the usually the institution with the sole power to  enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those  decisions a good thing.    >Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't  >work unless the lower levels are less corrupt. In most cases they are worse,  >not better.           The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have  more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution  than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is  harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing  new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out  without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the  entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different  areas, different solutions may be called for.           And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local  and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to  the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the  majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end  up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in  Washington with half a million or more constituents.           I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels  are more corrupt.      >|>       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were  >|>placed on the veto.

Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were  arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators  should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was  suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was  nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.  Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders  wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,  I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,  which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for  the House.    >The   >US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work. The  >only part where a reason is given is the right to bear arms ammendment where   >the well regulated militia justification is ambiguous.           The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration  of Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other  examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the  reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)    >That the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the   >fact of the senate.

Furthermore  >the separation of powers would have been much less distinct.            To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something  it wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering  the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they  want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying  about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which  almost necessitates its abuse.    >|>       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power  >|>regarding what a bill is for.

Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system  against action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when  dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have  not been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal  power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to  got through something more than a bare majority    >|>       Why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which  >|>covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living  >|>in radically different conditions?

No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority  for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population  groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities  should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough  about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority  being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing  the *federal* system against action.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------  David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Is the U used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the  call, from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first,  or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field?  Even assuming  one of the first two choices, the FBI is going to get a fresh N,U for its  own database about every other phone call, eventually accumulating keys for  all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring, not just  the 'suspects' key.

2,"  My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112  to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, just  wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.    I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there  are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.    My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver ""back  end"" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'm  particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any  current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a  normal IF filter can be used?

I have heard of rubber or  plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the  intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also  seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].   Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the  gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to   be a proper reaction [and so does the law].     Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force  has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the  less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some  risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent   since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be  more deadly.    --   Michael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..

Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme  is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,  either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme  like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared  session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone  company or some other online central authority generates a session key and  sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of  having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for  a copy of the session key for each call.        Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of  every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will  be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-  signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,  stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to  everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the  security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your  designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.        It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to  use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair  and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call  most people and establish secure communications....        --John Kelsey  >I hope somebody starts doing this soon after the first  >ones are released...

But to add to this  explaniation, each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe, just so  the detector does not read the background radiation(i.e. cosmic rays),   if I remember right, the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the   background.  This is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays  that would normally set it off. Even with this buffer, they still have to throw  out something like 1/2 of the bursts that they DO get, because of the Earth's  Van Allen Belts, the South Atlantic Anomaly, the Sun,  if I remember right,  there is either a radar station, or a radio station in Australia, and there are  a couple other sources as well.                                                    -jeremy                                                  belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu       "

0,"  Clipper might be a good way to cover the use of another layer of  encryption.    Currently, when you send an encrypted message, an opponent can usually  tell 1) that you are using encryption 2) which encryption method you  are using [because that information is usually in the clear].    With clipper, most opponents will only know that you are sending  clipper-text, they won't know that your clipper-text is itself  encoded.    Only those few opponents who get your clipper-keys will know  that your message is double encrypted.    ... kind of like a safety deposit box containing a lock box.    So, don't just think of replacements for clipper, also think of front  ends.    - Carl        --   Carl Kadie -- I do not represent EFF; this is just me.   =kadie@eff.org, kadie@cs.uiuc.edu = "
0,"  For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2  Meg banks of 16 bit data.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a  DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the  controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.    The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National  Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would  like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to  implement in my circuit.    BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas  Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer  Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM  memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the  power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use  this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).

1,"  This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.  ==============================================================  Hi Folks;    Wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening  statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,  each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.    The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to  Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the ""evil"" federal  government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal  agents ""sawed off"" shotguns and later failed to appear for  trial: Despite repeated ""good faith"" efforts to get Weaver  to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted  when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and  began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people  were taking an ""offensive action"" against an FBI helicopter  when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.    The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern  Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted  simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to  sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution  alleged, want to become a ""regular supplier"").  The defense also  argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when  he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,  but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist  angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The  failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given  an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.  The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed  Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver  then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal  agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,  there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:  However, agents were near the body for an extended period of  time and could have played with the select-fire - this will  have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims  that Vicki Weaver was only going to ""look at the body"" [not recover?]  of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.    Prosecution quote: ""Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made  that confrontation."" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist    Defense quote: ""The evidence in this case is going to show that  this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged  with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that  the government did commit.""  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]    Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters  heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests  outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate  again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including  ""Tim"" again.  ""Tim"" claimed he was a skinhead, who were ""ordinary,  working class people.""  He also claimed he was for ""white pride,  not white power.""    Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview  with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly  what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.    In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about  a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the  courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence  in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some  tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent  were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they  believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,  repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the  defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the  recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the ""sawed  off"" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another  good one!).    Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to  begin presenting evidence.

Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley  in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted   as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't  consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though  the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the ""gun owner"" column.    >       In either case, this means the 'average  > 	threat level' in this country is rather low.     Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The ""average threat  level"" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well  known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because   they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to  Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the   ""average threat level in the country"" means to a resident there.    > 	I think you have weapons on the brain.

Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors   on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once  told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the  original text, but the story started with one resident calling the   cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a   drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time,  unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting  an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.    Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane,  your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell  anything.    > 	In short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at  > 	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.  > 	Replace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better  > 	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a  > 	block party.     Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.    That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches   on the carpet.

Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to  believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun   ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T   any.

In the mid-80's, they ran a ""One   Million Strong!"" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.    My understanding is that they ""reached"" it by the stratagem of including  wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak  authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they  started running a ""Two Million Strong!"" campaign for a while -- but they  let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they  simply were never going to reach that level of membership.    In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting  point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.    By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had   about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the  third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).  And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical  figures from Kukla's ""Gun Control,"" pp. 61 and 420.)    As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused  by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against   hard-core gun banners.    I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members.  I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.    Yes, I think we can and will win this one.    > 	Firearms-related mindless mayhem will be related to the  > 	availibility of firearms.

The meetings were part of ""Space VLBI Week"" held at JPL in  early March and were intended to maintain cooperation between  international space agencies participating in the development of  the U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flight  project set for launch in 1995.       U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft  -- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellite  with its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON  10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up with  ground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create  a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio  telescope observing power by a factor of 10.       Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to  conduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft  will exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory  radio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for  roughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio  telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object  while within view on Earth.       According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL's project manager for the  U.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit  Japan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio  interferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio  astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex  observations required by the Space VLBI project.       ""One of our main activities is developing the methodology  for international coordination, because the two spacecraft  simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while  using the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same  celestial objects,"" said Smith.       Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN  facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in  Japan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of  ground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and  high-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the  information to a correlator located at the National Radio  Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will  combine and process data, then make it available to mission  investigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.       Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created  by the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with  better resolution than has ever been achieved before by  ground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a  closer look at distant objects in space.       ""There is a long history of radio astronomy using  ground-based telescopes,"" said Smith. ""What we intend to do is to  extend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look  deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other  active radio sources to understand what drives those things we  have seen so far with radio astronomy.""       Smith noted that if one examines ""the active galactic  nuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than  light, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater  than you would expect.""       He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be  located in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel  the jets. Smith hopes that ""by using Space VLBI to look further  into the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.""       Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and  transmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and  Japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this  year. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and  engineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA  Correlator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd  data patterns that will originate from the more than 20  ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.       Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the  Japanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at  JPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the  political uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country's  participation in the project.       ""Nothing is ever smooth,"" he said, ""but the Russians have  been incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some  likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors  beyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these  things going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,  and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.""       Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at  stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a  science mission.       ""The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since  international cooperation is essential to their science mission,""  he said.       But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials  look at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase  the technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly  regarded Mach V launch vehicle.       Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an  ambitious project, JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for the  Space VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and  political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.       ""Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and  if either falls out, we would still have something with the  other. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,  scientifically exciting missions.""                             ###       ___    _____     ___      /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov      | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |   ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand  /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and  |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

All the clamor   over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical   trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against   cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective,   treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals   are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to   use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due   to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden   Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize   the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use   and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to   restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is   yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care   patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just   because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that   all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be   found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known   for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a   women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and   not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida   colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common   than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.    The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by   a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is   warrented.    Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There   has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is   kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been   done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the   intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones   from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to   breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of   Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong,   increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is   restricting calcium intake.    The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to   be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.  If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans   David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider   yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as   Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast   infections should decline.    Marty B. "

My interpretation of Denning's description is that S1 and S2 are chosen  randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300-  chip programming session.  I imagine that the chips are in a carrier which  will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not be  a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little PLA programmer as some  people have envisioned.    My guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the  S1 and S2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in-principle) checkable  way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers  used to generate the keys.  Since we have to trust the escrow companies  anyway, it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from  random seeds entered by the escrow agents.  And since the algorithm for  key-generation is public (modulo Skipjack secrecy) then in principle an  agent could challenge the procedure, ask for S1 and S2 to be exposed, and  run his own independent calculation of U1 and U2 to verify that that is  what is actually being put onto the floppies.    And yes, there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could  be hard to check.  The laptop probably will not really be destroyed each  time.  Hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the S1 and S2 entered by  the trusted escrow agents.  Back doors in the chip could allow U to be  recovered.  Heck, each chip could be recorded with the same U, ignoring  what was on the floppy.    Hal Finney "

It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one  of reasonable quality).

Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled  rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten  times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.  resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and  buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs  and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban   can not be easily side-stepped.    > >To show why the tools argument is the silliest i have ever seen.. take an  > >analogy from computer science... almost every computer science major  > >can write a ""wordprocessor"" yet we(comp sci majors)  would willingly pay 3    > >to 400 bucks for a professional software like wordperfect... why don't we    > >just all write our own software???......

The degree of  elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times  normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.   As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.   Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at  least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of  a biopsy.

Any  discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the  sole qualification for religious membership is racial. This is not the  case for Israel although it might get a little closer than, say, Islam.  This of course raises the vexed question of Church AntiSemitism.

2,"  Hello,    Can somebody tell me what kind of MOV's are most useful for a computer  surge protector?  Radio Shack have 2 types, both rated 130V, one for  a 10A current and the other for 20A.  On the other hand, commercial surge  protectors I have seen claim a clamping voltage of 330V-400V, which SEEMS to  me in imply a rated voltage of about 250V (250V * SQRT(2.)=353).    What is the right kind?    While at it, ow important is really the EMI/RFI module?  Is there really any  noticable level of such noise in the power line?

You can clean up the circuit to trim  out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show  up as carrier feed-through).

Now, I for one, am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it    that all Jews think this way. Sure, there might be some, but this view is not    a part of Judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this    twisted. However, some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a    reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and    are racists.    For this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out    against what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the    anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do    *not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all    Jews. Yet they are missing that chance. Remember, to many people, silence    implies consent.

Was it not a state?    Yes because it has always had that power. The constitution limits the areas  in which the government can exercise power. The constitution can be changed  however and has been frequently. For example during prohibition the   government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state had  the capacity to change the constitution to enable this.    The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictate  the manner in which power is exercised. No piece of paper can prevent  abuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidate  for opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,    The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful arms  control measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who could  prevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the power  of the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. This  is the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern because  the people with the guns think that they have the right to decide the  law.      |>>You have a very confused notion of what a state is.

The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is which  date from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countries  were much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN - organisations  where individual members had significant powers in their own right and  did not derive their power from a central authority.    |> The  |>canonical example of non-governmental law is probably the Law  |>Merchant, which others can expound upon better than I.  But it was  |>certainly enforced in non-state courts for some time, although state  |>courts, being subsidized, later were able to effectively enter the  |>arbitration business.    But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rules  and regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state   was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectively  made in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which is  a non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so however  within the framework laid down by the government.    In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. If  you were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw the  monarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very short  time. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit Royal  Charters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required   authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authority  to be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case of  misbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to remove  privillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently established  through a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favours  without recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolish  the house of lords for example.    Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the   ""common law"" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is law  made by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else is  common law.      Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. For  example a judgment in common law made in England can effect the   interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once in  the Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example a  lot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevance  to UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning that  lies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus if  a judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law in  one jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with no  guiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime which  they might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The law  should be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions without  precedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is   superior in UK law.

As I understand, these are all short term.    I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say  what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say  how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for  months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are   every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.  Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start  azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug  in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics  about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of   disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it  is worth.      I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good   patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things  can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and  Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637  info hotline.    Best of Luck to you.

(WITH-COUNTERFLAME-ENABLED     Columbus was indeed a crank, but not in the manner you think.     The fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail.  It was   also well known that the circumference was about 25K miles, and that you could   not reach Asia bo going west with current technology -- you would neither be   able to carry enough supplies, nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing   weather.  Nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world.  Instead,   they expected him to die at sea.     Columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16K miles,   making the trip practical.     Unfortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, the Earth's circumference is   indeed 25K miles.     Fortunately for Columbus and his shipmates, there was a stopping place right   about where Asia would have been had the circumference been 16K miles.

PDT    	     	    	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you   could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll   give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)  	       	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the   Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government   money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the   government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going   to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian   businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What   are the priorities, because there are several association of   Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to   participate in setting up priorities for investment?    	       	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know   that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans   are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls   say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times   published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war;   42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent   if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to   sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not   very enthusiastic?  Thank you.  	       	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going   to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the   answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is,   it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example,   the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will   obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be   good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will   be used to support the privatization of existing public   enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the   Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have   some influence over the distribution of.    	       	     With regard to your second question, let me say that   I would think that there would be people in both countries who   would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government   giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to   that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history   there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That   is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole   history of America, any kind of aid program has always been   unpopular.    	       	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is   this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that   this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --  trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments   because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in   Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them   working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies   going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it   possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the   economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and   investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce   nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on   our side and on the Russian side.    	       	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an   investment for the United States.  This is very much in the   interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the   second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next   week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for   the taxpayers and workers of my country.    	       	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some   partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share   her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view   this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not   what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful   investment.    	       	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But   there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than   the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier   of the Cold War.  	       	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very   much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory   of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American   President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind   of a very measured breakthrough.    	       	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory   remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief   that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you   tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to   what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification   of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how   confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager   to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions   inherited from the Cold War?    	       	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of   Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with   regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent   states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States   develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing   that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of   the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude   our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that   would provide not only an important economic opportunity for   Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out   on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed   off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and   we agreed to continue to press that.  	       	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to   reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the   Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the   United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine,   but that, in order to do what we need to do together to   strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States   be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join   the NPT regime is critical.  	       	     What was the second question?    	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and   COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the   Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will,   as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other   restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on   relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies   of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of   them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the   leadership of the Congress.  	       	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be   an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there   are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to   emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there   is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed   to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be   much less.  	       	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing   more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my   own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement   out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to   begin it in the fairly near future.  	       	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in   Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely   different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not   political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of   Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the   difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the   difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of   Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the   last part of your speech?  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to   compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say   what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a   boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the   music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been   thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music   for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists   and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know   as much as I could about your history.    	       	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then   the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last   presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone   in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr.   Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I   was following events there very closely and hoping for the day   when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a   personal feeling about Russia.    	       	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like   music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a   musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York   Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony   to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly   than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically   so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it   occurred.    	       	     These are things that have always had a big impact   on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever   had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two   countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)  	       	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.                                   END3:06 P.M. PDT       "

2,"          Press Release No.19-93  Paris, 22 April 1993    Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of  their experiments    ""Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not  be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided  a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s"". This  summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300  participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in  Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by  the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for  the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).    OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :  -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of         new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small         antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested         data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,         distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few         examples.    -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services         which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-         frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over         Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.    -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS         received for the first time in Europe, over several months,         high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and         then distributed it to various centres in Europe.    When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the  world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other  satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four  different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.    OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some  of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is  given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or  services; over the past four years some 200 companies and  organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over  100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning  organisation.        As the new technologies and services tested by these  OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then  make use of operational satellites such as those of  EUTELSAT.    OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994,  when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the  end of its design life.            "

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I  ask this again:    1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be     I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?    2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies     hole currents over normal electron currents?    3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of     hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual     test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,     don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,     resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,     magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).    NOTES:       to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area     where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole     particles only exist in the presence of matter.     Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain     semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if     the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point     where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).     I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether     holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for     an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such     currents *if* they exist.     Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics     since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.    Thanx,  Eric.    ----   ET   ""A Force of Nature""  ---- "

You are supposed to train with a .22 for the 6 months, THEN  you can start with anything bigger.    Drivers licence:  Forgot that USA is THE land of cars.....  Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy.  Average time is about 20 hours of training, and the cost is rather......  But we think this is acceptable because a car is NOT a toy, and  bad drivers tend to hurt OTHERS.  (If you are really bad, you WON'T get a lincence!)    Abuse by the goverment:  This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control  would just be abused by the goverment.(!)  Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should  get a new goverment. (You do have elections??)    Guns 'n Criminals:  MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.  Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.  And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),  we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.    Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:  What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!  Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to...  I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)    The issue (I hope..):  I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.  Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)    I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:  They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them  to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.    If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them  or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,  it's the 'axer' ??  (An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)    Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect  themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??    If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have  guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)    Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works  (in England) and fonds from USA are one of the reasons why IRA can bomb innocents...  (Something about throwing stones in glass houses...)  Don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either.  (Can an Jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace??) (YES!)    (My numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot-guns are from the police  and the Statistisk Sentralbyraa) (understood that one Sorenson??)

Her  neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound  headaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  She stopped taking all  analgesics and caffine as of last Thursday (4/15).  The weekend was pretty  bad, but she made it through with the help of Imitrex about every 18 hours.   Her third injection of Imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on  Friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick.  Skin  was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  It subsided  in an hour or so.  Since then, she has been taking Imitrex as needed to  control the pain.  Immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain  for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  A friend  of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of Imitrex because it had caused  heart attacks in several people.  Apparently the mild chest pains were  common in these other people prior to there attacks.  Is this just rumor?   Has anyone else heard of these symptoms?

0,"  I'm attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the  proposed wiretap (or ""Clipper"") chip is a cost-effective tool for  police investigation.  That is, ignoring concerns about government  intrusions into individual privacy, is the value of easy wiretaps to  investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry,  and their customers, to support this wiretap technology?      A rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million  dollars per year to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  (In 1990, 872 U.S.  wiretaps led to 2057 arrests, while total police expenditures of $28  billion led to 11.25 million arrests [ref US Statistical Abstracts].)  I'm working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately, but  I'd like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating  the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology.    Please send me quotable/citeable estimates for:    - How many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all    phones with wiretap chips?  - How much would it cost to make each chip?  - How much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place?  - How much more would supporting hardware, people, etc. cost, per chip?  - What percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been    if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs?  - What percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed    ""law enforcement blocks""?  - What is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year?    Put another way, the question I'm asking is, what if each police  agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it, being  charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication  to be wiretap compatible?  Would they choose to buy such wiretaps, or  would they find it more cost-effective to instead investigate crimes  in other ways?  --   Robin Hanson  hanson@ptolemy.arc.nasa.gov   415-604-3361  MS-269-2, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035  510-651-7483  47164 Male Terrace, Fremont, CA  94539-7921  "

We had a disk crash several  months ago which required completely rebuilding the O/S files - same old  story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  As you can guess, I didn't  remember to re-disable VRFY and EXPN until I saw people on the net trying to  find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  When I saw people's names posted  here, I felt it was time to clear things up.  So, EXPN and VRFY on csrc have  always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with   Clipper.    I posted the White House announcements at the request of policy folks here  because csrc also provides Usenet service.  I posted them from an account  called 'clipper.'  I also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains  the addresses of members of the NIST Computer Security Privacy and Advisory  Board, set up under law of the Computer Security Act of 1987, and addresses  of other individuals not affiliated with NIST but involved in cryptography,  security, and privacy - I believe that these individuals were included on  this list because NIST felt it important to get them the Clipper information  first-hand.    The 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  It is   not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial  traffic.  Individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get  traffic that is not already duplicated on Usenet.    While you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,  I would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives  of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - I've already apologized to them  for what's happened.  Disabling EXPN and VRFY is an increasingly common  practice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again  was unintentional.    -John Wack     "

The fighting    The word ""troops"" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidence  that there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the village  apart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to the  Haganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot of  casualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they ran  into trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group   of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty.  Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of the  major inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.    Incidentally, ""three times as heavy"" may be correct, as there is  serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than  to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares  wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of  wounded Arabs.  Guess why.    >was thus very severe.

(Flames to /dev/null)    --------- Begin Enclosed Article -----------    			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT    			      by J. Neil Schulman    If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,  right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call  would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call  if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning  of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?    That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los  Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton  Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the  foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.  Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor  journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of  ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus.""    A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's  expertise.    Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades  before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at  USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the  professional aspects of journalism for ""Editor and Publisher"", a weekly  magazine focusing on the journalism field.    He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam  Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's  fifth book on usage, ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus,"" has been in  continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner  of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.    That sounds like an expert to me.    After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced  myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent  the following letter:    ""I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in  English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United  States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.    ""The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being  necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep  and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'    ""The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the  sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a  free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect  to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the  right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'    ""I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into  consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted  entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,  since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation  regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever  analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to  stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under  oath to support, if necessary.""    My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,  then concluded:    ""I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task  with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is  vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.  While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of  its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.""    After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for  his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our  opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political  subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have  inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):    [Copperud:] ""The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the  security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your  letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a  clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is  followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb  'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for  maintaining a militia.    ""In reply to your numbered questions:    [Schulman:] ""(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep  and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?""    [Copperud:] ""(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear  arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by  others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect  to a right of the people.""    [Schulman:] ""(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted  by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a  preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state  that such right 'shall not be infringed'?""    [Copperud:] ""(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence  is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be  preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.""    [Schulman:] ""(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms  conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact  necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not  existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,  shall not be infringed' null and void?""    [Copperud:] ""(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to  keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence  of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the  right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated  militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep  and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.""    [Schulman:] ""(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary  to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place  conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such  right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?""    [Copperud:] ""(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as  previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the  militia.""    [Schulman:] ""(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated  militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'  'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?""    [Copperud:] ""(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior  authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian  control over the military.""    [Schulman:] ""(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the  changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200  years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the  intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.""    [Copperud:] ""To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the  meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the  amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: ""Since a  well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the  right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'    [Schulman:] ""As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also  appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second  Amendment to the following sentence,    ""A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free  State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be  infringed.'    ""My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,    ""(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way  the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;  and    ""(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people  to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for  example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?""    [Copperud:] ""(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the  amendment in grammatical structure.    ""(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the  possibility of a restricted interpretation.""    Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his  cover letter: ""With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative  efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach  any conclusion.""    So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what  many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally  protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all  governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.    As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the  Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that  part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the  old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.    And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed  officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States  ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.  American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning  arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements  regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an  abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,  guaranteed by the Constitution.    And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the  rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.    it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to  preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our  elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding  them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who  decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but  means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?    Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution  of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend  that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as  a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush  was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook   remember.    Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply ""ask"" their  chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be ""nice""  boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the  chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.    Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the  same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know  this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and   Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show   trials.

Around here, long-guns are proof of age and fill out the forms.  For pistols, nation-wide check for felonies and three days wait.

Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck  with no permit, no license, and at age 12 if I'm engaged in farming  work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this.

Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from  practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract  a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost ""in a crowd of one""  than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of  the word ""intimidation"" and you can see where intimidation is not  the preferable method for the normal citizen.    >Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':  >We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide  >to take action we DO.  >Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....  >(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)

To  draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in  NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires  no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence  Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having  motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the  EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in  telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note  that our own state governments often play with game with the federal  government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.    >IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.  >But should it have to be like that ??    	It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to  remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we  have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the  police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals  in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.    >Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??  >If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think  >it should be free to buy guns ??

The first experiment in America, where property ownership was denied,  caused, starvation, hunger, and death.  Few people know that the  Pilgrims originally tried to have common property to grow food and a  common food store.  Many people know the hardships they suffered the  first few winters because of it.  After arriving, the Pilgrims made all  property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops  went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford  privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry  D. Westbrook:  ""The change was immediately justified by the increased  industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.""    Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  ""The  experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried  sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the  vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of  later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into  a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser  than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much  confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been  to their benefit and comfort.""    Bradford did not blame this failure on the ""strangers"", but on the basic  selfishness in all men.  He wrote ""seeing all men have this corruption in  them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.""  In other  words, according to Westbrook, ""Bradford found private enterprise to be  the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.""    Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private  property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings  starvation, poverty and discontent.  --   Paul Schmidt: Advocates for Self-Government, Davy Crockett Chapter President  706 Judith Drive, Johnson City, TN 37604, (615)283-0084, uunet!tijc02!pjs269  ""Freedom seems to have unleashed the  creative energies of the people -- and  leads to ever higher levels of income and social progress.""  --  U.N. report "

I lived in the west, and I have seen how     your media prepared you (helpless naive Americans) for a war against                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   No doubt you plan on exploiting ""helpless naive Americans"" for your own  purposes. Hmm...let's see:       Iraq even before the artificial conflict between Iraq and Kuwait that     led to the invasion, as the CIA correctly predicted (and pretended to     be surprised not to know).     It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.       What would I have done: Most Muslims would choose 300 dead Kuwaitis   over     200,000 dead Iraqis and 1000 dead Kuwaitis. The first case would happen     if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct     or indirect result of western envolvement.     Possibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based on  Greenpeace estimates.  Greenpeace had compromised its alleged  impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental  consequences of Allied miiltary action, while initially *completely*  ignoring Iraq's horrible environmental crimes, starting with the dumping  of millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf at Ahmadi to the blowing of  over 700 oil wells.  What is the real number?  There has been a lot of  work on this in the last two years, none of it reported as the  Greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about.  The real  number seems to be around 10,000, on the same order as the number of  Kuwaitis killed, tortured and kidnapped during the occupation.  I've  included an article I recently posted below, but this is really old  news.  Independent Television News reported a figure around 15,000 only  a few months after the war, but it was hardly reported.     For the Allies to have killed 200,000 Iraqis, they would have had to  kill twice the *total* number of Iraqis in Kuwait.     The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at  Mutla'.  This was yet another example of the American and European media  playing into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The  destruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-out  slaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy  was bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points.    Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled  on foot.     Furthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invaded  is completely ridiculous.  You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly)    that Saddam is a barbarous brute.  You have acknowledged the hundreds  of thousands he has been responible for killing *in his own country*.   You *know* that the man he appointed as governor of Kuwait,  Ali Majid,  was his most brutal henchman, presiding over the near genocide of the  Kurds  in the late 80's and, more recently, the Shi'a.    Yet, when it  comes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.  In your estimate,  he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started.   What a joke!       APn  03/09 0006  Iraq War Dead     Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.     By NICK LUDINGTON    Associated Press Writer      WASHINGTON (AP) -- After the Persian Gulf War ended, the world was  told that   as many as 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. At one point, even Baghdad put   the toll that high, as did the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in private.      But U.S. officials have been backpedaling ever since, even though the   Pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public.   Now, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed may  have been   as low as 1,500.      That conclusion by John Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the   quarterly magazine Foreign Policy, represents the lowest estimate yet  from U.S.   defense sources.      The revisions suggesting a less devastating Iraqi toll fit a pattern of   vastly moderated U.S. military claims in the months after the war ended.  Claims   for a number of U.S. weapons also were scaled down.      Despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking   pictures of Iraq's disastrous retreat from Kuwait, arguments have continued   unabated about what really happened in the Gulf War.      Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that   originally were aired. More that a year ago, Air Force Lt. Gen. Charles  Horner,   the commander of the air campaign in the Gulf War, said he believed the Iraqi   military death toll was fewer than 10,000 for the entire war.      The Pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of   Iraqis who died in the 42-day war against the U.S.-led coalition in  January and   February 1991. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Joe Gradisher  reiterated   past statements that ""there just isn't a number,"" that is credible.      But some current internal estimates range from 8,000 to 25,000 Iraqi troops   killed, said one analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, who is familiar   with the Pentagon's reports.      Allied deaths were put at 146 Americans, 35 by friendly fire; 24 British, 9   by American fire; 2 Frenchmen, 1 Italian and 39 among various Arab allies.      Of the postwar reassessments, the most widely publicized was the Army's   reluctant acknowledgement, months later, that its touted Patriot air defense   system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against Iraq's Scud missiles.   The Bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the   Patriot; last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent.      The success record of the Navy's Tomahawk high-tech cruise missile used   against targets in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq also turned out to be more   modest than initially indicated by the Pentagon.      The first Iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a  May 1991   report by the environmental group Greenpeace, which said 100,000 to 120,000   Iraqi soldiers were killed. It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians   were also killed.      The same month, published reports said the Defense Intelligence Agency   estimated 100,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded in the  air and   ground campaigns -- although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate   could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction.      But as more information became available, those figures gradually were   revised downward.      The House Armed Services Committee staff estimated 9,000 dead and 17,000   wounded after a review last year.      But Heidenrich, writing in the current issue of the quarterly Foreign  Policy,   estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives  as low as   1,500 -- with about 3,000 wounded.      Heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of  bodies found   and buried by U.S. troops -- 577 -- and on prisoner of war interviews.  He noted   that only about 2,000 of 69,000 Iraqi prisoners of war were wounded.      Based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were   captured, he put the number of wounded at about 3,000. Using a conservative   ratio of one dead to two wounded, applicable to Third World armies like  Iraq, he   set battlefield deaths at 1,500.      ""Maybe the figures are too low,"" he wrote. ""Maybe the real death toll  on the   battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000. Even then, the evidence  suggests a   death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000.""      In an interview, he said the 100,000 figure was obviously off base  because it   would mean that virtually all the Iraqi soldiers in the Kuwait theater of   operations were casualties.      He said today's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology,   but rather the drawn-out conflicts such as those in Yugoslavia and Somalia.           "

They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council  summit saying Iran   had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding  measures that ""rocked   Gulf stability and security.""       The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements  by Egypt, which   engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia  and Qatar that   allowed all members to attend the summit.       Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and  Tehran's alleged   encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind  President Hosni   Mubarak's mediation.       The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the  Gulf Arab states and   Iran ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take  in line with its   commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of  the sovreignty and   territorial integrity of the region's states.""       It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it  shares with the   United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and  Lesser Tumbs   islands.       Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a  small garrison it   established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.       It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the  island for the   UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority  over the whole   island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation.       The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the  UAE has since the   Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part  of a general   settlement.       The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against  Iraq for not fully   implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of  Kuwait.       They endorsed once again the ""Damascus Declaration,"" a pact signed  with Egypt and   Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove  Iraqi troops out of   Kuwait.       But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a  fund they   announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year  which would have   helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme.       They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of  contributions from each state   although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the  $10 billion agreed   last year.       The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,  Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and   Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although  their unity was only   maintained with outside help.       Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow  progress of the   conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the  region that boasts   the bulk of global oil and gas reserves.       The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals.       One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos  to create a   100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member  against external   aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.       Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man  ""Peninsula   Shield"" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is  commanded by a Saudi   general.       Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market  although the summit   called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due  to be held in   Saudi Arabia next December.    REUTER YA DYA DJG         RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT         ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day  annual summit on   Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three  strategic Gulf islands as   a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf.       A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the  settlement of a   row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for  continued U.N. sanctions   against Iraq.       It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council  decisions following the   expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year.       The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common  market, but called on   officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six  members to the next   summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993.       The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf  Arab states and Iran   ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in  line with its   commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of  the sovreignty and   territorial integrity of the region's states.""       It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it  shares with the   United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller  islands, the Greater and   Lesser Tumbs.       It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified  Iranian measures   which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on  Iran to rescind   those measures and end the occupation which it said was ""shaking peace  and stability in   the area.""       Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a  small garrison it   established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah.       It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the  island for the   UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces  continue to   exercise their authority over the whole island.

REUTER YA DYA DJG       RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS      (Eds: updates with SNSC statement)       NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on  Saturday it was ready   to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its  eight-year war with   Iraq.       ""Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to  the world that   our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and  safeguard the   territorial integrity of Iran,"" Iran's Supreme National Security Council  (SNSC) said.       A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council  voiced full support   on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran  over the Gulf   islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb.       The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.  Besides the UAE, the GCC   also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.       Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's  meeting on   Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:  ""Iran is surely   stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross  a sea of blood.""       The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received  in Cyprus, also   criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as ""irresponsible.""      ""No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,""  said the SNSC.       Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to  be close to the   Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's  self-restraint had certain   limits.       It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971  agreement to   share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied.       ""The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain  from responding to   the blows inflicted by them was ""childish,"" Tehran Times said.       IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which  urged Iran to   reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull  out of the two other   islands.       Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have  historically belonged to it.   The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.    REUTER AF JCH     RTw  12/28 1011  TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN         TEHRAN, Dec 28, Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers, angered by Gulf  Arab claims to   three disputed islands, are hitting back with demands that Tehran revive  its claim to   Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq.       President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials strongly  condemned a statement   last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) backing the  United Arab   Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands.       But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran go  further than   restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of Abu  Musa, Greater Tumb   and Lesser Tumb.       ""It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined the  others,"" Jomhuri Eslami   said. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.       ""If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh of  Bahrain should go about   his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, which  belonged to Iran until   1970, should be re-established,"" the paper said.       ""It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of  Iran's sovereignty   over Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the  separation of Bahrain   from Iran,"" it added.       The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970,  a year before the   island became an independent state.       Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully  avoided raising the   Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during  periods of   tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf.       Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of  appeasing pro-Western   Gulf Arab rulers had backfired.       ""No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of  the Persian Gulf, it   is the United States and the West which speak the last word,"" it said.       ""They (the sheikhs) are nobody,"" Salam said, adding that Iran should  revise its policy   towards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq.       ""Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with  Iraq...and going along with   some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role  in the formation of   the current situation,"" the paper said.       Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988,  improved briefly   after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.       But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the  ensuing war,   again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed  a Shi'ite Moslem   revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait.

I can't help but wonder what would happen if all  violence against Israelis stopped.  Hopefully, violence against Arabs  would stop at the same time.  If a state of non-violence could be   maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,  greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the  ""territories"".      Of course, given the current leadership of Israel, your way may work  also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with Ariel  Sharon's mentality, then I would predict a considerable loss of life,  i.e., no winners.    Secondly, regarding your comment about the U.S. troops responding  to ""stiff resistance"" - the analogy is not quite valid.  The U.S.  troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  The Israelis  could not.    Just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.    Respectfully,         Ben. "

Don Alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to  comp.risks.  I'll present my variant on it instead, since I feel it's a  bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat.  depends on the  protocol that's followed for reading traffic.  Briefly, the cops get a  wiretap warrant, and record the call.  They then notice the encryption  and the disclosure header.  It, along with a copy of their warrant, is  sent to the FBI, or whoever it is who holds the family key.  The  F-holder decrypts the header, and sends the serial number N and the  encrypted session key U[K] to the escrow agents.  They, in turn, use U1  and U2 to recover K, and send that to the local police.    Note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever.  Neither the  cops nor the FBI ever see U, so they can't read other traffic.  Every  request must be validated by both the FBI and the escrow agents.  The  cops and the FBI together can't cheat, since they don't have U.  (I  regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the  system.  It's to prevent this that I modified Alvarez's scheme.)  The  escrow agents can't read the conversation, since they don't have it;  all they have is N and U[K].  And the police don't even see N.    It's harder to see how to block decryption of old, warrantless,  wiretaps.  There is one protection -- you have to persuade the escrow  agents that the call is current.  But that's not nearly as strong.  There are approaches I can see that might work, involving sequences of  data on an unalterable medium, complete with cryptographic protection  against insertion onto a new medium.  But I don't have anything yet  that isn't too complex for comfort, or too hard to install in the real  world.  The NSA might have an answer; they may or may not be smarter  than me, but I've been working on this for a week, and they've had years. "

It is Armenian  soldiers from mainland Armenia that are shelling towns in Azarbaijan.  You might wish to read more about whether or not it is Azeri aggression  only in that region.

As a self-proclaimed atheist, I believe that *some* conceptions  of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and I lack  belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no  reason for me to believe in these.  I usually use the word  agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of  a god is unknown inherently unknowable.

I speculate, from the MykoTronx data sheet on the MYK-78, that the algorithm   is a classified cryptosystem, similar in application to DES but cleared by   the NSA for classified traffic, that has been in use for a number of years.    Myktotronx refers to it as ""Government Type II encryption"", which matches the   designation of one of the types of encryption available on STU-III phones,   and may be the same as a cryptosystem I have heard called ""CIPHER2"".    This would make sense, since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem   which can act as a ""pin-compatible"" substitute for DES.  Combined with a   tappable key exchange protocol, this would offer exactly what is claimed for   Clipper: secure encryption with access via a key escrow.  If this is fact the   case, it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself.    Now, I do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem; my knowledge   of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy :), it's nonexistent.  However,   it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the   government: take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of DES   (and which is at least as secure), set up a key escrow scheme for law   enforcement, and promote it for public use.  This also fits with Mykotronx,   who's been around but almost invisible for years.    Has anyone else made this sort of connection, or am I just hallucinating pink   elephants here? :).

If you  want to know about events in Palestine it makes more sense to get the news  directly from the source. EVERY news source is inherently biased to some  extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. However,   the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the ""truth"" and to discern   the bias.     Go read or listen to some Israeli media.

The thought of this, if the  administration realised, would probably scare them shitless.    Now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol  for internet speech *damn fast*, allowing anyone who feels brave to  inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our  workstations.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  The CELP stuff is standardised,  we use tcp/ip streams, and a protocol allowing silences to be used to  catch up on any net lag, and also to avoid sending any data during  silences (ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end  because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags)    As for me, I'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as  I get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander          of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,          Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)    ""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the   liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the   allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of   the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian   was permitted to approach the city and its environs.     While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained   in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the   area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to    attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the   plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder   of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by   the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers   who had remained in the rear during the war.     One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of   soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of   seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,   and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud   and dirt...     It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and   traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds   and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night   patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The    Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear   also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the   trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for   fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder   and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.     Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir   Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander   in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.   The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals   that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its   highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half   of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.     ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,   Odishelidge. They were as follows:     The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the   act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...   More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been   killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless    Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the   murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood    near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:   'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten   more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when   the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.     The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently   fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.   Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw   towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew   to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and   destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.     During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages   that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the    Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers   were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time   when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill   the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries   of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the    Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would   have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from   acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with   hatred and loathing.     Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that   he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The   Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the   stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since   the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed   in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen   of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping   him with the iron heel of his boot.     Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape   from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off   by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered   children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village   of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:     There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.   Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and   spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about   25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140    centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,   children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of   rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.     A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators   for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov   to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be    proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's   disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,   instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely   reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told   the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more   licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent   and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity   and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,   the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and   claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.     An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command   narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:     The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut   out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.   The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men    of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they   took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people   among this group were able to save their lives as the result of   my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were    released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.    Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the   Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered   on the streets.     On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent   Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were   threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for   murdering an innocent Turk.      When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would    be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare   you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the    Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard   that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within   the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same    day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to   him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible   act. However no result was achieved.     In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a   natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived   the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the    Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had   been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.    The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed   one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached   three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details   of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers   were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even   withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred   people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading   Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.   However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with   the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower   classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders   of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.      I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals   were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who   opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that   it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.   Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian   cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have   supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred   to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by   the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.   You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a   conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear   of the Turkish soldiers.     The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real   nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can   be undone.""    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                    (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                             'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                               a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)   "

Matthew      Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on      Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material      posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).    US PLANETARY MISSIONS          MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)        MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed      minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground      stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the      onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in      the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the      Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed      to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a      transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted      from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative      of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations      of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.        MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December      of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a      very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world      with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide      (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).        MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective      shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary      space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar      panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in      solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.        MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and      took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it      flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere      much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from      this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the      geological and biological sense.        MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that      planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information      that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times      that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface      of an ocean.        MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work      done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away      the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic      measurements of MARINER 4.        MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket      launcher autopilot failed.        MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to      orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no      other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian      surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once      flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup      images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.        MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe      did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in      ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,      plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four      Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974      to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed      Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than      thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which      makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.          PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)        PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph      the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide      new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new      data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft      had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on      October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.        PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first      U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally      designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead      studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to      36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6      through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,      and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would      have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.        PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER      11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to      study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through      1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever      to do so.        PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER      12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made      the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus      2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere      in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the      atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the      surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day      probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before      its batteries failed.          RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)        RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They      were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems      left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.        RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an      instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the      launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.      RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the      camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.        RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but      suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,      the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.        RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost      all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon      and drifted off into solar orbit.        RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send      back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact      with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras      did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first      U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.          LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)        LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image      various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO      missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our      understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.      All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were      essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.      probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar      surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.          SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)        The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar      module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the      soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered      in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing      vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was      strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.        Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the      first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images      and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from      SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,      the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored      the Tycho crater region in 1968.          VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)        VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on      a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June      19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse      Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for      Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes      found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of      its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was      pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is      pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the      thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and      boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.        The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran      out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a      weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep      functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command      had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until      further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the      engineers' efforts through May of 1983.        An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the      Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the      lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,      D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until      it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.        VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit      on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in      Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its      sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording      one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in      1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut      down on April 12, 1980.        The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.          VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)        VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March      5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched      August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,      1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and      by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare      once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to      outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,      but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.        Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their      satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered      that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and      aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major      surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous      volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.        When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets      and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep      the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive      jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle      is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was      startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.      The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,      kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.        VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,      continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly      monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was      found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational      axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on      Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10      satellites and one more ring were discovered.        In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,      including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright      patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were      discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a      canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)        The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their      on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets      beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the      location of the heliopause.      SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS        Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and      Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:          SOVIET LUNAR PROBES        LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first  	     craft in solar orbit.      LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.      LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.      ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was  	     also a test for future Mars missions.      LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images  	     from surface.      LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.      LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.      ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8  	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were  	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.      LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil  	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in  	      1972.      LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's  	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished  	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.      LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in  	      1976.          SOVIET VENUS PROBES        VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions  	       lost enroute in 1961.      VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with  	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in  	       February of 1966. No images were returned.      VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.  	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe  	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.      VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending  	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before  	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles  	       similar in 1969.      VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet  	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in  	       1972.      VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the  	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar  	       mission.      VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.  		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.      VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of  		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.      VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian  	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on  	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in  	     March of 1986.          SOVIET MARS PROBES        MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased  	     enroute the following year.      ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian  	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.      MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian  	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red  	     Planet in 1971.      MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander  	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.      MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to  	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.      MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in  	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.  	     probe MARINER 9.      MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.      MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit  	     with its flyby bus.      PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest  	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to  	       human/computer error.      PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did  	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week  	       before scheduled Phobos landing.        While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even      interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have      yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,      Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a      Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been      planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now      the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their      space program remains to be seen.      JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS        SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on      January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km      on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to      measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of      which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on      January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest      approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The      geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for      a Japanese spacecraft.        During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail      passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby      will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third      October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).          HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,      1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten      once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first      lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget      satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to      orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.        The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An      apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists      to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March      19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The      rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt      camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.        Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and      performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten      made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,      1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and      fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into      lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the      approach:    	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km  	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km  	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)  	Period		: 4.7 days      PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES        I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three      groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,      and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means      complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your      research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can      add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.        Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it      would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in      order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in      this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date      general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra      background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good      public and university library. Some of the more recently published works      can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market      bookstore.

Other works and periodicals:        NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space      probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry      these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission      you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study      some of the books listed above.        Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL      GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's      Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,      SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER      missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the      VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.        More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions      can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and      SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major      newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,      but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events      were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are      affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you      probably know.        Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you      might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space      groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their      periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe      missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,      Pasadena, California 91106 USA.        Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I      personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas      in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from      it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

You even make Armenians laugh.    ""An appropriate analogy with the Jewish Holocaust might be the   systematic extermination of the entire Muslim population of    the independent republic of Armenia which consisted of at    least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. The    memoirs of an Armenian army officer who participated in and    eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the U.S. in   1926 with the title 'Men Are Like That.'

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the   area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population   of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were   Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.   Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third   of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the    Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan   uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians   as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,   however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the   guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000   inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character    notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian    Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the    southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts    into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable    and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets    completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They    found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border    into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole    length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to    Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain    plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of    Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for    howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the    scattered bones of the dead.""

2,"      ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56    (Flight V.56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS-601 series   Galaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)    The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE   satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with   inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km.  This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L   configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched  from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French   Guiana.    The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg  of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass  at liftoff is 361,778 kg.      Required Orbit Characteristics:    Perigee Altitude ..... 200 km    Apogee Altitude ...... 36,160 km at injection     Inclination ..........   5 degrees      The Ariane 42L lift-off for Flight 56 is scheduled on Thursday,  April 29, 1993, as soon as possible within the following launch   window:         Kourou Time        GMT (04/30/93)      Washington, DC       21:52 - 22:50      00:52 - 01:50       20:52 - 21:50      LAUNCH VEHICLE:    Ariane 42L.  This is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid   fueled strap-on boosters.  The first stage (L220) is built by Aerospatiale,  and is powered by 4 liquid fueled Viking V engines.  The second stage (L33)  is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the  Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages  use a biliquid UH25/N2O4 fuel. The third stage (H10) is built by Aerospatiale,  and is powered by a cryogenic H2/O2 fueled HM-7B engine built by SEP. The two  strap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built   by SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.    The fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad.    It uses the Type 01 Ariane Short payload fairing.

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces  on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps,  the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams'  ""Reference Data for Engineers,"" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims  in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...        width   Temp rise      inches  degrees C      ------  ---------       .125	100       .15	 75       .17	 60       .20	 45       .24	 30       .33	 20    At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.  Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes  up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be   ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the   required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself,   I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is  a transient or fault condition.)    (There's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough?  But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or  just the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separate  sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.) "

Only guessing, but from his address I'd say that Jerry, like          me, lives in Canada. Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in          the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen          the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.            We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and          ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the          objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's          everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any          time they actually go after somebody just because they don't          like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often          blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed          Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme          Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to          Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).            Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of          it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we          have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the          War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional          powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more          arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the          War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop          fighting each other long enough to do any really effective          suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our          Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend          off a bent cop.            It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and          the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order,          while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government          is getting in-your-face liberty.            That's not to say our time won't come. It looks like Chretien          is going to run on a law-and-order platform. Be afraid.

Sounds like it  would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly  low orbit.    	2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?  What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical  astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?    	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of  'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the  sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large  inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?  The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is  being used to help fund this thing.    	4) If your answer to 3) above was ""the astronomers"", then feel  free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more  important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING  ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

Getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on  a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be  retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the  data.    The right way to do communications security is to generate a random  session key with Diffie Hellman, use it for a while and then destroy  it. Once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt  recordings of the conversation.    To make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you  have to authenticate your DH exchanges. The AT&T secure phone does  this by displaying the DH key so you can compare them verbally over  the phone. This is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness  plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'  voices.    A better way is to authenticate the exchanges with RSA. Since you'd  never use RSA for actual encryption, compromising your RSA secret key  would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation,  and even that only until you revoke your public key.  They would still  not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the  session keys have been destroyed.    I'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones  (the STU-III) must work. Neat, eh?    Phil     "

Saying ""hopefully the effect of policy X will be Y"" is *much* different  from saying ""hopefully if there is any effect of policy X it will be Y.""  Here you've made both statements.

According to groups like the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence (formerly  the National Coalition to Ban Handguns - interesting name change, don't you  think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the ""leading causes of  unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other  means as causes of unintentional death.

Certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the  anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by  firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use  these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I'm  sorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning  accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,  but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun  control measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.  The fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may  be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.    >>Please explain why you think ""symbolic offerings"" do good.  >>  > My point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police  >departments MIGHT (I stress might) do a LITTLE (I stress little) good by  >giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond  >to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.

I thought you were waffling on your view  of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully  preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on  all these counts; I can't understand how a buying guns from people who  aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to  commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a  positive way for police to respond to ""interpersonal violence.""    >>I suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these ""statistics"" - I  >>suspect you'll find if you look carefully that 135,000 is the number of  >>students *estimated* to have carried *a weapon* (not necessarily a gun)  >>to school at least once in the past year, and not the number of students  >>who carry a gun to school daily.  >>  > Well Joe, I suggest that you talk to the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence    What, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit  suicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL  METHODS per year?

The  agency that funded the ""study"" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban  had saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of  a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?

What's this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary  school I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a  problem?  I didn't touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also  been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the  car, the knives, the oven, and the tools.

From a pragmatic standpoint, there certainly is some justification  if it is a vice people will commit anyway. Shall we criminalize  alcohol again? If the re-legalization for alcohol were done from  anything other than the pragmatic standpoint, I'd be happy to hear   about it.

Only the first one make any sense. There is nothing to ""legalize""  about all the rest. Just in case you haven't made the connection   (which I expect you haven't) the connecting theme in this thread is  a persons autonomy over their life and body. Vice statutes serve  only to make it more expensive for the rich and more dangerous  for the poor, as Tim so eloquently put it. People will, however,  take autonomy over their lives, regardless of what the government  says.    And why, pray tell, is AIDS ""victim"" in snear quotes?

Are we going to ""make do without"" like the people in New York City?   You know New York City: That gun ban utopia you dream about, with  the millions of unregistered handguns?  New York City, by the way,  has a very high crime rate.    Perhaps you should know about a gungrabber's nightmare - Idaho.  Here in Idaho, the police give concealed carry permits to anyone  over 21 without a criminal record.  There are no gungrabber schemes  such as FOIDs, waiting periods, ""gun a month,"" or LTCs.  And horror  of horrors!  You don't even NEED a permit to carry a concealed  weapon while outside of city limits (although you do need a permit  for concealed carry in an automobile).

This time, fascist x-Soviet Armenian   Government will not get away with the genocide of 204,000 Azeri men, women   and children.

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH    ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO   INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...    As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw   the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as   they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to   journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts   of the hills.    The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING   of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians   last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death   or missing...     Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter   as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there   was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer   ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We   swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon   under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.    We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round   again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a   valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung   round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired   repeated blasts.    Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting   had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed   enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in   fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.   I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,   its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on   ""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a   search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.    Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two   M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed   flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second   crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains   and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters   were there to give covering fire if necessary.    The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet   armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani   official told us that there were now five former Soviet military   helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have   signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged   in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian   pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.    We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an   heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer   white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four   corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an   Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies   on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back   towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before   the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.    Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the   civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were   covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor   mortis. They had been shot.    What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,   and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY   DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

But did it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,   the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated   in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion  and national origin? By the way, you still haven't corrected yourself.  During World War II Armenians were carried away with the German might and  cringing and fawning over the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication  in Germany, Hairenik, carried statements as follows:[1]    ""Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)   when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it    becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon   method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical   operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing.""     Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -  extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San  Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published  in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.     ""...We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities    against our people (Jews)...Members of our family witnessed the     murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian     neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish     and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see     the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors...    Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise     to grant them self government if, in return, the Armenians would     help exterminate Jews...Armenians were also hearty proponents of    the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists.

Well, I had had similar reactions many times.  That was when I really  started WATCHING CAREFULLY - reaction to Doritos - hey guess what's in  there - reaction to Lawry's season salt - guess what's in THERE    I'll give you a hint - I've had enough problems with MANY MANY MANY  different products with MSG that I figured out one thing.    UNLESS I plan on getting sick - I won't eat the stuff without my  Seldane.  And did I ever learn to read labels.    > PLEASE note that I am NOT saying you are making it up, I am just  > trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it  > might seem.      Which was why I started checking EVERY time I got sick.  And EVERY  time I got sick MSG was somehow involved in one of the food products.  And consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)  - it might not please a medical researcher - but it pleased my own  personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and MOST  IMPORTANTLY it's enough proof for ME to avoid it (and enough proof  that my INCREDIBLY frugal fiance didn't flinch when I literally threw  out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg -  and he always flinches when there's waste - but it was a simple  explanation - I won't eat this stuff, I WON'T cook with this stuff, so  I can either throw it out or give it away.)    > From: pattee@ucsu.Colorado.EDU (Donna Pattee)    > My guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained MSG,     Probably Lawry's seasoning salt.  I LOVE the way that tastes.      I'm not saying I NEVER consume ANYTHING with MSG.  I've noticed that I  have a certain tolerance level - like a (small) bag of bbq chips once  a month or so it not a problem - but that same bag of chips will  bother me if I also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of  the Chinese restaurants the day before.      > From: kelley@healthy.uwaterloo.ca (Catherine L.

But - some say that only 2% of the population has a problem with MSG -  some say it's more like 20% - but let's say that it's 5%.  How many  people would have to be tested that would have a problem?  Also - I  KNOW I have a problem with it, and I wouldn't VOLUNTEER for a test.  Like thanks guys but I don't WANT to get sick.  Also - I'm sure that  most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at  different times.  If I have a cold I'm MUCH more susceptible to the  reaction than when I'm healthy (as proven today - when I'm stuffy but  for some silly reason I still gave in and decided to have the BBQ  chips ;}).    > From: kiran@village.com (Kiran Wagle)    > Because too many of you (generic rhetorical 'you,' not 'you Cathy') go  > around calling this ""Chinese restaurant syndrome,"" thus suggesting to the  > people you complain to that you experience this ONLY from Chinese food.   > MSG is prevalent in a LOT more things than Chinese food--thats why I  > suggested calling this ""Diner syndrome.""

2,"  I love the FAQ.           The comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining  correction after RK and possibly after PRK is interresting.  Why is  this?  Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?    Also, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of  only about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to  95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar  with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not  be understanding all of the differences.    In the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than  with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the  intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when  necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It  is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other  consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  The  first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which  glasses couldn't help.     would not help.    --   | Daniel R.

I have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2-3 top schools a bunch of middles  and a few ""safety""  (funny that most of my safety schools were the first  to reject me)    my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were R7 P9 B10 WQ and R7 P9 B11 WR  I couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art  history, politics etc     Ive done medical research at the undergrad level, done clinical lab work  for years now, but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.    I cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. What  percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average?  I felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm  acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the  mailbox anxiety?      If you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments  for me feel free to send them down... Typing is a form of anti-anxiety  thereapy hehehehe :)      --            /\ _ /\          |            Felix The Cat          |  0 0  |-------\==     The Wonderful, Wonderful Cat!                            \==@==/\  ____\ |     ===============================   Meow!--- \_-_/  ||     ||            hoss@panix.com "

Trying to make comparisons between Israels politics and Nazi German-    Austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance (high), intellect    (low), humanity (none) and antisemitism (average). I respect anybody    who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a    civilized manner. I would never say that anybody that critizises Israel    and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic    vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. Israel is not a perfect country and    its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt    (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:    to care for the safety of ALL its citizens, and that is really not an    easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect    that Israel commits the ONE BIG ERROR and wipe the country (and its    Jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to    live in peace with their Jewish neighbours) of the map. As I said,    Israel is not a perfect country, but it is the ONLY democracy in the    whole Middle-East and the only country in the world where Jews from    everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries    they are living.    Our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-Jewish    nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big    social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones    that pay for the broken glasses are the Jews, and later the other    minorities of the country.      > I don't think the suffering of some Jews during WWII                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   > justifies the crimes commited by the Israeli government.

This is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered Jews, besides the    thousands  who survived the Shoa in some way or another, and the rest    of the living ones mourning for all of them ! I don't know what you    call a ""Civil Libertarian"" (never heard about them) but I know only    one thing: if all of them think like you do it, then ""Civil Libertarians""    is a new denomination for Antisemites.

That's  why they're used.      Actually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a ""sugar pill"".  I don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always  labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the  name.

1,"  First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and  erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.  Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of  the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the  writings of the era. This  is most refreshing.    Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.  My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend  to several matters pertaining to the State Militia.    Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-  nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss  would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both  organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,  Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar  to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks  of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary  but are probably similar.    Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as ""all able-bodied  citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-  two (62) years..."". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National  Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The  National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.  It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion  of this ""para-constitutional"" arrangement is quite interesting in itself  but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this  date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing  as anything but a Federal reserve force.    Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized  Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other   States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as  a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and  senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill  on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once  a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our  State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an  organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will  come from the unorganized Militia.    In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order  the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will  first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either  its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the  event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law  provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the  unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by  law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia  of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State  does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such  a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use  of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen.     It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being  the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.    >No, I simple stated that the people have a right to ""join a well  >organized militia.""  And I have also stated that a militia that  >meets once or twice a year is clearly ""well organized.""  And this  >state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a ""right""  >to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated  >by Hamilton.     Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole  representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have  chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist  end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can  be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that  the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia  or ""train bands"" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-  ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to  provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,  and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,  ""terrible and irresistible"".    These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation  of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress  Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear  Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.  These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-  ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.    The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the   Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting  wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The  Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by  the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the  War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States  territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional  authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal  Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until  WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.  When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new  member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were  ""grandfathered"". At least one of these ""grandfathered"" individuals  refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the  Federal Courts.    Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to  members of a ""well organized"" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional  history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when  The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's  definition of ""well organized"". In the period of peace between the  French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped  drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.  Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors  who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because  their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not  be so bold.    Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is  not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton  nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government  and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing  of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their  responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the  Constitution.     Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one  error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The  Constitution prohibits States from keeping ""Troops or Ships of War  in time of Peace"". I have heard some insist this prevents States from  maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not  understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.  Today we call any large vessel a ""ship"" but in the 18th century the word  described a particular kind of vessel.  A ""ship"" is a large vessel with  three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A ""brig"" has two  masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping  the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's  equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.  ""Troops"" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.  Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out.     In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being  personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia  as a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently  both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on  their place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or  scarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.  --   Donald R.

When I asked, people said that the  >interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more  >complicated.    You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not  interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal  you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an  all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's  heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks  that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the  properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at  that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not  unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things  in realtime if you write efficient code.    In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response)  filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out  there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with  resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as  the most cost effective method for volume production runs.      >Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the ""effective""  >sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency  >antialiasing filters.

Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that  they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to  filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and  give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they  charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.    I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are  built to a price spec, and that spec says ""cheap as possible!"".       >					---Joel Kolstad      -dave  --   Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                          37N 17.382    121W 59.190  "

Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of  the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes  the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive  is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug.  This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs  at home!!!!    >....procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss  >it with an independent doc.

I fully agree.  In addition, she proably should be examined by another  doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.  I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during  a lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have  the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician  is unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone   book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology,   or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.  By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune  with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help. "

As    the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face    up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what    was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted,    as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

""The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -    Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled   so long and furiously I'd never heard.

""At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole   high region called the Karabakh.

""The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,"" Merrimanov  said, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.  ""That is for morale,"" Dro put in. ""We must keep the Moslems in terror.""

Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;   then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the   spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though    I heard our Utica brass roar.     As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing   of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,   dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow   puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.   The came a shrill wailing.     Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about   house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in   clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen   were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.     'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape   over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked   breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by   afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and   the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.     At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward   Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and    tough, through dense scrub.

Between    the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun    dress.     The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He    lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the    pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed    just below his neck, into the spine.

Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction  of the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to  the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the  acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this  case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.      The record for acceleration, though, is measured along ""the direction  you're facing"" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record  was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.    Eric Seale  seale@pogo.den.mmc.com "
0,"     As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington  Times article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company  is Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end  of this message on how to contact them).       Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that  we are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications  brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.       His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the  rest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:     - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use     the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.     - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone     devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.     This stuck them as strange, until now...         Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several  concerns over the new Clipper Chip:      - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.      - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto      system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency      of the government.      - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm      is vulnerable over time to an attacker.      - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that      it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or      changing the keys themselves.      - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and      money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed      engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very      difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique      to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is      hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.    Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell  me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.  However he told me a little:     - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been     granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is     secure.     - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.     The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret     until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate     the following:        - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but        Mr. Melnick stated ""Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out."")        - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.        - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).        - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that        it is _adujustable_ and is ""More than adequate for security.""        - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and        can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which        is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I        consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.        - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques        such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the        hardware chip.        - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars        for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced        enough, which probably won't happen]).        - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm        and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted        data into ""blocks."" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know        what the block header is. This program operates at all supported        RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.        - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!        Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out  of business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in  stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact  them, they can be reached at..

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean  an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla  coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for  diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called  ""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly  efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,  which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active  reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve  efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core  resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI  for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer  screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil  from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all  Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter  and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind  to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,  gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and  telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????    GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE  TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!    If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.  (flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).    ----   ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that  David Koresh had ""explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40  feet into the air.""  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of  opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the  first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas  into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a  fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because  it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't  they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or  similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been  saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.    Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some  time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that  this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I  don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this  so-called ""explosion"" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.  We figure that this is what it was because of how the ""explosion""  looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,  dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion  in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something  that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.    Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four  officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that  some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown  by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about  whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they  said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE  THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?  Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the  cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.    What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the  compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade  body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on  the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a  spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this  grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only  people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be  a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,  or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their  face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the  rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the  ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to  make sure that others ""find"" what they want for them to ""find"" if  you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here  but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks  had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.  Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents  used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

2,"Nntp-Posting-Host: guitar.ucr.edu    There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's  LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to  stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by  saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense  of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station  miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" -  the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the  romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of  matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with  its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things  people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I  think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of  nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind  children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but  I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about  what we can do *now*.       Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...      SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW    Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)    At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a  midlife crisis.    The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no  longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion  -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic  rewards.      Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science  and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a  meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our  technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion  policy.      To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies  for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes  would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of  scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.    .....    Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to  write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively  supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion  to build space station Freedom alone.    Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,  Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken  public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much  of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope  to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively  implemented did not seem to matter much.    Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent  vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar  space budgets.    Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo  era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration  with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.      ......    While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel  Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being  positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's  technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been  slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions  its competitiveness agenda.    ......    ""I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen  now,"" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's Jet  Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.  ""We've put off a lot of things we shouldn't  have.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a  $40-billion one filled with white elephants."" "

1,"NNTP-Posting-Host: im4u.cs.utexas.edu    ...His account that is.    Many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here  on the net on a daily basis.  I have just been informed of what I feel is  one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- The   out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people  don't like what he says or thinks.    We have all seen the postings here by AJ Teel.  Although many of us have  not agreed with their content, I'm sure most of us have been at least  somewhat interested in them.  I, for one, am greatful to live (I thought)  in a country where people like Mr. Teel are allowed to say what they please.  If I don't wan't to read it, I can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  But,  unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  They feel  an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  Now it seems that  Mr. Teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif  net police, Ted Frank.      PLEASE HELP AJ TEEL REGAIN NET (POST) ACCESS AND CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE.                           ARE YOU ON TED'S HIT LIST?                          ARE YOUR THOUGHTS CORRECT?                            IS YOUR ACCOUNT SAFE?           HAS YOUR SYSADMIN BEEN CONTACTED BY THE THOUGHT POLICE?    I thought the NLG and the ACLU supported people with diverse opinions. NOT!       Please read the following forwarded messages from AJ Teel so that   you may understand this vial act for what it is...    ------------------------------ forwarded ---------------------------------    Newsgroups: alt.activism,alt.conspiracy,talk.politics.misc,misc.legal  Subject: Officer Ted Frank, Thought Police Badge Number NWO-666  Summary: Ted wins the argument by killing his opponent!  Expires:   Sender: ""A. J. Teel, Sui Juris"" (ajteel@dendrite.cs.Colorado.EDU)  Followup-To: alt.conspiracy  Distribution:   Organization: University of Colorado, Boulder  Keywords: NWO Ted Frank    Well, well, well... Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and  thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.  I guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult  for them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my  sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his  defense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has  been posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed  at me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding  via netmail...)    While I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin  to get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post  I made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not  what the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I  AM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him  axed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. ""Argumentum  ad silence-your-opponent-um""?! I would have thought he would have  wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and  seem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).    The issue that seems to be: ""Is the following an advertisement?""  Apparently, Ted and Mark think so...    1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken   	*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article  	constitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post  	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one  	had posted the address and subscription price of ""Newsweek"",  	would that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.  2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of  	""proof"" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains  	to my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and  	behold, ""poof"", there goes my account. This one had an  	address in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!    If you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE  ITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send  a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get  ""Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..."" or whatever; they  only get ""I don't like what that user is doing because..."".  Please do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them  in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.    In my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying ""Thanks for  the info"" or ""Could you send me such and such?"" or ""Your posts are  very interesting... keep it up."" and only a handfull of ""Go aways"". But,  I guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to  convince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant  a message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...""My name is Ted and  and this is Mark... We're from the thought police. Seems you have  some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them..."")  NWO Indeed!    Guess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with  a new plan... Thanks Ted and Mike. Hope you are happy.  I will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!  Your comments and support are requested. I can no longer post  to news. I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit  from making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book.   Seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side  shut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the  process of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that  a lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.  Oh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I  was just getting started.    It should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40  times of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the  contrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank's motivations for getting me axed?  We all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people  on the net that are of ""interest"" to the government, and Ted sure seems  to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does  he work for? The University of Chicago which he ""attends""(?) is well  known as one of the biggest NWO supporters...    And finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here  in the Boulder/Denver area, I would greatly appreciate it. I am in the  process of installing Linux and so will be able to do UUCP or maybe  a TC/IP connection. Any help here would be greatly appreciated.

I guess I'm still not clear on what the term ""candida bloom"" means,  but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal  infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.

Lucky how?  Since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of  oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, I've mentioned to a   number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they  could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  It turns out most would  rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.    >yogurt dangerous).

Again, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and  has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.  There is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the GI tract with  bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in  reducing diarrhea, but I don't think anyone would view this as a  quack therapy.  --   David Rind  rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu "

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such  ""storys"" about them. OK ?  Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:     -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.           It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry            conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-           powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.           If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find           a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to           get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason           for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an           temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one            side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water           again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the            energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to           let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""           steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.           And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of           energy that carnot will give them.           The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !           The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,           because that steam is radioactive !

OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-           Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still           verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere           around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with           the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the           metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.           This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures           up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.        -3rd.

In practice,  communism has ""solved"" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_  productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the  rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  The mass butchery of ""kulaks""  in the USSR is a good instance of this.      A poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which  people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  I often wonder  just what Castro would have done if the Cubans presently in Miami would  have been forced to remain in Cuba.  Would they have revolted and killed  him off, or been killed?      Best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,  load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that  most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of  obedience, prison, or flight.  This would be a bad science-fiction novel,  if the East Germans hadn't actually done it.  The last person to die  crossing the wall, as I recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the  back.  Erich Honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to  socialists in Chile.      It's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes  it's a sheer waste of time.    --Erich Schwarz / schwarze@starbase1.caltech.edu "

The survey presented, according to Mr. Cramer,  a value called the median- which one used this makes us   believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and  1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners.  Homosexuals  are purported to make up only 1%.  In this case, the majority  of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual.    It is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage.

Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential  step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be  shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space  station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920,   the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic   genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of   annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering   2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year   homeland.    The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance  of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

But this is all gun control laws end up doing.  Politicians can never  manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally, so all their  laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally.    Karen McNutt, a local attorney, states that there are about two MILLION  licensed gun owners in Massachusetts.  In the past year, the number of  licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like SIX.  Yet, there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year.

See, this is what I call the ""argument from religion:"" ""I believe.""  Don't  believe -- it's not NECESSARY to take this on faith.  Go look at the history  of countries that passed gun restrictions.  Pay particular attention to  whether or not violent crime was HIGHER before the restrictions and LOWER  after.  (Don't look at ""violent gun crimes,"" that's begging the question.)  You may be very surprised.    > If ALL crimes done with guns stopped AND all accidents also stopped or  > was reduced to a minimum THEN I would consider lifting all gun control.    You have this absolutely backwards.  If crime stopped in the presence of  strict gun control, there is NO WAY I would consider lifting any of it.  However, if gun control made absolutely NO IMPROVEMENT in the violent   crime rate, THAT'S when I would have it lifted.  Think about it.    So far, none of the stats show any improvement...    > Likevise if car-accidents fell to a minimum in europe, I (and probably  > most people I know) would demand easier drivers-tests.  > (ca. 20 hours and more than 2500$ today....)    Do you really think driver's tests are any indication of your propensity  for having accidents?      I've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while   drunk; after having been up all night; with two fighting kids in the   back seat; with a hot cup of coffee on their lap; or while putting on   makeup, reading the newspaper, or talking on their cellular phone.

I know that when working in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware  that I was paying for health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees  were listed seperately on my pay stub.    While I'm not the only Canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks  in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  See our polls ...  A better one might be the July 1st polls conducted for Macleans (our  major English newsmagazine) by Decima Research ... Decima president  Allen Gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,  and Mulroney's Conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in  the face of impossible election situations.  I haven't had a chance  to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones  before the Americans started their assault and disinformation had  shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an American all-private  system had support within statistical noise.  The Decima polls are  considered definitive.  Even the new Reform Party, a breakoff of  traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian""  faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that  just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average  Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American  counterparts on issues like these).    Personally, I feel that the universal health insurance approach used  in Canada, France and Germany -- paying to private health providers in  a nominally free market not unlike America's, minus HMO's -- depends a  lot on values in those societies different from the U.S.  The basic  health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does  allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on  the level of ownership of a VCR as Americans would see it.

Yeah, but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested  mistakenly and has their life turned upside-down because some law  enforcement agency *does* make a chip::person association?    I wonder if there are any plans to keep these records (e.g. encode the  serial number into the UPC scanned at K-Mart along with the credit  card info, voila.)    At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or  whatever (i.e. to be coming from your telephone number the person  likely is in your house etc.), plus or minus some shenanigans of  course.    But I'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id, recording  the conversation, then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes  up as owner of that id (mistakenly, maybe you sold the phone at a  garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever.) They  might only know who one side of the conversation is, for example.    Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such  databases loses two points. First, law enforcement agencies can of  course do this. Second, they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any  money for it. The IRS, for example, does do this anyhow. They just  don't spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess.    Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like  mastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* of  opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.)    I know, an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen, I  could hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone during  a dispute I had with them (to intimidate me, actually, not much of a  dispute, I didn't particularly disagree, but for some reason this  fellow wanted to play tough guy with me, I hope he's better now.)

(Moreover, we know now that Kratz' sample is  unrepresentative.)  We can look at the reasoning.  It is basically  ""these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third  generation.""  Part of that is true, but since those same people don't  claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are  dangerous, we see that the argument fails.    >me to quote my sources because I don't keep a ton of gun magazines and/or    Why would I care?  I'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.    >rec.guns articles laying around.  Boy, you can't make a simple statement on  >here without someone getting right on your ass.    One can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone  ""getting right on your ass"".  One merely has to make accurate simple  statements.  Then you get ""attaboy""s by mail and publically.    Accuracy is a severe burden, but most of us manage it.    -andy  -- "
