""In the months preceding the Arab invasion [of   1948], and while the five Arab states were conducting   preparations, we continued to make sallies into Arab   territory.

(Yitzhak Rabin, Le Monde, 29 February 1968)    27. ""To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our   frontiers [in 1967] were in position to threaten the   existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the   intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of   situation, but above all an insult to the Zahal [Israeli   army]""  (General Res. Matti Peled, Ha'aretz,  19 March 1972)    28. ""when we have broken the strength of the Arab   Legion and bombarded Amman, we would wipe out   Transjordan; after that Syria would fall....we would thus   end the war, and would have put paid to Egypt, Assyria   and Chaldea on behalf of our ancestors""  (David Ben Gurion in his diaries, quoted in Michael Bar-  Zohar,  The Armed Prophet, A Biography of Ben-Gurion,   Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.139)    29. ""These Jews of the Diaspora would like to see us, for   their own reasons, heroes with our backs to the wall. But   this wish can in no way change the realities.""  (Israeli General Ezer Weizmann, Le Monde, 3 June 1972)    30. ""Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian   Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue   against their hatred ? For eight years now they sit in   their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes,   we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in   which they and their forefathers have lived. We are a   generation of settlers, and without the steel helmet and   the cannon we cannot plant a tree and build a home. Let   us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting   and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of Arabs,   who sit all around us. Let us not avert our gaze, so that   our hand shall not slip. This is the fate of our generation,   the choice of our life - to be prepared and armed, strong   and tough - or otherwise, the sword will slip from our   first, and our life will be snuffed out.""  (Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal   Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists,   Collier Books, Macmillan, New York, 1971, p.154)     "
1,"Message-ID: <1qu75d$256@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu>  NNTP-Posting-Host: thor.ins.cwru.edu         I have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by  this anti-Israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable  sounding name of the 'Center for Policy Research.'  Obviously, it  is no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published  documents to find material to use against Israel makes it so.         Labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising  in itself.  That is simply part of the propaganda process.  I was  curious if anyone knew who this anti-Israel fanatic hiding behind  his phoney 'research center' name is.  Is he an Arab?  Is he some  typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  Is  he some Jew who perhaps lived in Israel and just couldn't make it  there, and is now taking his failure out on Israel?         Let's shed some light on this clown once and for all.  It will  help put his nonsense in the proper perspective.  And the readers  of this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-Israel  hyperbola can ignore this junk.   "

A genocide of Armenians took place  during peacetime.    And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in  those days. He was still young. Born in 1926.    On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there   was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we   didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they  wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd   near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home   watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir   Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our   house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields  there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the   direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and   started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off   the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the  light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know   and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.    Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:  there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother  Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War   II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.    We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down   with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, ""What's going on? What's   happened?"" They say, ""Armenians, get out of here!"" We don't open the door, we   say, ""If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow."" They say, ""No,   leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!"" By now they've   broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best  we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other.   We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,  and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and  when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no  police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We   held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an   axe, and then with a crowbar.    When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them   with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars,   pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father   in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the  room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother  Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he  was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured   several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But   they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there  were many of them.    The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go   into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought   skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father   bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head,   and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw   that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove  them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the   bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in   there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to   chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of   about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and  Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and   started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through  the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no   one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader   of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a   fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: ""What's with you,   woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?""  She says, ""What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!"" My father   was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian   and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says,   ""The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he   brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person."" He says, ""You   don't need to shout, stop shouting."" And when they heard the voice of this   man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and   started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left,   too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't   know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even  though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started   to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to   call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all   evening and all through the night.    Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were   from Khachmas. They said, ""We heard that a group was here at your place, you   have our condolences."" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay  in the room.    So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,  we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around   one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy,   investigators. They say, ""Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back   here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.""  Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take   Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take   Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,  but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the   neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should   hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and   went up to the neighbor's.    The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,  ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a   landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A  crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings  19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking   into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians   weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they   poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were   some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. ""They're up there, still,  up there. Let's go kill them!"" They broke up all the furniture remaining in   the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding   one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door   shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling   the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it,   and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, ""No, that's from some of the   furniture."" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed   him down.    The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and   went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also  Armenians, they had left for another city.    The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, ""Are you   crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the   apartments? They could kill you and them!"" And to us :"" . . . Come on, leave   this apartment!"" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At  first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and  he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound  of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went   downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the   other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down.   They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal   they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our  Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.    With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were   saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely   accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the   crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only  able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on   the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We   were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our  share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the   troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been   even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the   genocide.    Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the   leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their   orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '  pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock   in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was   quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried   Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were   about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It   was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people   there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being  taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well,   there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It   was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The   child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible  to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a   man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces   were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...    Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what   happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my   father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.    I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was  established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what   happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.    I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They  even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel   mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They   weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our   troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right  across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The   inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the   soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They   weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were   at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket   office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing   Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that   they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department   came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though  perhaps they could have come and saved us.    As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus   station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in   fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in   which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had  lists, the bandits. You can tell that the ""operation"" was  planned in advance.    Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the  leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian  people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops   suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my   family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait  Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would  have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.    At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR  Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest  possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could   happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted  out for such deeds.    Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass   disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,  very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There   were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took   part in the pogrom of our building all in all.    They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that   retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

Even if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and they  clearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86  blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:    1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might find  oneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near term  that require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting a  few weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December with  preferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.    2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations of  what would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respects  beside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given to  unsophisticated investors in late 1986 to ""sell now and save on  taxes.""  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similar  advice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advice  was based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),  but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates  (without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).    It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimal  economic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionless  pulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describe  accurately what happens in the real world.      --   MORAL: Always Choose the Right Sort of Parents          Before You Start in to be Rough                                          - George Ade  	Mark Eckenwiler    eck@panix.com    ...!cmcl2!panix!eck "

2,"  Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]  >And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN  >news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild  >idea"" stage or does it have real funding?          Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the  Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:      SPACE ADVERTISING      First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very  common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the  space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the  (very prominent) logos on its side of     - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)     - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)     - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and     - the GPS/Navstar program office     This has not been considered ""paid advertising"" but rather  ""public relations"", since the restrictions have been such that only  organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the  side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting  a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras  is ""advertising"" as much as it is ""public relations"", in my  opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has  rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]     There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials  for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large  advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of  several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at  putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload  bay.  These ventures would be different than ""public relations"", in  that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms  participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for  the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For  example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a  Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras  would scan past it.)      ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES     The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about  1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed  to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe  company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,  Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last  Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from  participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for  example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the  British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.     Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch  vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET  recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements  on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie ""The Last  Action Hero"".  Besides the usual logos of the participating  organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the  main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster  rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for  one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in  Space News magazine a couple of months ago.     (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is  talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he  created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising  sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the  space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on  the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it ""would not use  his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and  receiving compensation.""   This is being disputed, since the launch  is a ""commercial launch"" and NASA is receiving none of the  advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is  coming from NASA.)      ORBITAL ""BILLBOARDS""     Orbital ""billboards"" have been the staple of science fiction for  some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert  Heinlein described another in ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"".  Several  different potential projects have been developed, although none have  been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the ""Eiffel  II"" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in  orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

It has always been up to the Azeris to end their announced winning of Karabakh   by removing the Armenians! When the president of Azerbaijan, Elchibey, came to   power last year, he announced he would be be ""swimming in Lake Sevan [in   Armeniaxn] by July"". Well, he was wrong! If Elchibey is going to shell the   Armenians of Karabakh from Aghdam, his people will pay the price! If Elchibey   is going to shell Karabakh from Fizuli his people will pay the price! If   Elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing Armenia from the hills of   Kelbajar, his people will pay the price.     It also seems other non-Azeri minorities in Azerbaijan have understood they  are next in line in this process of forced Azerification or deportation. Just   look at the situation with the Lezgians.    About the Kurds...what Kurds! According to the Azerbaijani government, there   are no Kurds in Azerbaijan. Can't they make up their minds? Oh I see, there   are only Kurds when the Azeris want them to be Kurds! And anyway, this ""60   Kurd refugee"" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in   Baku, modified in Ankara. Other examples of this are Armenia has no border   with Iran, and the ridiculous story of the ""intercepting"" of Armenian military   conversations as appeared in the New York Times supposedly translated by   somebody unknown, from Armenian into Azeri Turkish, submitted by an unnamed   ""special correspondent"" to the NY Times from Baku. Real accurate!    [h]       However, I hope that the Armenians WILL force a TURKISH airplane   [h]       to LAND for purposes of SEARCHING for ARMS similar to the one  [h]       that happened last SUMMER. Turkey searched an AMERICAN plane  [h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to ARMENIA.  [h]    No, Henrik, these Turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.    [HE]	Don't speak about things you don't know: 8 American Cargo planes  [HE]	were heading to Armenia. When the Turkish authorities  [HE]	announced that they were going to search these cargo   [HE]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in Germany.  [HE]	5 of these planes were searched in Turkey. The content of  [HE]	of the other 3 planes? Not hard to guess, is it? It was sure not  [HE]	humanitarian aid.....    Your ""facts"" in error. Shipments of all kinds that have transversed Turkey   have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. Some American planes  were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. Rail shipments   were held up last fall and last winter from entering Armenian from Turkey  for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of Armenia. Wheat was  confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with ""crap"" and dirt, then  shipped to Armenia. U.S. planes don't have to use Turkish air bases. The U.S.  uses these bases to bomb Iraq. Anyway, U.S. planes can fly over Georgia, which  they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of Turkish   chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed   anything other than a paranoid Turkish military.     [HE]	Search Turkish planes? You don't know what you are talking about.  [HE]	since it's content is announced to be weapons?     Well, big mouth Ozal said military weapons are being provided to Azerbaijan  from Turkey, yet Demirel and others say no. No wonder you are so confused!

I remember at least 1 on an old  Jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....I mean, if the  cancer risk was that great, the Europe who have been circumcising like  crazy, too. Teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a  little proper hygiene goes a long way - Americans are just too hung up on  the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like  mastubation.

Deal?    A more realistic offer would be:    Those who object to paying for abortion can instead pay for the (greater)  cost of delivery that those who couldn't afford an abortion (and wanted  one) would be forced to go through, while those of us who do not object to  public funding of abortions for those who can not afford medical care on  their own can pay for the (smaller) cost of an abortion for those who  decide that is what is best for them, but are unable to afford it on their  own.  Funny how those who object to paying *their* money to pay for *other's*  abortions end up paying *more* money than if they hadn't objected.  People  need to realize that where *your* individual tax money goes is a meaningless  concept.  It is probably unlikely that the fraction of your taxes that would  actually *on average* go towards such abortions would cover the cost of even  *one* entire abortion.  (Consider how many taxpayers there are, how many  abortions are performed, and how many would likely be paid for by public  funds, and how much you pay in taxes and how much a typical abortion would  cost.  I think the factors on the order of 1/1000 involved will swamp the  rest.)    (It's more realistic because we don't really object to paying for delivery,  etc for those women who *chose* that, but can't afford it.)    >Adrienne Regard    -Rob "

The description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the  key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding  to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the  result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either  way there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  It isn't  clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must  be provided by other system components.

Somebody correct (flame) me please!    I *cannot* *believe* I am posting in this thread, but what  the hell, he asked for it.    I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing  I was bi.  ""So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd never  end up with a guy anyway.""  As several people on soc.bi pointed  out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships  or just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gay  culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily  find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so  choose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that's just from  hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a  week, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in  bars or something.)    So the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless of  course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population.    As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic,  and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males  are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're  closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship.  Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender  roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've  *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to  be more sex.  Or that what's ""dysfunctional"", what's ""screwed up""  is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what   encourages deviant behavior in gay males.    (also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners   doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous,  but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily  closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with  strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships,  and be monogamous or nearly so...)      --                                                                       ____  Alan Jaffray (jaffray@math.uchicago.edu)  Email, 'talk' always welcome.  \bi/  Those who dance are thought mad by those who hear not the music -- Anon   \/  B0H7f-t+w-cg+(+)k+?s-vm-h-pS6/3bgz-++o-x-v+j+N0178l--+a(+)f-vn-(++)e--+dvb+u+ "

Well, they can't listen in on much of mine, since I already use  cryptography for much of my electronic mail, and will start using it  for my telephony as soon as practical.    However, allow me to tell a parable.    There was once a far away land called Ruritania, and in Ruritania  there was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in  Ruritainia were transparent. Now, in the days when people had lived in  mud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood  technology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in  Ruritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until  this point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on  someone's home, but the new technology made this tempting. This being  a civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars  and watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,  would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going  on. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but  everyone pretended that this didn't happen.    One day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,  suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Things  would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely  private.    Indignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have  video cameras installed in every nook and cranny. ""After all"", they  said, ""with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing  video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --  they are just keeping the old one.""    A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the  lives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the  mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that  Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was  expedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it  had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to  solve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its  expedience. Indeed, ""why have warrants at all"", he asked, ""if we are  interested only in expedience?""    A famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She  noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating  should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,  and the law was passed.    Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths  while speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading  their lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the  police said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their  lawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never  before been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but Dorothy  Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of  covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and  mutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused  of being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one  wanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked, so a  compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with  microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man  lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old  lip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were  installed everwhere.    However, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent  citizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of  them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not  understand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at  all times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that  they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. ""After all"",  Dorothy Quisling pointed out, ""they might be using the opportunity to  speak in private to mask terrorist activities!""  Terrorism struck  terror into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of  this new law.    Meanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all  of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which  all Ruritanians were proud. ""Why"", he asked, ""are we obligated to  sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police  easier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in  crime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!""    However, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law  required, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a  microphone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived  and took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture  was, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been  recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene  thoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the  major problems of the new age of plenty and joy.    --  Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com  --  Laissez faire, laissez passer.

See the discussion of ""high-power rocketry"" in the rec.models.rockets  frequently-asked-questions list.    This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need  proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-  power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend  the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.    You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under  one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not  especially hard to arrange.    As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled  properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty  air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with  model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which  eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry.  --   All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                      - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry "
1,"    DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]                Born 1972            Attended 9th Grade            Middle School No. 17              Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25            Microdistrict No. 3            Sumgait [Azerbaijan]    Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came   home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period   in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was   the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and   other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first   cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and   on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring   that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.    When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped   by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.   The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus  begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to   the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking   passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not   taken for Armenians.    We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old   building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was   packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th   Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking  passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.  Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning  cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death to  the Armenians"" was written on the cars.    When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still  quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call   Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.   Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to   come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us  to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you   enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was   beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,   that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people   were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very   long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,   looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said   things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a  car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that   they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that   there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of   the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later   found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri  Avakian was killed, too.    When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go   home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We   started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We  tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We  decided she had already left.    We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my  father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's  work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our  town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get  out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,  but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the  call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke  down the door and came into the apartment . . .    They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians   were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we   could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He   read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alone  was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the   courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,   pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They   had knives and steel truncheons.    I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if  I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents   and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded  that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken   outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to  push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind   her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began   beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.    We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their   balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they   strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I   lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the  first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are  lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from   their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is   broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an   ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.    We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and   try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,   they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our   neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she  sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the   window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a   result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken   away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken   away, and everything will be OK.    But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the  ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received  attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12   o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with   some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,   and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds  on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are   in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.    In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them  Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only  Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,  before the 27th.    Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was   released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first   they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out   that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.    My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My   mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the   leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.    They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their  heads were smashed open and bled profusely.    At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out   later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called   specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address   and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.  Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the   phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He   denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father   answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he   called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of   automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had   never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20   years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he   was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.    My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was   two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to  go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He  went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural   projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and   later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from   the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in   a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.      My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I  always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it  was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and  wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military  School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-  sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join   the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life  long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it  more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,  and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.    Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home   of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.    While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had  suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at  their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long  time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I  also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped    . . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,  about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with  his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and  his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even  came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But  in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of  others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .    Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,  was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to   recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.  I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision  of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of   Armenia.    After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give  Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live  peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they  can do that.    I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.  After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I   think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.    You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno  Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had   even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move   here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and   that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was  wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct   a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies   in the hands of our government.

If the Mormons fortified Utah and armed it to the teeth,  >and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.    Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage,  the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to ""defend the  faith"", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a  lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives  for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their  sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.    So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very  impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend  secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually  do - even to the point of suicide.)  So he hired virtually no one but  Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the  Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI  personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.    I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment  of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.    --   =	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=	=  Michael McClary						mcclary@netcom.com  For faster response, address electronic mail to:	michael@node.com "

2,"     I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.     About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes   under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement   of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of   the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced   the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor    suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.     While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being    manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently   increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (   palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part   the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had   been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the   pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is    persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3   and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides   minor reductions in pain and is only short term.       My questions are:          Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the       levels of pain?         Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?         Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?        Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.            Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.      If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup    that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.                          --   Gregory W.

If indeed Israeli soldiers killed a ""Hamas Mujahid"" with an anti-tank missile  then I'm almost sure that the ""terrorist zionists"" would not have been able  to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the missile.

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on  distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel   that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum   you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to   another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.    I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line,   lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan   to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is   nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in   x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship,   that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel   free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,  the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian  criminal organizations.    Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men,  women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and   those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.    Not a chance.    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are  significant difference between making rules for *use on public property*  and *making rules for ownership*.

Safety classes which are  never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for  a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York,  Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun  owners would, in theory, support these planes.

0,"  Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a  couple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.  spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C  and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time  delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this  application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger  pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is  disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.  When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x  the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can  be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting  any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it  is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K  resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of  2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)  Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for  256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.  After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14  day timing cycle and so forth.    Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the  electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet  puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to  keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to  work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts  to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see  what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that  has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns  off ;-)    Thanks again everyone...    -=-= Wes =-=- "

Someone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have  continued access to our communications, they already have it.  The  problem is that, yes the do have access, and probably more than  we realize.  The government wants exclusive access to communications  intercept here in the united states, cutting out other access detrimental  to the national security (tm).    I also doubt that a certain3 letter agency, that originated the encryption  algorithm and the chip designs needs to have anything to do with the   escrow system to continue their intercept effort.

Who gets to keep what parts of Judea and Samaria will be determined in  a peace settlement.  Obviously, Israel will keep some, and the Arabs  will get some.    Israel has tried to get out of Gaza almost from the time it got stuck  with it.  It has been refused by the Arabs several times.  Although  there are some Israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up, I  seriously doubt Israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in any  settlement.    The Golan Heights is a serious security problem, and Israel obviously  will have to keep part of it and give up part of it.  (One should  remember that the Golan Heights had been part of the area that was to  be in Britain's Palestine Mandate, slated to become part of the Jewish  state, until Britain traded it to France for other considerations.  In  other words, it is an historical accident that it was ever part of  Syria.)  --   Alan H. Stein                     astein@israel.nysernet.org "
2,"    There is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss.  The   few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher  ently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it).    Theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. The claim is that chromium  will increase muscle mass and decrease fat.  Of course, chromium is also used t  o cure diabetes, high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just  as well as anabolic steroids). Sounds like snake oil for the 1990's :-)   On the other hand, it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet, and place  bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...                                        -Paul       ----------------------------------------------------------      |  Paul Sovcik, Pharm.D.

0,"Nntp-Posting-Host: goyt.csc.liv.ac.uk    Hi,       I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitor  voltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx   260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases  and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output  voltage as possible. (about 260v).    The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages  (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v  across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.    Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.   If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will  increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.  These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of  them, So:    1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel   with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?    Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase  the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more  stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...  as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new  capacitor will 'smooth' this out.    and  2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to  be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out  the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !      I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH  of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my   dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not  playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long  run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)    Email please.... Can't always read the net.....    Thanks in advance..

The receivers   look much like what you describe, but they include a UHF whip antenna (less  than a foot tall) and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that   an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching.

Anyway, I've got some servos lying around, and I wanted to do some things  with them using digital logic.  I know all about having to pulse the signal  and everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative  (yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction   opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.    Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as  an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how  would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all  three signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.    Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Also, please reply via email, as I  never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.    Thanks much,  -mark    umlangston@memstvx1.memst.edu       "

I think your experiences under the Bulgarian regime are highly relevant.  We have too many people with their heads in the sand saying it cannot  happen here, as our Constitutional Rights are being trashed every day  because the government justifies doing some end-run around the protections  by a 'crisis' requiring 'drastic action'.   It is most likely that in the  future possession of secure encryption tools will be regarded as possession  of 'terrorist and drug dealers tools', and be some serious Fedaral Felony.  Just like common tools are 'burgular tools' if the police say so, common  computer programs (even computers themselves) are now 'hackers tools',  and will become 'terrorist tools'.  BET ON IT.    The insights of someone who has lived throught this are very important.  If the US goes the way of the old Soviet Union and its client states  as far as individual rights, privacy and overall freedom are concerned,  the rest of the world (remember 'New World Order'?) will not be far  behind - only a few years.    Please keep posting anything you find that is deficient or that threatens  ones rights in this thing.    For example, a conversation between a suspect and a lawyer will no longer  be private from Big Brother eavesdropping.  Political dissent allready  is very dangerous in this country, all it takes is the government to  decide that enough people will take one seriously, then one becomes  guilty of 'plotting to overthrow the government by illegal means'.  The  phrase 'illegal means' is defined as whatever the government wants it  to be defined as.    Couple this with Clinton's pressing for a 'smart' National ID card (an  'Internal passport'?), with the added wrinkle that anything about you and  your past can be put on it, and you can only take the government's  word as to what is really on it (since they will be the only ones  with the means to completely read and reprogram the thing).  Isn't  that nice?    While the Feds can bust into one's safe without the keys, the owner  knows his safe has been broken into.  When they break into your 'secure'  phone conversations (or other stored/transmitted data in the near future)  you have no way of knowing, so accountability as to the legalities has  gone out the window.  Just like a safe, if they have a legal cause, they  can get the keys from the suspect, just like they can get the keys to  a safe or the combination from the suspect.  Same with encryption:  Record everything, get the warrants, THEN decode it with the keys  obtained from the suspect.    This Clinton Cripple, along with its natural extensions, will make any  priviliged communications between client and lawyer, and any meaningful  political dissent virtually impossible.  Which is the general idea.  Any propeganda about its being secure, and the safeguards, and all  of that are just that - propeganda to reassure people so they will  by into this monstrosity.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to  chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is  something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much  more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an  autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which  also leads to cirrhosis.      Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous  effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.   Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,  among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic  circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of  hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.   These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in  men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for  cirrhosis is liver transplant.    Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in  your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the  subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he  or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to  you, and offer you support.    Simon.   "

2,"  Hello all,              There is a small problem a friend of mine is experiencing and I   would appreciate any help at all with it.    My friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring   antidepressants for a cure. The main problem is the side effects of these.   So far she has been prescribed Prozac, Aurorix, and tryptanol all with   different but unbearable side effects.    The Prozac gave very bad anxiety/jitters and insomina, it was impossible to   sit still for more than a minute or so.    The Aurorix whilst having a calming effect, all feelings were lost and the   body co-ordination was similar to a drunken person. Her brain was clouded   over.    The tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco-   ordination occurred. She did not know what she was doing as her brain was   ""closed down"".    Has anyone had similar problems and/or have any suggestions as to the next   step?    Thankyou in advance.    Gordon Taylor  E-mail: blubird@penguin.equinox.gen.nz "

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost,  and you don't want to clip off the panels each time.    For the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that  there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks,  etc.) used for deployment.  This was partially so that everything could  be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially for  safety considerations.  (I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile  would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened.)

I have  >not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been  >reported, but I could have easily missed it.    Please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality  of other strong cryptosystems.   So far any references I have seen  have been weasel-words (""more plans in the future, etc""), but nothing  that could be taken as a ""NO (strong crypto will NOT be outlawed)"".  I  have heard (not verified) that the Crime Bill before Congress has  language that either requires escrow of keys, or that will regard  all systems 'unapproved' for public use, like strong cryptosystems  not trivially broken by the Govt, or without escrowed keys  which one cannot readily change (read: use being only permitted by  folks with 'special' connections, or government agencies) as either  'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'.  Not outlawed SPECIFICALLY  but by added Civil Forfeiture powers, and clever wording, EFFECTIVELY  outlawed for all intents and purposes.    Now, for some idle speculation ... for those who don't care, hit 'n' now.    Crypto being EFFECTIVELY outlawed could be done without SPECIFICALLY  outlawing ANY class of crypto systems.  For example, a crowbar, hammers,  screwdrivers, and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much  at the whim of the authorities, based primarily on the individual  possessing them in the car, etc. not being in a trade that makes routine  use of these tools.  In a like manner, one who has no 'legitimate need'  (gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems, and is caught  using them, might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'.  In other words, if one is not working for a corporation with extremely  sensitive commercial data that warrants (in the Fed's opinion) strong  security, or a government agency, and securing only work-related data,  not personal data, one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.  A personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as  a 'legitimate NEED':   ""Why do you want such strong security, especially from 'legitimate law  enforcement'? An individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so  concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal  secrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning  to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity...  DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING  TO HIDE, HMMMM?""  I expect that initially there will be some people selected either at  random, or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of  'making an example' for those who think the Feds are not SERIOUS about  this... (mega ':-('s)    One asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that  there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out AS SUCH (an  argument used in the abortion debate):  ""You do NOT have a right to have  security that 'Legitimate Law Enforcement cannot break'"" (as suggested  in the Clipper Press Release).    This, in a nutshell, is what I find so extremely frightening.  Not only  for crypto systems, as in this case, but for the precident it will set,  laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both  safe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately  owned safes, and so on.  WHY NOT?)...    I cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those  'inconvenient' parts of the US Constitution.  A law cannot be easily  declared unconstitutional, if it there IS NO SPECIFIC LAW.  It would  simply be a minor extension of the RICO statutes or WoD policies. A  simple policy decision, just like so many of the gun regulations are  mainly BATF policy decisions...  The Conversation of the Fed agents  would go something like:    ""We are gonna seize your home, your computers, your car, your bank  account, (you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes, unless you  have a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your  acquisition, transport, and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers  tools' - part of the WoD or against terrorism, ya unnerstand... no  decent American Subject would be against these noble causes..."".    ""Note we are not accusing YOU of any wrong-doing ... we are only saying  your HOME, COMPUTERS, CAR, BANK ASSETS are connected with wrong-doing  SOMEHOW - they housed, transported, and funded these 'terrorist tools'.  Only a civil matter ...  <heh-heh> ... We had this 'tip'...<grin>"".    ""Therefore, the Constitutional Protection on Individual rights do NOT  apply - we are 'arresting' the tainted PROPERTY... not YOU...<evil grin>"".    ""If you wish to deposit a BOND, hire some attorneys, and go to court to  PROVE the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools'  and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools'), go ahead,  we have no problem with that!  'Course, with your bank assets seized,  no car, computer, or home, (probably no job, too) and your  less-than-limitless resources, you might run into some minor practical  difficulties <grin>..."".    THAT is what has me going so damned ballistic...  It is EXACTLY how  the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been  used to store DRUGS...  Note no trace of drugs need to be found on  the property... only some bozo who will say 'yup.  I stored stuff in  that dude's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for  dealing).  Much more cost effective to let him walk, to bust another  day, and hit the jackpot with YOUR assets...    Ob Disclaimer (of course)...    Ok, note that I am not a lawyer, and can only base these speculations  on what I have read/heard/been told regarding past Civil Forfeiture  cases, and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies,  or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone, or who  do not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where  they are denied either meaningful police protection, AND the means to be  able to even pretend to defend themselves, as is quite common back East,  like NJ, MA, NYC, Wa DC, or out West in CA).  These people have the  choice of cowering under the government boot, or cowering under threats  of pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers... helpless in either case...  All behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain, or behind  the Feds wanting to 'make an example'...  Civil Forfeiture being the 'hook'.    Point is, are these speculations way out of line, or are they all too  typical, and if so, does the extension to crypto and just about anything  that the Feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable?  And if not  why not (what are our guarantees, besides the government promises)?

The paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.    Texas state officials COULD and DID investigate child abuse charges.  They COULD and DID apprehend Koresh peaceably.  The COULD and DID  impound his weapons for the duration.  And Koresh was NOT CONVICTED.    Note that child abuse and similar accusations are STATE matters, not  federal.

Timor does deserve  the attention that Bosnia, Angola, etc. get.  But...I also think that the  ""press"" can't be forced to print articles, air shows about it, etc.  	The religious right got tired of the mainstream media and started  buying their own stations/papers.

The Indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who  doesn't get in their way: which is something the Khmer Rouge didn't do.   Virtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the ""killing fields"".

Or is that explanation too obvious?    	I don't agree.  Right now Australia is the most effective lever against  Indonesia.  They are negotiating for oil drilling rights off Timor, and  stopping that process would go a long way towards making Indonesia realize that  people don't want to see the situation swept under the rug.

Yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently not  so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to   carry it through. And, since they've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of   the bodies from the compound, there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who had  less constitutional fortitude. Then again, maybe the FBI ran in while the fire  was raging, executed those two, and ran out again.    Jason Durbin  Oracle Europe "

Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).  I'll give you some examples.    	1. Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no   	   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.    	2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid   	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.    	3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has   	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by   	   the NCI.    These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should   not committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of   which result in malpractice suits).  I don't think that using anti-fungal   agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be   having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of   commission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to   relieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,  others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a   chance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the   healer's oath, ""I will do no harm"".  But you know David that very few   treatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a   very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each   physician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some   are very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive   approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long   as the motive is improving the patient's health and not an attempt to rake   in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in   the medicare fraud cases), I don't see the need to label these healers as   quacks or even unethical.    What do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.    These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the   frustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are   really doing a pretty good job of providing ""alternative"" medicine.  But   many lack any formal training and are in the ""business"" simply to make a   few fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting   competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative   care area is really a buyer's beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find   someone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of   money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-  medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the   liscened physicians).    I hope that this clears things up David.    Marty B. "

At  nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas  fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot  water.

After arriving, the Pilgrims made all  property common.  They all shared in the work and the resulting crops  went into a common store.  After much debate the new Governor Bradford  privitized the land; assigning plots to each family.  According to Perry  D. Westbrook:  ""The change was immediately justified by the increased  industry of the inhabitants and by the larger acreage planted.""    Bradford himself acknowledged this failure of communism.  He wrote:  ""The  experience that was had in this common course and condition, tried  sundry years and that amongst godly and sober men, may well evince the  vanity of that conceit of Plato's and other ancients applauded by some of  later times; that the taking away of property and bringing in community into  a commonwealth would make them happy and flourishing; as if they were wiser  than God.  For this community (so far as it was) was found to breed much  confusion and discontent and retard much employment that would have been  to their benefit and comfort.""    Bradford did not blame this failure on the ""strangers"", but on the basic  selfishness in all men.  He wrote ""seeing all men have this corruption in  them, God in his wisdom saw another course fitter for them.""  In other  words, according to Westbrook, ""Bradford found private enterprise to be  the most suitable economic policy for mankind in its fallen state.""    Let's not make the same mistake that the Pilgrims made.  Private  property allows a society to flourish, the alternative brings  starvation, poverty and discontent.  --   Paul Schmidt: Advocates for Self-Government, Davy Crockett Chapter President  706 Judith Drive, Johnson City, TN 37604, (615)283-0084, uunet!tijc02!pjs269  ""Freedom seems to have unleashed the  creative energies of the people -- and  leads to ever higher levels of income and social progress.""  --  U.N. report "

By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned  physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down   into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by  increasing intra-abdominal pressure....  Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only   detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.   Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous  operation, I can't tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best  position to make that determination.    Are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then   folks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far  too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.      ====================================    Howard Doyle  doyle+@pitt.edu "

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and     N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:      	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1]   	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .       R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The     first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The     rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2     are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow     agencies.    Hmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial  number N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2  is an intentional way of assuring a ""fail safe"" for the government --  U is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not  change they constitute effective ""master keys"" (along with F), the  theft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)  completely obviates the security of the system. However, more  interestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no  matter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1  and U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space  if it NOT to provide an additional back door?    I find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on  approximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on  the back of a napkin.    Even if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this  restriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is  assuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the  goal is an illusion of security.    If S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if  they can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number  pairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one  understands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,  soon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via  espionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well  -- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but  by the time we know it may be too late.       As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are     written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a     file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part     U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third     disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent     2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.     After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the     vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional     assurance that no information is left behind.    None of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of  ""destroying the laptop"" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.  We all know that you can't read data from DRAM that has been turned  off for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don't know  is why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the  first place other than to weaken the system. We don't know if the  agents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their  information -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make  the bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing  this in a ""vault"" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room  with a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make  high-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little  for most of the rest of us.       The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the     room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,     and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to     the escrow agencies.    What would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and  the NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always  honest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they  have the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don't need to  steal they keys as they effectively already have them.    --  Perry Metzger		pmetzger@shearson.com  --  Laissez faire, laissez passer.

2,"  Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine.  It can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage.  An odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine.  People with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything  else rich in phenylalanine.    Aspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptoms.  Pat Robertson's program _The_700_Club_ was beating the drum against  aspartame rather vigorously for about a year, but that issue seems to  have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so.  Apparently,  the evidence is not very strong, or Pat would still be flailing away. "

Unfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector    essentially doesn't give any additional security. I got 3 answers (from    grady@netcom.com, Mark.Lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk, smb@research.att.com) that    opened my eyes. It's pretty simple:    Say E is encryption (and D decryption) with key K on 64-bit blocks.    Let c[0] be the initialisation vector,  m[1], m[2], ... the message blocks,  c[1], c[2], ... the cipher text blocks.    Then encryption in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode works by the formula       c[i] = E(m[i] XOR c[i-1]),    and decryption by       m[i] = c[i-1] XOR D(c[i]).    So if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message    block m[1]. But she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ...    The situation in cipher feedback (CFB) mode is a bit more complicated but    similar and left as an exercise for the reader :-)    Finally there is the modified output feedback mode (OFB) where DES (or    whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by       s[i] = E(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0],    and encryption is given by       c[i] = m[i] XOR s[i].    Here the usual `known plaintext' attack against XOR-bitstream ciphers    reduces the cracking to key search for K.    --  Klaus Pommerening  Institut fuer Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation  der Johannes-Gutenberg-Universitaet  Obere Zahlbacher Strasse 69, W-6500 Mainz, Germany "

When kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade, infection   incidence was much lower because exposure was lower.  Some studies suggest   that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial   because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and   mortality(mumps, measles. etc.).    > -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?  > How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

Daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.    > -- Does being sick ""build immunity"" (leading to less illness later),  > does it make kids ""weaker"" (leading to more illness later), or does it  > not have any long term effect?    Exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity.  But many viruses   mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(  new antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline   with time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.  Chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression   but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.    > -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long  > term effects?    Yes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good   bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects   of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the   medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects   of chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).     > -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than  > normal, and what does one do about it?    Chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my   opinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is   normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many   infectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some   physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection   frequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to   result in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the   length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms   associated with the infection.    > -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?    There are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong   immune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C,   vitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this   is rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low   and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune   response.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are   distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of   these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe   infection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A   status, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for   vitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five   nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the   others that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I've worked up so far.  But my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the   critical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also   be able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a   nutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(  like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.  Many Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that's   what you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves   nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training   needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good   for getting general dietary advice from however.    > Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much  > appreciated.  Thanks a lot.  >   > Ashwin.

2,"  Hi Stephen  Ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing  a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  Too much can block the  external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some   hearing problems.  It is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your  own, or at your physician's office.  You can take a syringe (no needles!) and  fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% OTC hydrogen  peroxide.  Then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)  and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and    firmly expell the solution.  Depending on the size of the syringe and the  tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  If you place a bowl   under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  You can buy  a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever  you may have.  If wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  You can try  adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up  the wax.  Do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  It is also  safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse  it out.  Good Luck  -heather "

0,"    I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I  came across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling  components.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a  current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side  to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I  think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.    Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for  picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a  couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an  efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my  car battery in about half an hour).    Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic  specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the  temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably  its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we  have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no  leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the  two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more  (although that would be a lousy way to control it).    What I would like to know is:    1: Are the above guesses correct?    2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?     (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm     too fast when I unplug it)    3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like     magic!    4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?      Thanks in advance,    Paul.

Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920,   the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted   and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because   of race, religion and national origin?    As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and   idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A   short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda   and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious   for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their   neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely   within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to   x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is   the historic homeland and the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary   heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous,   even lunatic.     And we still demand:    1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian   dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;    2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and  Kurdish people;    3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their  heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;    4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide   and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian   political pressure.    The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the  efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first   genocide of the 20th century as a positive step.     Now what would you do?     Source: 'The Sunday Times,' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by           Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)        ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.        The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former  Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of  hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.      Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more  than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an  attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and  feared dead.      The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending  the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified  refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:"" That's when  the real  slaughter began,"" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to  survive. ""The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and  started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.""      "" They were shooting, shooting, shooting"", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who  arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through  Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed  in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.      One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.        The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,  were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their  wounds or the cold.      By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in  Agdam's morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the  seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were  women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.      Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they  had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep  stab wounds.      Nor were they safe in Agdam.

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia   recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various  type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell  were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy  a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to  either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some  point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.    Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code  down the lighting companies backs.

1,"    From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>  Subject: Help Palestinian education      HOW TO HELP PALESTINIAN EDUCATION    (From 'Educational Network', No. 11, April 1993,  publ. by Ramallah Friends Schools, P.O.Box 66,   Ramallah, West Bank, via Israel  Tel. 972-2-956230,  Fax. 972-2-956231)    Many of our readers have written to us asking how   individuals and organizations can help Palestinian   education. We have compiled a list of suggestions to guide   you. If you are interested in pursuing one or more of   these suggested activities, the Educational Network can   aid you by /coordinating/ the initial contacts, /following   up/, and /providing any other support/ you may need.    1.  Link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here   --- linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical   enterprise.    2. Get your union to actively support the right of   Palestinian teachers in the Occupied Territories to form   unions:    a. through the International Labor Organization (if your   union is a member)  b. contacting other international unions which have   supported our right to form a union -- we can supply   names and addresses.    3. Establish a SCHOLARSHIP FUND for one or more   Palestinian students to study at a Palestinian university   or school -- or establish a scholarship fund for a   Palestinian student or teacher to study at a university   abroad.    4. Reproduce and publish information about Palestinian   education:        a. for your union membership;      b. for the outside community.    The Educational Network can supply up-to-date   information and statistics.    5. Send delegations of teachers to visit the Occupied   Territories during periods when our schools are in   session.    The Network can arrange an itinerary, make hotel and   local travel arrangements, and provide a guide for the   visit.    6. Sponsor Palestinian teachers to visit your city for an   educational tour:          a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to            learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and             experiences;          b. to speak about the conditions of Palestinian            education.    The Network will coordinate from Palestine.    7. Establish teacher-exchange programs for one year in   which a Palestinian teacher from a private school teaches   at a public or private school abroad while a teacher from   that school spends a year in a Palestinian private school.    8. Send an experienced educator to the Occupied   Territories to give workshops (all-day workshops or two-  day workshops) on innovative teaching techniques.    The Network will pay for the person's food, lodging, and   travel while in Palestine, and will serve as guide.    9. Set up a pen-pal program with a Palestinian school in   either English or French.    10. Set up a sister-school program with a Palestinian   school which would actively involve teachers as well as   students at both schools -- a great tool for building   international understanding and mutual sensitivity.    11. Keep the Educational Network informed about   important educational conferences so that we can send a   Palestinian teacher to attend.    12. Send to the Educational Network articles or other   writings or books dealing with innovative approaches and   ideas in the field of education so that we can then   disseminate the information locally.    13. Support an educational development project in the   Occupied Territories.         "

Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact  that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much  of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the  industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired  and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point  where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that  the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,  Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.

The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a  Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations  can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),  Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in  1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were  within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well  within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only  a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.

1,"    jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu:       Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not     be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be     local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill     AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.     High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but     the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun     - and would pay through the nose for it.    Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,  homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate  fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall  the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for  use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of  effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of  killing German soldiers for their guns.    Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was  specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.  The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel  tubing, hand tools and a welder.    I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference  between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown  locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I  think the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling  economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the  result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have  firearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one way  or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.  --   Allan J. Heim   allanh@sco.COM   ...!uunet!sco!allanh   +1 408 427 7813 "

2,"    	Greetings. I've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators  	and learn the ""black magic"" art of switching power supplies...  	(before anyone flames me, I KNOW, both have their place :-)    	Anyways, I've built the basic up & down converters with pretty  	good results (>80% efficiency) but I'm running into problems  	when I try to design & build anything that puts out serious  	amps... I know it can be done (I have some 5V@200A guts on my  	bench) but something puzzles me: I'm using a simple choke as   	the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)  	but ALL commercial models use transformers with MANY windings.  	I traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for  	the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose  	me... What are they for? Better than that, anyone have a full  	schematic for one of these that I could get a copy of? I'd  	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such  	low volume :-)    	My other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are  	1) Lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2)  	Limited knowledge of the whole topic... I'm doing this on my  	own (not school) mind you (in fact, I have yet to take any  	course that covers transistors ;-)    	So, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercial  	models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what  	I'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematics  	and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory?     	Take care.    	P.S. My goal is 12V @ ~25A in (car battery) -> 250VAC out and  	(on the other end) 250V -> +5VDC @ 5A, -5V @ 1A, +12VDC @8A  	and -12VDC @1A... the distance between the two will be  	more than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.

The suffering that they are    Let us not forget about the genocide of the Azeri people in 'Karabag'   and x-Soviet Armenia by the Armenians. Between 1914 and 1920, Armenians   committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all conceivable methods of   despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol over babies and burned   them, raped women and girls in front of their parents who were bound   hand and foot, took girls from their mothers and fathers and appropriated   personal property and real estate. And today, they put Azeris in the most   unbearable conditions any other nation had ever known in history.                                     AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the  Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in  his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of  Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.    ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,""  the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the  Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to  be alive.""    Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity  for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12  days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the  2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the  edge of Karabakh.    ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard  before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy  machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.    Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction  of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started  fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the  snow into a forest on the other side.    To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam  about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,  until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two  Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.    ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by  a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening  fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.    Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward  to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts  were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his  group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman  son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his  67-year-old elder brother.    ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,""  he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We  have never got any of the bodies back.""    The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.  One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he  struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's  crossing, Mr Sadikov said.    Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and  several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy  hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three  Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.    As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was  little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was  soon to flee.    ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian  rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I  had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.  They even found a bullet in my sock.""    Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the  Hojali massacre in February  (left).

2,"Sender: news@adx.adelphi.edu (USENET News System)  Nntp-Posting-Host: auvax1  Organization: Adelphi University, Garden City NY  Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 08:46:08 GMT    There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding  practices here.  A few points need to be clarified:    The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or  the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to  carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the  voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It  should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the  normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in  the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding  conductor.      Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages  on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding  conductors to provide reliable operation  (""orange"" outlets are often used for  this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in  many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read  both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on  installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated  grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors  back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service  entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many  of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide  a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.     The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is  referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be  white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in  most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance  panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household  service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which  attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)      The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In  the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the  circuit from the panel to the load device.      Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding  conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance  from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but  measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,  under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the  grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of  the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since  there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also  no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment  has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U""  ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.   The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few  tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not  present a shock hazard.      HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact  with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,  a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to  flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you  will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)  Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in  some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of  inadequate size, causing it to overheat.    With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a  short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may  flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which  increases the possibility for shock or fire.      Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on  the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often  causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in  technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.    The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as  well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for  lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back  to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded  objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses  quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the  dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it  flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause  corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,  and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop  between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the  water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.   (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not  it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)    Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any  sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service  entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have  a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this  application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the  grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding  screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above  ground, with the possible problems listed above.    The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one  building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be  used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate  wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.   These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days  before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to  have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to  have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place  of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate  neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings  (since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the  wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.   So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,  it's primarily for lightning protection.    People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding  conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere  there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good  grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes  is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under  the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this  aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does  its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall  tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding  locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.      ""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty  sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have  the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and  inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the  greenfield.    ""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes  often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often  from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold  box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and  the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with  120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator  here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one  of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a  ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in  the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the  box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.    On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets  when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them  without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the  protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't  install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is  desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is  connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,  whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something  provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded  GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93  code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be  renumbered though.)     We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more  to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

Bosnian Muslims are slavic in ethnicity. They speak Serbo-Croatian. But  there is a Christo-Slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are Christian  and anyone who converted to Islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by  changing religion.  See the poems of Ngegos or the novels of Ivo Andric  who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls  ""the people"" (i.e. Christian slavs).  For this reason, the war-criminals  call all the Bosnian Muslims ""Turks"" even though they are not ethnically  Turk and do not speak Turkish as their first language.  For this reason,  what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically  identical but religiously ""other"" is called, paradoxically, ""ethnic  cleansing"" rather than ""religious cleansing.""    Thus, while a war rages between Serbs and Croats as a continuation of  WWII, and older agenda, the annihilation of Islam and Muslims from  Bosnian, is being carried out under the cover of the Serbo-Croat war.

As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six  different, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on  Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the   Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek.            Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all  flattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first.            Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.  But  I kind of doubt that.    >Any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare  >a private state has drifted into anarchy.

The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people,  says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of  surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it  slammed in their faces.            It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to  serve a warrant by knocking on the door.            There are at least questions that need to be answered.    >The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked  >assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish.             This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original  assault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing  concussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press.    >Had they  >expected the B-D to be anything other than peacefull citizens who  >would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up  >in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful  citizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would  have retreated immediately.            If they *were* expecting peacful citizens, why show up with over  a hundred officers, some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying   sub-machineguns, and *3* National Guard Helicopters?

1,"  The Branch Davidians were not violent and were not planning to start  violence.     When the BD compound was assaulted by the ATF the BD did fire back.  But they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the ATF to care for  their wounded.  The BD even released the ATF agents they captured.  It  is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the ATF medical  attention that the BD were not looking for trouble.     If the BD were violent they would have held the ATF agents as  hostages.  They would not have released them like they did.  If they  had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening  chips for medical attention etc.     A big thing is being made of the BD collection of weapons but no one  has shown that they had any plans to use them.  It is also apparent  that the BD did not have any military training.  If they had, they  could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their  fortifications.  They could have shot out the lights and speakers.  It  appears that the BD were not violent, they shot back at the attacking  ATF agents out of panic.  There were shots fired on the last day but  they were in response to the FBI attack on the compound with armor.     All the violence in Waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the  BD.          --  Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substitute  Boulder, CO                    | for brains is silence.  rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu         |       -Solomon Short-  satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      | "

There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.  For  example, the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs  NBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian  Federal computers.  (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes  a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including  concerns about NSA's involvement.)  Note also that NSA is specifically  charged with running the National Computer Security Center,  -- to  quote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at  the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private  sector use.''    It may or may not be a good idea to have NSA tinkering with this, but  I'm pretty sure it's legal.  (Btw -- when it comes to development of  cryptosystems, there may be two choices.  Either NSA helped develop it,  in which case maybe they can crack it, maybe not, but probably, no one  else can; or NSA didn't help, in which case they probably can crack it,  and maybe others as well...)

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or  dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or  sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of  intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting one's mind roam  freely and giving rein to one's intuition can be a useful way of coming  up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis  of the problem first.      Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something  that one learns.  Maybe we don't understand completely how it is learned,  but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the   key elements in developing it.      Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new  scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwin's naturalistic  studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the   theory of evolution.      This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes  empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal  exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation  does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical  studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very  poor kind of science.

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you   souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of   copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to   the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the   protection.    One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape   for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an   extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR   first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I   don't know if they would react or not.  Just to be safe, you might want   to make sure that you have NOTHING between the VCR and TV.    victor@inqmind.bison.mb.ca  The Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba  204 488-1607 "

While   most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who   are in ""private practice"" so to speak.  Many physicans will refer their   patients with Crohn's disease to RD's for dietary help.  If you can get   your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for   the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The   better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's   plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to   control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.  Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and   lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but   I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For   bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects   are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  Upjohn is developing   a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with   inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet.    Marty B.  "

A good vocoder like ours will give you 8000 bits per second locked at  full rate (it's a variable rate voice activity vocoder).  If you want  less quality, cut that to 4000 bps (half rate).  At full rate variable  you could put two full-duplex conversations on a V.32bis modem.  This  requires a DSP or ASICs, though.  An RS-6000 has a CPU that could  probably do it in real-time, because it has the add-and-multiply  instruction and a few other DSP things.    If you want to do speech in real-time you need about 4000 samples a  second (for not very good voice) with your 8 bit samples (ISDN is 8000  8-bit samples a second), which is 32 kbps.  You could do a fast 2:1  compression on that to get it down to 16 kbps, which is just about  V.32bis.  The quality at this point is very bleah, but it should work.  Now add in the time for your encryption method.  You're going to need  sampling hardware, which is no problem on a new Mac, an Amiga.  Or a  PC with a SoundBlaster card (just because they're so popular and cheap  - you could also build a simple ADC).  The problem with the  SoundBlaster is that it doesn't seem to be full duplex - you can't  sample and play backq at the same time, making a two-way conversation  a bit tough.  The special hardware or a more capable sound card may be  required.    The only thing that worries me is that 2:1 compression - the  SoundBlaster can do it automatically in hardware, but other than that  I don't have a good feel for how processor intensive it is, so I can't  estimate how fast a PC you'd need.      --   Not all men who drink are poets.

The focus of their intent is  his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. The  national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to  sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights  until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!  The fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their  sexual orientation. Thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights  who indulge themselves. The federal government or judiciary has the right  to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even  if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them.

1,"Nntp-Posting-Host: sdcc14.ucsd.edu          April 24th is approaching, and Armenians around the world  are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members  by the Turkish government between 1915 and 1920.        At least 1.5 Million Armenians perished during that period,  and it is important to note that those who deny that this event  ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate  the Armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in Azerbaijan,  would like to see it happen again...

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency  analyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which  means that every frequency is present in the noise signal.    Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass  filtering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much more  low-frequency components.    The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring  animals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will  explain you why.    Enjoy it.    Wouter. "

They finally realize that they need to put criminals away  longer but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun  law.( During this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how  easy criminals get off )   In the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law   will get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal)  watching him on tv just laughing his ass off.

1,"     May 13, 1993  _Five Russian soldiers sentenced to death in Azerbaijan_     MOSCOW (UPI) -- Five soldiers who served in Russia's 7th army stationed in  Armenia were sentenced to death in the Azerbaijani capital Baku Thursday for  allegedly ""carrying out diversions and killing 30 Azeri soldiers.""     A statement released by the news service of Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey  said ""the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal,"" the   Russian state news agency Itar-tass reported.     But the Russian Foreign Ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed  over to the authorities in Moscow for punishment.     ""This would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have  committed crimes,"" the statement reads.     The five men, together with another soldier who received a 15-year prison  sentence, were captured in September 1992 by Azeri police in the Kelbadzhar  district of Azerbaijan, between Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia.     The Supreme Court in Baku said the men had gone through special training in a  company of the Russian 7th army in the Armenian capital Yerevan, after which  they were sent across the Armenian-Azeri border into Nagorno-Karabakh to   carry out diversions against Azeri troops.     However, the Russian Foreign Ministry statement claimed they had deserted the  Russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with Armenian armed forces in  the battle zone round Karabakh.     Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-populated enclave within Azerbaijan which for  five years has been fighting for independence from Baku in a war that has  left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes.     Both Yerevan and Baku have always claimed that Russian servicemen stationed  in these Caucasian republics, who were left behind after the break-up of the   Soviet Union, are fighting as mercenaries in the Karabakh war.     The statement from Moscow said the Russian side repeatedly appealed to the  Azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the  six men, and to hand them over to the Russian authorities.     It said that President Boris Yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request   to his Azeri counterpart Elchibey. Itar-tass said that the soldiers' defense  attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.           --   David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | ""Armenia has not learned a lesson in  S.D.P.A.

I would  just add to Phil's very infomative discussion the following caveat: the  fifth amendment applies ONLY in crinial cases.  (""...nor shall any person .  . . be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself..."").  Thus if the father sued for custody of the children, the case would be  civil and the defendant mother would not have fifth amendment protection.  Oddly enough, her refusal to give information in a civil case can lead to  criminal contempt charges (thus landing her in jail.)  The interesting part  of all this is that in a murder trial, the woman CAN plead the fifth as   to the location of the child--this is routine.  A ""computer crime""   prosecution thus would seem to be fertile ground for this kind of defense,   where a suit by a party injured by ""hackers"" would not.  If I am accused,   for example, of sending encrypted kiddie porn over the nets the fifth should   protect my key.  If I am accused of sending copyrighted material, however,  it proabably will not (copyright infringement not being a ""crime"" in the  technical sense.)  The REALLY tricky question is, say I do both (naughty  boy that I am) can the government use the information gained in the civil  trial (ie. my key) to gain access to my files for use in the criminal  prosecution.  The answer should certainly be no, but lord only knows how  this would work out.

As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not  willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which  is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest  purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.      This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management  is accurate bookkeeping.      If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it  would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What  was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the  methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?        In an earlier article, Russell Turpin writes:      >None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should  >open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science.  >Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional  >Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the most  >part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research  >Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does  >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*  >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are  >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and  >which are not.)    First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I  don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,  homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be  accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of  homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.      What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things  (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific  attention.      If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not  use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is  effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all  of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose  methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.      It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine  those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is  also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on   those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous   fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.      But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is  capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no  ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly  be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as  doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in  reason.      --  In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems   less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.       lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet "

Is that how the mind of a compulsive liar works? The scenario and   genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in x-Soviet Armenia   is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable   similarities between the plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.     The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre:    69 year old Hatin Nine telling:    -''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told  me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''    72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:    - ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.    While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are    Turks, you must die.''    28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:    - ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of      my eyes.''    Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?  Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?    The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British  Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times  article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before  Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures  of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.    Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying  ""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the  situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu  town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's  3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...    The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of  this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.    Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability  to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.    Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print  no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the  French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag  was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''    The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots  of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human  rights violations. International reactions must be made with international  cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming  to be civilized.    Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the  right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where  is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,  journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such  as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""  Where are you?

0,"  I have been looking over the postings about the Clipper Chip and noticed  an interesting omission from the discussion.    You all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed   concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software.    The question that I have is why cant someone take one of these chips  and reverse engineer it? I mean, take the thing to a chip testing/  analysis facility, one with a decent electron microscope. Just pry  off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron  microcope and figure out the circuitry. I remembered a place that I use  to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips  that we accidently blew out while running tests. They could actually find  the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was.     I am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities  and that the potential is there, especially at a university where the  security at such a facility is looser, for someone to take a clipper  apart and analyze it?    What can the government do to prevent this? Start taking away all   microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes??    mark     "

Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from  Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about  the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy  and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell  of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my  attention.    THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?    Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:      To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July    disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,    etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,    except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3    airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with    a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something    to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.      Jay    and again:      please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet    disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would    be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and    getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a    good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't    think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are    well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One    possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.    jay         ___    _____     ___      /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov      | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |   ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand  /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and  |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

2,"       I am doing a term paper on steroids, actually the scientist who  helped crate the drug. I discovered that Joseph Fruton is one of the  researchers who helped create anabolic steroids. The only information on   this person I know is he was a biochemist that did research in the 1930's.  I already did research at my local libraries, but I still need more  information. My instructor is requiring resources from the computer  networks. Please write back concerning my subject, any books, articles,  etc., will be appreciated.   "

Vest, recently named by Vice President  Albert Gore to head the advisory committee on the redesign of the  Space Station, NASA has announced the names of representatives  from government and industry and academic experts from across the  country to participate in an independent review of the redesign  options being developed by NASA.    ""I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this  important review panel. America's future in science and  technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost  attention and care,"" said Vest. ""We have assembled a diverse  panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate  measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical  task.""    The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing  various redesign options of the space station presented by NASA's  redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve  efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program. Space  station international partners also are being asked to   participate and will be named at a later date. The advisory  committee will submit its recommendations in June.    Advisory committee members named today include:    Dr. Charles Vest              Dr. Bobby Alford  President, MIT                Executive VP & Dean of Medicine                                Baylor College of Medicine    Mr. Jay Chabrow               Dr. Paul Chu  President, JMR Associates     Director, Texas Center for                                Superconductivity                                University of Houston    Dr. Ed Crawley                Dr. John Fabian  Prof of Aero & Astro          President & CEO  MIT                           ANSER    Maj.

First, candidal overgrowth is  not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of  antibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida.

1,"  / iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /    >I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun,  >but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT?  You still haven't offered    I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even  contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife than  a gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the  same thing, then I got 'educated.'    People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how  quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that  it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick  (within a minute or so) death.    The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage  points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are  'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly  only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a  remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a  spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.    Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by  accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for  a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only  moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a  DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out  of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and  ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and  strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks  used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled  slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained  martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up  against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as  the attacker.    Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing  with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a  knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their  knife attacks in prison.    If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize  these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is  the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced  attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old  man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about  one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking  cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike  in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3  seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons  that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest  with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the  pointed end.)    Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.  Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that  destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve  seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'    This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman  in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That  lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All  four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta  girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex  of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and  destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball  sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was  out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight  months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was  on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think  civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.    The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife  attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good  alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk  (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor  them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact  weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and  is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a  caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually  do this.    Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live  and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason  'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep  us alive.    I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now  know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would  have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I  WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not  fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen  behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do  whatever it takes.    Rick. "

Beyond that, I have no other info.    The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of  the orbit of Mercury.    The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed  perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to  Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations  and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later  improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system  of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune  and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit  of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was  afoot with Mercury.    But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate  it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly  curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915  and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics  of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian   geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of  it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession  of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's  numbers rather than Leverrier's.)    Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent  efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar  have been fruitless.    -Bill Gawne     ""Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe    are the laws of the universe.""                       - G.

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this  OTC medication.  A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater  can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are  potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall  correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses  involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which  is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with  sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic  glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts  attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic  necrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the  delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver  damage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.    As to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams  of acetaminophen.  In a normal adult, this would probably  cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.

After a while we  got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -  electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last  guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400  meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters  (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt  bus.     But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a   lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would  spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those  Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the  low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with   silicone).     What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or  turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of  clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world  safer for electricans, anyway.

0,"  Clipper Chip is a response to the fact that there is no business  or professional body in a position to establish a standard and  provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission  systems.    RSA might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of  a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.    Large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they  all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.    If we, as professionals in crypto organizations, EFF, etc. were to  put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a  crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to  implement it, we might avoid government control.    Otherwise, I think it will happen to us by default.  Gov isn't probably  strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  They  are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through  the Clipper Chip.    Is RSA independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  I, for one,  would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.    If not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented  in either SW or HW and publish it, then push to make it the defacto  standard in the way that PGP and RIPEM are becoming such.    We are opposing, charging the bunker.  We should be nimble and clever.  The gov is strong, not clever.    Lew  --   Lew Glendenning		rlglende@netcom.com  ""Perspective is worth 80 IQ points.""

That doesn't worry me at all; they're not going to cheat at something  they can get caught at.  And key size is one of the things that can be  verified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the  chip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the  output.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output  bits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.    If they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that  some of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that  they only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,  DES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output  change rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think  NSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.    Remember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see  the cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased  subkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee  can and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.  This can be verified  later against the chip.  And yes, the civilian community has at least some  secure storage facilities that I don't think even NSA can get into without  it being noticed, until Fort Meade gets its transporter working again.  (Oops -- I don't think I was supposed to talk about that...)  The committee  members can even retain secure copies of the code -- in two halves, which  you have to XOR together to recover the program...    Seriously, there are, I think, problems with this whole scheme.  But the  people who invented it aren't stupid, and they've been in the crypto game  and the smoke-and-mirrors game far longer than most of us.  They're not  going to lie in ways that can be detected easily, since their credibility  is the *only* thing they can use to sell this system.  If they've lied  about the civilian committee, no one will believe them about the absence  of other back doors.  If they've lied about the key size, no one will  believe that they haven't copied the programming disk with the U keys.  If they've lied about obvious aspects of the strength of the cryptosystem,  no one will believe the escrow agencies aren't in cahoots with them.    That isn't to say that they aren't lying about all those other things  anyway.  And I'm certainly not claiming that NSA can't build a cryptosystem  with a back door that the committee can't find -- look how long it took  for folks to believe that the S-boxes weren't sabotaged.  It's entirely  possible that the committee will release an ambiguous report, for just  such reasons.  But that's a subtle point (i.e., one you can't explain to  a Senator...).    > Anyway, its looking like the  > keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA  > can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number.    I don't like the unit key generation process any better than you do.  However -- S1 and S2 are supposed to be under control of the same  escrow agents.  If they can't be trusted to keep the seed values secure,  they can't be trusted to keep the half-keys secure.    I still don't know if or when S1 and S2 change.  I thought I had seen  something about them being constant, but I just reread Denning's technical  information post, and it doesn't say anything, one way or the other.      		--Steve Bellovin "

1,"    Hi,    In Canada, any gun that enters a National Park must be sealed (I think it's a  small metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  The net result of this is  that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the  National Parks.  Instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances  of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.    I think this policy makes the users of the National Parks feel a little closer  to Nature, that they are a part of Nature and, as such, have to deal with  nature on it's own terms.    Guy "
2,"    Hello--    I just bought a new portable CD player for the office, and I notice that  it proudly proclaims ""8 TIMES OVERSAMPLING"" on the box.  Now while I think  I understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete ""samples""  exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor),  I don't understand this ""8 TIMES"" business...  It seems to me that when  I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs  said ""4 TIMES"" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting  senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take  samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't  I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording  process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate  (from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data  rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean  that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has   changed since 1983?

Excellent point, and there's a related point I'd like to make.  They'll have to back up these databases themselves, won't they?

Israel's #1 issue is ""Security"" so *any* outcomes  of ""negotiation"" certainly need to address ISREAL'S perception of this  issue.    The problem is is defining (by ""outsiders"", by Israel, and by the Arabs  themselves) what is the #1 issue to the Arab side. Is it ""Palestinian  statehood"", is it that Israel as a state should not and must not be  allowed to exist, is it that the existence of a self-governing non-  muslim ""state"" in the ""Islamic World"" is intolerable...what?

1,"   I'm writting letters to my Congresscritters and was wondering if   there is any reason(s) why I should NOT support the following   Bills, other than the previous comments about S.458.  Just checking   before I mail the letter to make sure I don't support something   that I really shouldn't.     -----------------   I strongly SUPPORT the following laws currently being considered in Congress   as they would either have a positive effect towards reducing crime, or re-   enforce our Constitutional right under the 2nd amendment.     * S. 441 (Campbell)	To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a  			mandatory minimum sentence for the unlawful possession  			of a firearm by a convicted felon, a fugitive from  			justice, a person who is addicted to, or an unlawful  			user of, a controlled substance, or a transferor or  			receiver of a stolen firearm, to increase the general  			penalty for violation of Federal firearms laws,  			and to increase the enhanced penalties provided for the   			possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of   			violence or drug trafficking crime, and for other  			purposes.     * S.458  (Smith) 	To restore the second Amendment Rights of all Americans.     * S.488  (Specter)	To provide Federal penalties for drive-by shootings.     * S.504  (Kohl)	To amend section 924 of title 18, United States Code to  			make it a Federal crime to steal a firearm or explosives  			in interstate or foreign commerce.

Even though he can act perfectly normal, he   prefers to pretend he's brain dead.     Here's a story, bout a woman named Brady, who had nothing to   do but sit around all day.  Then her husband became a media   martyr, now she wants to take all your guns away.

You make some very interesting claims here.  I'm not challenging them,  mind you, but could you provide a reference or two about the make-up  of F.B.I. personnel?

The concrete is not the problem.     Lead-acid batteries often fail from disuse (not being charged for a long  time), but there's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the  problem.    --   :-  Michael A.

1,"    From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>  Subject: Gaza and separation from Israel      Gaza and the idea of separation    The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is  presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when  the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We  were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the  Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -  currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous  statement: ""You look for me !"", i.e., I'am not making any more  efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,  Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew  or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the  Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly  MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from  residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his  government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and  peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether  they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'  perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR  government, regardless of what it does.    These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the  future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to  dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step  towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's  government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a  marginal byproduct of this ""government of peace"", which need not  disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the ""Rabinic""  policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets  and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in  the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.    But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces  itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has  lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian  workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel  Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing  to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the  Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able  to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a  fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.    Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): ""...The  liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical  separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to  understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab  workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement  designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that  their ideological support for separation only provides  'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status  quo>.    Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the  ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears  its burden. [.....].    ""Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,  humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether  this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off  responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to  thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very  easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in  Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at  the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue  all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs..."".  ------------------------------------------------------  >From The OTHER Front, Jerusalem, 10 March 1993   "

The original post claimed that the ATF/FBI was pumping napalm into the   building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  I responed  with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  It wouldn't be lit   for heating purposes because of the weather in Texas.  Everyone now claims   that it was for cooking.  Stop and think about this.  CS gas was being pumped  into the building and I presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either  bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours.  I don't know if you have ever been around CS, but I have.  Being exposed to CS  gas was part of my Army training, so I know that without a mask it VERY   uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in   the stomach.  And with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less   eat.  So my question now is ""why were they cooking food?""     I will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire.  But that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more  crazy than the ATF/FBI claim).    Michael     "

Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things  Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those  who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their  claim, and (2) those who lose.    Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen  cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.  Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the  show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that  an individual has to file a return.    Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast  the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to  people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer  for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and  so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.    Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a  claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with  the tax code.    --Tim Smith "
2,    	My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's  syndrome. Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome.    	This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for  hyperthyroidism. She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the  hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion  from it.     	I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level  but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. Her previous  endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. She entered the  hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).    I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an  abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets. .     I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia.    I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel  to New York City. For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.    Any information that might help. Apparently there hasn't been much  improvement in her condition over the past several months.     -Jackie-

2,"      ANNOUNCEMENT:	The ""HyperKnowledge"" PROJECT for NeXTSTEP    Motivation    We are a heterogeneous group of scientists and students who feel that our    work is continuously hindered by computer environments dominated by    incompatible scientific tools and monstrous software packages (too often    claiming to do everything).  Rather than being able to use different tools    together in a flexible, interactive system, we find ourselves spending too    much time converting between different data formats, writing throw-away    tools and I/O parsers, and worrying about how to get to a particular goal    rather than what it means to have attained it.    What we need is an object-oriented scientific environment where the tools    we choose to use are integrated without being parts of a closed system,    highly interactive, and extendable (both by the addition of our own    specialized objects and by combining the available tools - graphically).     The use of such an environment should be a natural extension of our work,    requiring a very short learning phase and practically no    user-documentation.  The user should feel encouraged to explore different    possibilities, testing his/her own scientific ideas without worrying too    much about whether the system is able to cope (within reason, of course).     By building an open and object-oriented system, each user should be able    to draw upon and combine those tools necessary or conducive to a    particular task: we all need to organize and archive our data, display    results, and combine information from many different sources.    Currently, the group consists of people from very different fields:    Molecular Biology, Computer Science, Physics and Astronomy, and Geography.     While many of our needs for such an environment diverge, the underlying    motivation is the same: no matter what you want to call it, we need a    system which helps rather than hinders the organization of our scientific    data and daily work.      Why NeXTSTEP?    What else is there?  No other system offers the same power, a totally    object-oriented developers environment, UNIX-compatibility,    highly-interactive and standardized user-interface.  With the advent of    NS486 and the expectation that NeXTSTEP will soon appear on a broad range    of hardware platforms, such a system will soon be nearly universally    available.  Classical workstation vendors (SUN, IBM, HP, and the rest) now    have little to offer, no similar tools exist for the standard X-Windows    GUI, if Apple had a system it would only run on their hardware, and the    mass-market Windows/DOS world is a developer's nightmare (either despite,    or more probably because of, OLE).    In order to progress, we need an open discussion of how best to develop    such an environment.  In NeXTSTEP parlance, do we simply have to put    together a set of scientific protocols and a common API for our    ""Hyper-knowledge"" servers? Should be use distributed objects?  What    minimum set of tools do we need in order to start working with the    environment?  What tool-needs do we all have in common and which ones are    best developed by specialized sub-groups?  How many already existing tools    can/should be integrated into the system (e.g. Mathematica)?  Do we need    an ""AVS""-like tool for data-flow manipulation?      Mailing list and Anonymous ftp    In order to take part to the project or to push the discussion forewords,    you are invited to subscribe to: sci-tools@embl-heidelberg.de  All (interesting) suggestions, projects and sources will be archive and    soon available (anonymous ftp).

It would relieve the  various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds  of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'm  sure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically  (not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animal  rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than  willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased  taxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident that  these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social  responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally  and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the  hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands  solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To  do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in  the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and  politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and  subsequent development and urbanization of these former private  hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any  benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.

You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians.  With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go over  all our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations or  recognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it.  By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and they  should be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish   people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians ever  showed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected   to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate   the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child.   Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To   assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings   was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom   free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.

But  I never  did anything  with them  until a  couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the  500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and  coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire  Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman  Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became  motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The  Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book  is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who  tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint  of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish  sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I  approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of  view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I  finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across  additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War  II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good  deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not  actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in  the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish  diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It  was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so  I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,  mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the  Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second  book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped  rescue Jews from the Nazis.    - How exactly did they do this?    The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents  the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period  before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in  1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi  Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and  the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of  reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were  being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new  talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three  months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey  arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and  were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish  universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical  personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors  came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political  scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in  Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the  Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,  came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics  in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the  Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually  came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other  German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.  One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical  producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to  Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the  Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul  Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first  phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by  Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in  Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded  themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in  the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I  even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey  praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting  the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been  persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the  Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The  second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in  1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and  especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They  had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of  the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the  Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was  threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews  throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might  happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled  to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their  Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the  Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of  anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not  worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot  to be a Turkish Jew.    - How so?    Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained  its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries  until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the  end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position  to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the  actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of  the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in  particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from  the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish  citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were  arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats  would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other  officials and say in effect:  ""These people are Turkish citizens.  You  can't do  this  to  them."" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be  released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish  diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.    The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.  They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion  of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and  manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they  usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.  The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps  to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded  trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and  succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews  were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in  Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish  consuls took place.    The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned  their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The  consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens  because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews  lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get  passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their  Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so  processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime  it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on  the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them  if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because  radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of  these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a  document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  ""irregular fellow  citizen."" The  document said in  effect ""This person is  a former  Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his  Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if  you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.""  The  diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on  it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they  accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this  means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who  had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.    Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of  Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to  retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these  interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all  Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to  prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz  before the Turkish consuls could do anything.    - Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?    There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War  II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the  information in this section of  the book relates to the situation  in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls  sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in  reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would  present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are  Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the  Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish  consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from  Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran  regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas  so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were  often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern  Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these  governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of  the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish  Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to  Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either  escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of  southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much  better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy  fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.  Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also  worked to rescue Jews in that country.    - The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats  acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin  from Nazi persecution.    Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their  interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their  treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German  territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.  On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not  discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis  claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not  discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.  Turkey  protested,   saying,  ""You  are  dividing   our  citizens  according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that  all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.  Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews."" American consuls  in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told  American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they  couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were  being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book  takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the  Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European  Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in  Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in  Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other  Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also  sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These  groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out  what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at  that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't  imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the  first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let  them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and  friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out  what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the  Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received  assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who  served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to  1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican  representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the  Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was  doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern  Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these  agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even  railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,  Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in  Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the  Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for  the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the  so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through  the Black Sea to Istanbul.    Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its  borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was  suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The  government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the  non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by  the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and  Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean  from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly  opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did  not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they  feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British  constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic  and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,  yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For  example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700  Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish  government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British  ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all  were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish  government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to  pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during  the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these  refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to  send money and food out of the country.    - Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be  living in Israel.    Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the  first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not  go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the  non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en  route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.    - And you have rescued it from obscurity.    Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do  not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of  the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of  whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a  much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the  picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to  undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.    When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively  small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The  rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so  significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were  murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.    About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -  translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the  story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware  of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the  people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would  not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they  could see the documents.    - What languages are used in the documents?    Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There  is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of  the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I  did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what  Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A  few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did  not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in  fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying  to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For  example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency  was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in  helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President  Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had  been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York  City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The  documents related to his mission are in English.    I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust  historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His  father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had  gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't  personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more  can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone  someday will make the effort.    - This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?    Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the  Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In  addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively  involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the  coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I  helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject  which was held in Istanbul in 1992.    - Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken  place, what do you plan to do next?    I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War  for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the  years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the  victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its  independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid  II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an  important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed  all sorts of political movements.    Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in  British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning  a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate  at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School  of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the  University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the  University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to  UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the  John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute  in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National  Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He  has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and  Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor  for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish  studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and  Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in  Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional  service activities and public lectures  in both the United States  and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited  volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2  vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or  reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,  1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire  and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York  University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation  by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the  Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry  from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan  Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A  pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in  1992.    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Papazian   asserted in 'Patriotism Perverted' that the Armenians            'lean toward Fascism and Hitlerism.'[1]    At that time, he could not have foreseen that the Armenians would  actively assume a pro-German stance and even collaborate in World  War II. His book was dealing with the Armenian genocide of the Muslim  population of Eastern Anatolia. However, extreme rightwing ideological  tendencies could be observed within the Dashnagtzoutune long before  the outbreak of the Second World War.    In 1936, for example, O. Zarmooni of the 'Tzeghagrons' was quoted  in the 'Hairenik Weekly:'     ""The race is force: it is treasure. If we follow history we shall    see that races, due to their innate force, have created the nations   and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to   the race after becoming a nation. Today Germany and Italy are   strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.   On the other hand, Russia is comparatively weak because she is   bereft of social sanctities.""[2]    [1] K. S. Papazian, 'Patriotism Perverted,' (Boston, Baikar Press     1934), Preface.

A number of Nazi Armenian leaders began submitting plans to German  officials in spring and summer 1942. One of them was Souren Begzadian  Paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the Armenian Republic in Baku.  Paikhar wrote a letter to Hitler, asking for German support to his  Armenian national socialist movement Hossank and suggesting the  creation of an Armenian SS formation in order     ""to educate the youth of liberated Armenia according to the    spirit of the Nazi ideas.""    He wanted to unite the Armenians of the already occupied territories  of the USSR in his movement and with them conquer historic Turkish  homeland. Paikhar was confined to serving the Nazis in Goebbels  Propaganda ministry as a speaker for Armenian- and French-language  radio broadcastings.[1] The Armenian-language broadcastings were  produced by yet another Nazi Armenian Viguen Chanth.[2]    [1] Patrick von zur Muhlen (Muehlen), p. 106.

The establishment of Armenian units in the German army was favored  by General Dro (the Butcher). He played an important role in the  establishment of the Armenian 'legions' without assuming any   official position. His views were represented by his men in the  respective organs. An interesting meeting took place between Dro  and Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler toward the end of 1942.  Dro discussed matters of collaboration with Himmler and after  a long conversation, asked if he could visit POW camp close to  Berlin. Himmler provided Dro with his private car.[1]     A minor problem was that some of the Soviet nationals were not  'Aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official Nazi philosophy.  As such, they were subject to German racism. However, Armenians  were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. In August   1933, Armenians had been recognized as Aryans by the Bureau of  Racial Investigation in the Ministry for Domestic Affairs.    [1] Meyer, Berkian, ibid., pp. 112-113.    Need I go on?

This is a common misconception.  There was nothing ""off the wall""  about the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number  of other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew  models, they had a wind tunnel.  In short, they were quite mainstream  and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.    I suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates?  Combs?

Anyone seen this before?    What is happening is this:  1) You turn the TV on.  2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the     high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.  3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.  4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.    Things to check:  First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical  output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most  common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn  somewhere.  Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),  if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator  then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV  In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than  that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect  inside a PC.    Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low  distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital  Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized  waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on  the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.  (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed  - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)    If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at  the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete  sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it  uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated  from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design  guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db  max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces    A evaluation kit is available.

Status: R    Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week  today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with  charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.    Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but  some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside  have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free  will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.    In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting  information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the  industry.  At times, he has claimed to ""have hardware which will blow  anything else away"", while more recently he claims they have stopped  manufacturing their own.    Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is  equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and  possibly Canon equipment.    The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to  other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,  including a young man who will identify himself only as ""Bill"" and  claims to be the ""MS-iah"".    Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak  hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work  20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were  frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of  ""interpersonal computing"" which rejects traditional roles.    Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on  federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares  throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own  apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers  carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling ""I  want to welcome you to the 'Next World' "".    - - --   Roland J.

2,"           The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and  increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still  being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER-  MONGERING ""medical"" establishment.       Some examples of very low cost NATURAL ANTI-cancer Remedies are listed in  the following article:                                NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES                                   A 3RD OPINION                             ( Some of these Remedies also work against AIDS. )                DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources             that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of             this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his             First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the             subjects of his choice.                 ( MOST of these Remedies can be found in ANY Grocery Store.              MOST of the rest of them can be found in ANY Health Food             Store.  What is important is HOW they are used, and what             else is EXCLUDED DURING their use. )                (1) THE 7-DAY FAST.                  1st day: Eat as much fresh fruit as you want, one kind             at a time, preferably grapes.                  2nd day: Eat all the vegetables you want, at least half             raw, including GARLIC; also, whole kernel corn to help scrape             clean the intestinal linings.                  3rd day: Drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice             you want.  Preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune             juice WITH PULP, followed by a gallon of pure (NOT from             concentrate) apple juice, then grape juice.  (Stay close to             your home bathroom.)                  4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and             dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS             CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                  5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from             two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and             add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).              Drink one glass per hour.            [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day             every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH             PULP.]                  6th day: Same as 5th day.                  7th day: Same as 6th day.                  All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each             day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,             plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.               (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                  Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to             8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the             six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                     (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                 Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple             cider ""flavored"" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a             glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.              Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a             week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal             healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially             effective against those types of cancer that resemble a             FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                       (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                 Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level             comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.              Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely             dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt             (regular salt won't work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                  Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising             your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your             stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,             chomping your teeth together, etc..                  Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes             the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the             book ""Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2"", by Frances Nixon, 1973.                  PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should             prepare it and drain it.            For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away             from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly             expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt             other people's fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at             least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.              (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take             a 2-Billion-bacteria ""Acidophilus"" capsule, which is also an             EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF ""A.I.D.S.""             (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the             digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune             system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal             bacteria, it may also be a CURE for ""Lyme disease"".]            Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder             storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during ""Major"" or             ""Minor Periods"" as listed in the ""Solunar Tables"" published             bimonthly in ""Field & Stream"" Magazine, (because of the             measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields             present at those times).            Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                      (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES:                           For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                  affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                  per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                  about 2 months.                            D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                  perform NORMAL cell functions.                    ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                   To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                   To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                  day.                 [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                   IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                  cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                  into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                  ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                    ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                  Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                  people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                  (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                  Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                  to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                 toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                  will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                  suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                  prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                  cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                  ""A.I.D.S."", which is really a form of cancer similar to                  leukemia.]  (See the book ""Life Extension"", by Durk                  Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                    HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                  hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                  DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                  hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                   Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                  several times per day.                 Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                  daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                  described above.                    VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                  much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                  doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                    Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                  NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                  and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                  aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                 radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                  daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                  magnetic fields.                    Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                  can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                  as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                  Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                  of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                    INTERFERON tablets.                   TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                  problems (even drug addiction!).                    50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                  prostate trouble.                    This list is NOT exhaustive.                 The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-            DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent             and cure many other medical problems including heart-            diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work             effectively.               Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these             remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send             a strong message to one's subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it             to CURE the cancer.               In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,             then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies             described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),             BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations             and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer             treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].

L.   acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily   responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of   the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L.   bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are   much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told   me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several   different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't   told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative   anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a   chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria   around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal   region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida   blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from   the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do   believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower   colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the   competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.  Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get   rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A   supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the   good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the   pH to basically starve the candida out.

2,"NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu    What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin  Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell)  getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market  price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say  $3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements  for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle   ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure  out how many, how often, where to, etc...)    Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I  know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft  designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what  the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to   eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this  portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.    And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the  intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall  street, and saying ""I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers  that show %20 ROI, fund me...)      Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that  just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace  companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things  ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS,  ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european  spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements  that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be)  ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.    Any feedback?    			John. "

In my post I was referring to your regular patrolman in a car  |cruising around the city vs. gang members.

Not that there is anything wrong with a  |revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple  |of automatics in his coat (I mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a  |disadvantage even with training.  I have been at a shooting range where gang  |gang members were ""practicing"" shooting.  They were actually practicing  |taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target  |and they weren't doing too badly either.   The University cops here (who are  |are state cops) are armed better than the Chicago police.  It seems most  |state cops are.  I don't know where you are originally from David but you live  |in Tennesse and I live in Chicago and see this crap everyday on the news  |and in the papers.  I think the situation is just a tad different here  |than there.    However, don't forget that the police in Chicago can carry just about  anything they want except for the Glock, which is not approved for  carry (Guess they figure all cops are like the Police Chief of Winnetka,  who happened to let off a stray round of 9mm. This is the same anti-gun  police chief that wanted full-auto Uzis for his patrol cars...).    Perhaps in the judgement of the majority of Chicago's finest, a close-to-  100% reliable weapon like a revolver is preferable to a 99.99% reliable  automatic. I note that in Germany, where certainly the 9mm semi-auto  handgun is king, some of the more elite police types want revolvers.    I don't think the issue is cost, because Chicago police certainly make  on the order of at least $40K/year.     Your presumption of ""disadvantage"" I think is not borne out by the  experiences of New York City's cops; there the cops usually come out  on top with their standard .38 Spl revolvers.    I've seen S&Ws, Rugers and Beretta 9mms in addition to the revolvers  carried by Chicago cops.... in the past, I've seen .45 M1911s; others  have seen Browning Hi-Powers...    |Jason "

I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are  connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the  main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground  rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of  the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot  to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.      Hmmm.

By ""almost"" I mean the differential cryptanalysis attack.  The chosen  plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts  drawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run, if I understand the  situation correctly.  This is certainly a ""break"" under the meaning of the  Act, but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch.    The rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the Skipjack  encryption algorithm E by choosing the correct data to send through it and  observe the results.  I wish him joy of it, and choose not to try that attack.    I am not defending the system, and in fact am offended by the ideas of  escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard.  However, I also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons, since that  weakens the case against it.    I said (in my private e-mail):  >> It's not clear that the ""experts"" will be told F.

No, it's quite different.  The government would have no percentage in  choosing F to be a weak key, since it's not to their advantage to have  anybody else know it.  The ""experts"" could thus assume that F is no worse  than anything else during their analysis.  Totally different situation  from unknown S-boxes.  Again, I'm not saying it would be good or  satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without  the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and  so on -- simply that I doubt that they <would> be given all the  information.  --   	Jim Gillogly  	Trewesday, 2 Thrimidge S.R. 1993, 03:01 "

The technology of cellular phones will  probably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext  without the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I  understand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.    Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The  telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule  today.    But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the  judge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext  without a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain  cellular calls and then ask a judge, ""Hey, can we have permission to  listen to those tapes?"" can they?    >worse, of course, if the government then uses this ""Clinton Clipper""  >to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption. (This is the main  >concern of most of us, I think.

They don't even  have to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the  really smart crooks anyway.

They like this enough that they are dropping the so  called ""Digital Telephony"" proposal, according to rumours.  However the  meaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext  on telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.  --   Brad Templeton, ClariNet Communications Corp. -- Sunnyvale, CA 408/296-0366 "
2,"    Hi all,    I really thought that by now I would have seen something  about this, but I haven't, so here goes:  Last night on  the evening news, the anchorperson said something to the  effect that one of the SSRBs that was recovered after the  recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of  some sort rattling around apparently inside the case.  There  was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was  found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson  did say something about a NASA official commenting that  there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.    Has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be   better than mine heard anything about this?  It seems rather  weird.    Mitch ---------------------------->jmcocker@eos.ncsu.edu "

1,"  Much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the  BD compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly  crushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the  compound. If the the propane tank is flattened and has tread marks on it,  then the BD's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be  verified.    --   Dave Feustel N9MYI <feustel@netcom.com>    The U.S. Government has become a garrotte around the necks of its  citizens.

2,"  In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review  section there was a report of a group called ""Space Marketing""  in Atlanta, Georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide  reflective Earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large  and as bright as the Moon and carry some sort of advertising.  There was an editorial about this in the Times the following  Tuesday.    Are others as upset about this as I am?  I feel that a global  boycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good  idea.  Perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries  around the world?

Not in gamma rays, though.  You'd hafta get  all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction  of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic   (but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think  of how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up.    Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.

The criminal acts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government come directly  under the scope of the Convention on Genocide adopted by the General   Assembly of the United Nations on December 8, 1948, containing the   following provisions:    The Contracting Parties, having considered the declaration made   by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution  95 (1) dated December 11, 1946, that genocide is a crime under  international law, contrary to the spirit and aims of the United  Nations and condemned by the civilized world;    Recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted  great losses on humanity; and    Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such odious  scourge, international cooperation is required;    Members agree as hereinafter provided:    Article 1. The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether  committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under   international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.    Article 2. In the present Convention genocide means any of the  following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or  in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as   such:    A) Killing member of the group;  B) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;  C) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life      calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole      or in part;  D) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;  E) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group;    Article 3. The following acts shall be punishable:    a) Genocide  b) Conspiracy to commit genocide  c) Direct and public incitement to commit genocide  d) Attempt to commit genocide.    Article 4. Persons committing genocide or any of the other acts  enumerated in Article 3 shall be punished, whether they are  constitutionally responsible rulers, public officials or private  individuals.    Had the Convention on Genocide existed before the Armenian   massacres of the Turks and Kurds, it would probably have been   difficult for the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its responsibles  to start murdering of civilian, defenseless, faithful Ottoman  citizens, children and women, (GENOCIDE AND ATTEMPT TO GENOCIDE),  to make plans to exterminate, as they have done also to Urartus  and Jews, faithful Ottoman citizens (CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT GENOCIDE),   to incite Armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority  and to commit Genocide, (DIRECT AND PUBLIC INCITEMENT TO COMMIT  GENOCIDE).

You'd need to launch HLVs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume  no new launcher development.  If you assume new launcher development, with  lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to  build something HLV-sized anyway.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically      reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.    For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical      Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from   chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate  8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second   6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the      women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection   were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.       The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.    It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The     researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some      brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus           thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used    in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a           protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to    try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists       acidophilus in its contents.                                              --- end ---                                                    ===================================    InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92    THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED    ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS    MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

Can it be that  criminal/Nazi Armenians of ASALA/SDPA/ARF hate Muslims for ideological   reasons regardless of what they do? Between 1914 and 1920, your criminal  Armenian grandparents committed unheard-of crimes, resorted to all   conceivable methods of despotism, organized massacres, poured petrol   over babies and burned them, raped women and girls in front of their   parents who were bound hand and foot, took girls from their mothers   and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate. And   today, they put Azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other   nation had ever known in history.                                     Source: The Times, 2 March 1992    CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH    ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES   TO INVESTIGATE THE MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...    As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw   the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as   they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to   journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts   of the hills.    The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING   of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians   last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death   or missing...     Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter   as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there   was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer   ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We   swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon   under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.    We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round   again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a   valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung   round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired   repeated blasts.    Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting   had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed   enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in   fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.   I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,   its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on   ""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a   search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.    Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two   M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed   flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second   crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains   and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters   were there to give covering fire if necessary.    The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet   armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani   official told us that there were now five former Soviet military   helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have   signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged   in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian   pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.    We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an   heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer   white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four   corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an   Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies   on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back   towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before   the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.    Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the   civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were   covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor   mortis. They had been shot.    What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,   and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh?

1,"Message-ID: <1ra7f7INNc74@dns1.NMSU.Edu>  NNTP-Posting-Host: kazak.nmsu.edu  X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL9]      The Colorado Daily recently reprinted the Wall Street Journal's article  on Paxton Quigley, including the nefarious little paragraph the Journal  tacked onto the end.  After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.  type folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,  and surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.  The Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student  (I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...    (The title was the only thing they changed/added)    ""Gun Stats""    The Daily recently reprinted an article from the  Wall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton  Quigley, author of ""Armed and Female.""  The article,  in turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally  reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The  article states, ""A study... found that a gun in the home  was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,  spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.""  This  is an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-  eral reasons, outlined below:    The study gives the impression that, if you own a   gun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to   defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned  against you.  The study, however, fails to take into  account cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun   to thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-  trator.    The study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather  than 'friend'.  This would include the friendly neigh-  borhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every  month, the second your grandmother cashes her social  security check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a  friend.    The NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-  position of cases and fails to take into account cases  originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be  self-defense.  Especially considering the small sample   size (396), taking these events into account has a sub-  stantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.    Criminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-  erent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be   used, successfully, by a private citizen against an   aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-  sons defending themselves from aggression by using a   gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by  some other means, or who offer no resistance at all.  Statistics available from the FBI and other agencies   also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be  used by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat  than to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times  more likely to be used to defend against a criminal  threat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times  more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be  used to commit suicide.    It is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can   be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has  to consider carefully what questions were asked by  those gathering the data before one can draw an accu-  rate conclusion from them.    D.F.

2,"  As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous  question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume  that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.    She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it  and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she   believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.    (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the  idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the   food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG  be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit  forming) ?    This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my  children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet  food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other  brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some  sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net, are:  Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?  Is it allowed for pet  food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  Is MSG put in   pet food?    -----------------------------------  I speak for myself and not Motorola  -----------------------------------     --   Walter Lundby   "

They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).  Oops, that is not a recognized ""illness"" in the psychological community,  better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)    Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians  will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,  just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general  population, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among  physicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -  any help here a.p.p.er's?)    One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious  choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to  control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are  also extroverted, they are best described as ""Field Marshalls"".  This trait  is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to  lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,  to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and  technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-  minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types  and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,  when the NT person has self-image challenges, the ""dark-side"" of this  personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.    A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their  temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),  and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient  must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've  known many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them  with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they  usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an  extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).    Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)    Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.      >Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have   >no idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that   >balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Of course, I believe that I have  been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being  the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people  myself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion  above the level of anal effluent.      >...Humans have all   >kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small   >and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this   >happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.    In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune  stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses  were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.  I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks  of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial  infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the  details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this  diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the  difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed  a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you  understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal  therapy below).      The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor  mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being  considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween  infection.      >Steve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals   >and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what   >vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling   >Elaine's doctor a quack.    I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after  my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then  dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received  zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly  complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular  specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,  he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)  supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.  Call me carrot face.  :^)    Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to  all supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for  example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had  good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order  improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is  not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.      >survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides   >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In     Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that  I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my  sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that  demonstrate candida ""blooms"" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation  (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one  week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this  time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on  Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered  normal).    BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't  remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's  which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)  aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus  inflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it  is relevant to this discussion.      >some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus   >membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to   >the candida or not isn't certain.    My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic  response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.  Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test  is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow  part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a   threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to  Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane  irritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,  one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a   Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.    BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, ""Sinus Survival"",  has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic  anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic  sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in  the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over  90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it  doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection  is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that  nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.    This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is  aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway  into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by  direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,  lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who  has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start  with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.      >If it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty   >nondescript.      This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny  and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the  appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture  the yeast ""bloom"" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or  even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually  impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot  be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.    It's a real Catch-22.    Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that  no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not  up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which  should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should  be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to  convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,  you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to  compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study  needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get  funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the  smaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other  doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes  into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get  nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.    It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have  *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to  noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable  hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence  to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would  also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue -   excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will  not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold  such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...      >Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in   >the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the   >vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the  sinus mucus membranes and cilia?      >While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the  most common cause of   >this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which   >knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main   >competition for candida as far as food is concerned.

Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus  species can grow hyphae (""roots"") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing  in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but  you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic  anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such  as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has  been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in  e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-  term treatment of GI tract ""candidiasis"".  It's like trying to weed a garden  by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come  out again once you walk away.    The $60000 question is whether a contained candida ""bloom"" can partially  grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms  in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming ""systemic"" in the  classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive  bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that  is potentially lethal.      >In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good   >reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very   >favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and   >humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system  that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt  alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.  For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live  with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention  surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not  get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and  fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and  equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly  improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.  Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have  improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the  experience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to ""live with  it"".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total ""cure"".  The  anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction  because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those  having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.  Be sure to get the revised edition.)      >...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic   >GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his   >patients is a non-existent syndrome.    Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his  visits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said ""you'll just have  to live with it"".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and  non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now  shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road  to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a  systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of  anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own  practice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-  ""yeast hypothesis"" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,  ""it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases"", to put it mildly.  I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating  their moral obligations to help the patient.    Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are  confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the ""hypothetical  yeast overgrowth"" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people  have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues  have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -  you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does  something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a  thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?  Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works  instead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become  so enamored with ""scientific correctness"" that they are ignoring the patients  they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which  we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when  you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach  (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having  exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional  medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I  went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,  and as a result I have found significant relief.    Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up  some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having  his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)  therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the  accepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:  ""well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this  country, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority  to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I  can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign  something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of  these unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State  Board.""  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this  pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic  reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much  risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the  patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,  and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would  be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the  compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything  it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism  that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of  which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all  (true quackery).

Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to   purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be  one of the following:  a) An employee of a government agency.  b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.  c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in  research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations:   The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.  Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction  and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.    The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any   organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions   to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:  - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the  location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.   - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft  within the operating radius around the launch site.  - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.  - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that  unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.    Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)  are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the  western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular  since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).    The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'  use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is  from 50 to 500 or more feet.     By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from  most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart  C, for details.    As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to  50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical  rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,  or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry  either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches  in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.    Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.    >And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.    Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets  for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything  bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to  practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs  takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.    >-Paul ""mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite"" Dokas    That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE  ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest  misconceptions people have about our hobby.     >/*            Just remember, you *WILL* die someday.             */  True. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get   hit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand.   --   Mark Johnson                          USnail: NCR Peripheral Products Division  E-mail:  Mark.Johnson@WichitaKS.NCR.COM       3718 N.

2,"  Try the folks at Dimolex Corp., La Crescenta, CA 91214.  Their number is (818) 957-7001.  They make membrane keypads  that are very flat, in layouts from 2 to 128 keys.  They  have standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes  under each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as  backlit models.  Some of them can even be cut with scissors  to form a funky shape other than a rectangle.  Many of the  models are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel,  colored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to make  your own layout.  One piece prices aren't cheap, though,  as they want $10 for one four position pad *kit*, and $45  for a 40 position *kit*.    I have no affiliation with Dimolex or any company connected  with them.  I *have* purchased a couple of keypads from them,  and am pleased with what I got.    Cheers,  Alan  <acooney@netcom.com>   "

Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages  count as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them?  January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold                 1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,                      after cutting off the supply lines to it.  Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi.  By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from        land links with the rest of the Jewish population.           The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,              while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were              slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.  Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from       Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side       of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews        had been killed.    Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.  Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets  against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?

The paper  describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve  aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems  associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed  airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane     The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the  paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000  pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and  life support.  System design reliability is .9995.     Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets  and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-  long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-  stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy  payload on an expendable second stage.     To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a  normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,  modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,  would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing  out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like  aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.     Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff  is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.  The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs  of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust  rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,  with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-  25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would  be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's  success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact  tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.       The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude  while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,  cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater  safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle  and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major  use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-  ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide  as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical  configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can  be shown to be operationally viable.""      >Is this really news? Does this threaten further work on DC-?     Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for  some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL  SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-  examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.     Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going  studies trying straighten out the government's future space  transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)  are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are  various factions and options vying for attention -- including  shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3""  architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced  vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,  etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy  for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to  juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against  medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against  the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies  like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.     It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't  that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens  of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in  the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a  final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.   ------------------------------------------------------------------   Wales Larrison                           Space Technology Investor        --- Maximus 2.01wb "

1,"    REFLECTIONS ON BOSNIA    LORD OWEN AND THE SERBS    In early February '93, Lord Owen made appearances in New York City  on the Donahue and Charlie Rose shows. On a couple of occasions on  those shows Lord Owen gave away his pro-Serbian position when he  made the point that much or most of the Bosnian territory then in  dispute or already overrun by Serbian forces had been controlled  and occupied by Serbs before WWII.  It was as if he were saying  that since the Serbs had previously occupied those territories and  lost them during the Hitler years, they should be allowed to  reconquer them today.    I was familiar with this view because my father, a Yugoslav Jew  who escaped to this country during the war, was aided and found  sympathy among the Serbs during those harrowing years.  In recent  months when the subject of Serbian aggression was mentioned, my  father would make the point that 850,000 Serbs were killed by Nazi  and pro-Nazi Croatian forces known as the Ustasha.  My father is  so pro-Serbian that he dismissed reports of Serbian atrocities. My  father also excoriated New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis,  because, my father said, Anthony Lewis ""is always talking about  the Muslims.""    Update--April 28, 1993 After an uneasy truce in and around  Sbernica, shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and  the killing and the misery continues apace while the Clinton  administration dithers its response.  In the days leading to the  collapse of resistance at Sbernica, Lord Owen changed his tune.  Previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds  that it would endanger U.N. relief workers. When Serbian forces  began to march on Sbernica, the threat to U.N. relief soldiers  went unmentioned while Lord Owen called for outside intervention  to stop Serbian aggression, including the use of air strikes.  The  current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the West  and a failure of the Vance-Owen initiative which did nothing to  halt the Serbs. Now that it's too late to save Muslim areas that  Lord Owen felt should be in a Muslim state, Lord Owen belatedly  calls for strong action.    CLINTON AND BOSNIA    In the summer of 1992, George Kenney, a senior State Department  official, the undersecretary in charge of the Yugoslav desk, made  news when he resigned from the State Department because of the  Bush administration's refusal to take any action to halt Serbian  aggression.  As Kenney saw it, Bush's inaction was largely due to  the president's unwillingness to risk any political capital by  getting involved there.    Apparently the same is true of the Clinton administration.  Clinton gives the impression that he cares more than Bush did  about the terrible ongoing tragedy, but the practical effect has  so far been the same.    According to the New York Times, (4/16/93) the Clinton  administration did everything it could to suppress a mid-March  report by its own experts which called for military action if  necessary to protect ""safe havens"" for the Muslims. At one point,  Senate majority leader, George Mitchell was so incensed that the  report was kept from Congress, that he called for an  investigation.    Instead of helping the desperate Bosnians, Clinton has signalled  again and again that Milosevic and the Serbs are free to do what  they want in Bosnia--indeed, Clinton and the West have been  signalling that the Serbs should get on with the job and finish  off the Bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other  way.  A key signal was when Clinton made it clear that he would  NOT send in American military forces on the ground.  On this  issue, Clinton has made me wistful for Bush.  Bush and Baker could  not have done worse, and might have been pressured to do better  well before this time.  Lives in Bosnia might have been saved and  the destruction might have been curtailed..    The Nation, the left and ""the Bosnian QUANDARY""    Typical of the left's inability to come to grips with the core  issue involved in Bosnia, i.e., a clear aggressor destroying  hundreds of thousands of lives, is the editorial on the ""Bosnian  quandary"" in The Nation (4/26/93).  In the end the editorial votes  to do nothing, even while noticing ""the ghastly atrocities of the  Bosnian Serbs""  and that the ""greater and lesser powers...dither  and fuss [and] hang back."" (""Before anything else happens, the  Clinton Administration ought to pay the $530 million the United  States owes the"" U.N. the editorial concludes.)    In its most striking passage, the editorial writer warns that  ""those who are pushing President Clinton to intervene on the side  of the Bosnians had better review U.S. foreign policy since World  War II.""  The editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the  Bosnian Serbs are no worse than any number of U.S. clients  including the Chileans, the South Africans, the Greek fascists and  others. (In a subsequent column for The Nation, Christopher  Hitchens correctly called this editorial, ""contemptible."")    ***    William Pfaff, a European based journalist who writes for the The  New Yorker and the Los Angeles Times, is among a group of liberal  columnists like Anthony Lewis, and Leslie Gelb who have clearly  and consistently called for strong Western and American  intervention to stop the Serbs.  Pfaff's most recent column  (Liberal Opinion Week 4/19/93) is entitled ""International  Cowardice Worsened Bosnian Tragedy.""    He clarifies the international failure which has led to present  situation in one sentence. ""Having refused to intervene to  sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent  Croatia in June 1991, or to block or penalize the military  aggression by Serbia that immediately followed, and the atrocious  ""ethnic cleansing"" which followed that, the United Nations now  contemplates deploying in Bosnia military force on a scale which  two years ago could have deterred the horrors Yugoslavia has since  experienced.""  He goes on to explain that U.N. plans now envisaged  call for a ""more daunting and open-ended military assignment than  a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have  been a year ago.""    Aryeh Neier on the Serbs In his ""Watching Rights"" column in the  The Nation (5/3/93) Aryeh Neier gets to the heart of the  motivation of the ""aggressors""--the preferred term for the Serbian  forces who have been besieging and shelling Sarajevo for more than  a year.  He explains that ""there is no  military purpose that is  served by the destruction of its fabric and its people...Above  all, few of those aligned with the forces attacking Sarajevo would  want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt.  They are  not city people.    ""It is this, I believe--aside from a desire to break the morale of  Bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at  any price--that explains the conduct of the siege of  Sarajevo...[I]t is a loathing for all that is urban, pluralist and  cosmopolitan that has made Sarajevo the object for devastation.    ""Historically, most of the Serbian population in Bosnia and  Herzegovina has been rural, while Muslims, who were the civil  servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of Ottoman rule,  made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....The  destruction of Sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility  against this city; it is also an attack on the urban idea....The  demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war  exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred  for all that is cosmopolitan.""    The light that Neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is  at stake.  The Serbs represent the know-nothing, anti-secularist,  fundamentalist, fascist forces who are attacking the urban,  cosmopolitan, secular, multi-cultural idea.  They are attacking  the rest of us, just as Hitler did. One irony is that at the  beginning of the crisis over Bosnia, it was for awhile maintained  by the Serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a  threat by the Bosnian Muslims to create a fundamentalist state.    Neier has shown that it is the Serbs who are  the great threat to  secularism, multi-culturalism, diversity and democracy.  It's the  Serbs who are attacking the democratic notion, the democratic  idea.    Anthony Lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does  respect for Clinton's presidency ""depend...on his acting  effectively against Serbian aggression?...First of all because to  do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values  we and our allies profess.""  (Times, 4/26/93) But it's not merely  a betrayal of our values.  It's because the Serbs are attacking us  by proxy, just as Hitler was.    One argument for decisive action by the West that is heard in a  different form, is that war in the Balkans is destablizing for  Europe.  We hear it as, the Bosnians are Europe's Palestinians;  that is to say, just as the Palestinian refugee problem has been  the key to instability in the Middle East, just so will the  hundreds of thousands of Yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities  result in turmoil in Europe for decades to come.    One of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though  the Atlantic Ocean divides us, the Americas are ultimately tied to  the destiny of Europe. If Europe is destabilized, the U.S. will  inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems.  As in a  whirlpool,  sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.  And as past history and Pfaff have shown, it's much better if we  do so decisively, quickly and on our terms.    Sincerely, Ronald Bleier   "

Could  > someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?    The name is rather descriptive.  It's a command to the spacecraft that tells  it ""If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong  with your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode  in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth.""    The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other.  Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,  there's no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft's  point of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything is  fine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how long  should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and  begins to take corrective action?  That ""how long"" is the command loss timer.  During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set  to rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo ""expect to  hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours"". "

Things might have gone very differently if the BATF  _had_ ""rung the doorbell"".    >The paranoid assertion that the BATF fired first in an unprovoked  >assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish.

This is stupid.  That is no paranoid assertion, it is testamony from surviving  witnesses, and the BATF _has_ no tanks, nor am I aware of either the BATF _or_  the FBI using any until yesterday.  When they use maximum force they do just  what they did that first day that got four officers killed.    >The stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by  >ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.

Phil, I've been reading your postings for months and I'm convinced that you  will back anything, no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone  else's rights if you think it will hurt people you don't like.  It's people  with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the Holocaust, a process  that is in place _now_ in this country, even if the tattered, pitiful remains  of the Constitution is slowing its progress.  This isn't a Libertarian issue,  others may argue that line, but from a strictly Constitutional view of a  democratic gov't, what the FBI and BATF did was wrong, wrong, wrong, even if  their _reasons_ for trying to arrest Koresh were 100% right.  _Anything_ that  leads to the deaths of 17 children, if nothing else touches your stoney  heart, is _wrong_ no matter who pushed the button.

Compared to what most criminals use, a  9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely  rare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&R magnum with  ""civie"" bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (and  the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.    What if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizen  alone?

The trap is the easy way out.  	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the  demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,  and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You're  going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic  group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors  leading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than  not, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.  	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few  Blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crime  statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then  worry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable  or whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to  define ""us"" and ""other"" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous  when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational  humans.  	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the  *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racial  makeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live in  San Francisco, a city that loves to tout its ""ethnic diversity"". Here, we  have Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the ""model minority"") gangs,  and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly  troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their  propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on  the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and  crime are what they most fear. During the ""disturbance"" in Los Angeles last  year many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I  remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs  where there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned  from TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives  that live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first truly  multi-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that  in the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*  riot!  	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting points  that really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the  racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As  a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem  becomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly  believe that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current  course of denial and repression.  	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,  luck in avoiding the ""trap"".

1,"  OK... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you  know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.  You see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed  individuals are rushing your front door.  Will you a) defend yourself and family  against this attack b) realize ""oh, only the BATF would enter like that, so I   better surrender"" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do  what they would like?  You have chosen a), and discover that the people you   defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your  door waiting for you to surrender.  You have learned that they intend to   charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that  you can safely surrender at any time.  Then they start using psychological   warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up  and will receive a fair trial.  Some weeks into this standoff, you are still  holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using  tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  Yet they claim that  you can safely surrender at any time.  While you patiently wait out this latest  round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as  cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through  the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created  by the tanks.  Only 9 of your followers make it.    I am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  I am disagreeing with  the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to   surrender to agents of the Federal government after another federal agency  committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted  search warrant.      Look at how the Texas Rangers view the BATF.  Look at the FBI statements  regarding the BATF actions.  From all apparent sources, the FBI blundered  trying to clean up the mess made by the BATF, resulting in an accidental fire  which killed most of the BD's who were still in the compound, and are now   playing CYA.  The BATF committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of   Texas NG resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses  by accusing the BD's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been  held off in their assault.    --   ********************************************************************************  James S.

(This is also  >covered in the above reference.)    No more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so  the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk-heat the remainder.    Two  years ago this month my house and office burned.  In my office was my  reloading bench.  On the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was   about 100 lbs of smokeless powder, 5 lbs of black powder, several thousand  primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds, primarily in .45ACP, .30-20  and .308.  The fire was extinguished before the area containing the   reloading supplies were fully involved.  There was about 1/2"" of char on  the joists, subsequently removed by sandblasting.  Lots of heat in other  words.    None of the powder kegs ignited.  One 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.  No explosion, as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.  The black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids  completely melted and ran down inside.  The smokless powder was  contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs.  The kegs were charred  badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case  of the metal cans, the plastic lids melted completely away.    Many of the rounds cooked off.  They were in close proximity to wood  on all sides so the effects were easy to observe.  In most cases with the  rifle ammo, the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle.  Many bullets were  found still in the neck.  Small shards of brass were lightly stuck into   the wood.  Lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually  dislodge them.  Primers generally popped out of the primer pockets.  The .45ACP rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.  No dents were observed above the storage area, indicating the bullets  left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard.    Ordinary small arms ammo is NOT a hazard when cooking off regardless  of what the FBI says.      John    --   John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

Therefore, ""the right   >of the people to keep and bear Arms"" gives legal power to the ""well   >regualated militia"" and this legal power ""shall not be infringed"".      Ah, clarification by obfuscation.    Actually, the words ""A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the  security of a free state"" is a present participle, used as an  adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of  the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It  asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for  maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or  state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other  than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a  right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,  Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.  The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the  amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right  to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of  a free state.  In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and  bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.      >So in effort not to force my views and not ""to destory our Liberties and  >Rights,""  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in  >the matter of ""Liberties and Rights"" is the final word.

1,"  	A few things about the University. It is more fun than some may  admit. Partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked  one of Playboy's top party schools. But we do study and more  importantly learn a lot. The overall UVa drug use is actually  lower than the average college in the U.S.   	There is no hate law on the books even though they (The  forces of PC) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar  law at the University of Wisconsin ? was found unconstitutional  last year). There is a law  against relationship of professors with their students or  advisees that just passed.   	Thomas Jefferson was the sole author of the Virginia  statute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten  amendments), though he is not given full credit for righting  the bill of rights. So someone who picked on me for that is  right.   	By the way, we're the man in everything. Sports  academics and partying. I'm sure a lot of other schools are  good at what they do as well, so don't start mailing me junk.  I'm happy where I am and maybe I'll go to one of y'alls medical  schools in a couple of years. "

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking  anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea  of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,  additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are  not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that  in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.     Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in  some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use  that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have  when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested  by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because  long-term effects, if any, are not known?

Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,  biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic  persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular  carcinoma.    Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of  a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be  determined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It  consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting  plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast  to chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation,   bridging necrosis, or fibrosis.     CPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and  CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed  out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have  it. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing  areas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe  it is a continuum. I don't know.    =================================    Howard Doyle  doyle+@pitt.edu     "
2,"Message-ID: <1qn4bgINN4s7@mimi.UU.NET>  NNTP-Posting-Host: mimi.uu.net        Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It  would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.  The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to  ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main  spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer  momentum to the ship.      Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion  heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave  into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are  going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,  helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic  radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission  products).      Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much  momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems  to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs  out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once  they're there.      I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?      Thanks.    --   	--Jim    ---  Jim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltz@uunet.uu.net "

History shows that within the last 170 years, Greeks played   that game twice: They used Istanbul Patriarch Grigorios in 1822 to   instigate the Morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of   the Muslim people.

Shaw, 'The Jews of the Ottoman Empire and the          Turkish Republic,' New York University Press, New York (1991).     pages 202-203:      <<In 1865, immediately after enactment of the new Organic Statute for the    Jewish community, and just as Jewish capital from Europe was beginning    to have an effect in Istanbul, local Armenians and Greeks started a pogrom    against Jews immediately across the sea of Marmara at Haydarpasa, terminus    of the Anatolia railroad, with three hundred Jews massacred and many more    beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the Sultan sent    his personal guard across the bay to protect the Jews [39].      In later years, ritual murder attacks against Jews, carried out mostly    by native Greeks, Armenians, and, in Arab provinces, by Maronites and    other Arab Christians, often with the assistance of the local European    consuls, took place throughout the empire. There were literally thousands    of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far    west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and    the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south    as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These    invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians    by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian    financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of    the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian    massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting    in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops    and homes.      Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of    Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt    and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases    with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose    Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the    rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of    instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread    their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where    their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes    such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled    them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with    little question or opposition.      On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British    High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David    and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:        ''Sir,          I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which        has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which        contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,        especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.        Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,        Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison        the people's minds with exaggeration and painted words? In an article,        he asserted that the Jews use Christian blood for Passover, of course        this has caused a deal of excitement.'' [40]      Whenever Greek and other Orthodox religious authorities or prominent    Greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence    or reduce tension, they invariably indicated their cooperation and then    failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated    or led them.

The  distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people  whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these  soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And  resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich  were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).  Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by  resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the  Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the  hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the  Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the  only option they see as viable.

TEMPEST is a codeword for a standard, shared between the NATO governments, to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. The limits set in the   standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect   that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be   exploited. It is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic   field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.    Among other things, I drive a 1987 Korean built AT clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. The major source of unintentional emission is the CRT. To that can be added the video driver card, the RS232 parallel cable and the   printer head. The emissions from these are gross can be detected with the   crudest of equipment. Were I to apply good test equipment and some   intelligence to measuring emission levels, I would find many other potential   sources of leaked information.    Where cryptography is used for serious purposes, poor TEMPEST protection   becomes an important security hazard.    In the early eighties, the need to allow some commercial concerns,   particularly financial institutions, a level of protection against TEMPEST   threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the   'release' of a cut-down TEMPEST stansard for commercial use. I say 'release'   for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to   approved customers) AFAIK even the commercial standard remains classified. If  you think about it, it would really have to wouldn't it?        --                                    -= Owen Lewis =-                                        @        Tele/fax  +44-(0)794-301731   ELOKA   Consultancy & Project Management                              oml@eloka.demon.co.uk                          pgp 2.x public key on request "

2,"  Hello,  I am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this  question, however, Here I go..  I am a commercial fisherman and I   fell about 3 weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or  cracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left arm.    My question,  I have been to a doctor and was told that it was   best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect, and   indeed I am about 60 % better, however, the work I do is very   hard and I am still not able to go back to work.  The thing that worries me  is the movement or ""clunking"" I feel and hear back there when I move   certain ways...  I heard some one talking about the rib they broke   years ago and that it still bothers them.ÿ.  any opinions?  thanx and cheers               jc@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (John Cross)       The Old Frog's Almanac  (Home of The Almanac UNIX Users Group)      (604) 245-3205 (v32)    <Public Access UseNet>    (604) 245-4366 (2400x4)          Vancouver Island, British Columbia    Waffle XENIX 1.64   "

First, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of  penetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter.  Unless that  expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice ""pop"" and not  enough threat for even firefighters to worry about.  Finally, it's  rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to  a crisp.  See, by the time the ammunition went up those people were  quite dead.  Look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising.    	However, it's my contention that it makes little difference  whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the Feds seem  to have shared responsibility for both.    < Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >  <  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

No. The LAPD officers were tried first by the State of California  on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the Federal Government  on depriving RK of his civil rights - a different crime.        The scenario I outline is more similar to the Oliver North trial.  Ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the US) during Senate  hearings, under immunity. The team which was later to prosecute him on  criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of ON's  immunized testimony. ON's lawyer brought up the probability that at  least someone on the team had heard about the Senate testimony, and it  was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the  reasons this ON is still walking around free today.

2,"NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu        Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter  than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big  presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more  bare-bones.    In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would  hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,  maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it  in.    After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written  questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only  had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.    So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question  being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.  Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all  the difference.    So, on to the substance. The question was     Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such  as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete  with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed  by Mcdonnell Douglass?    Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,  then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last  part first.    This is to the best of my recollection what he said.    As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better  answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers   about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High  speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at  this point.    So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial  arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that   they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them  to persue work on their own.    Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,  this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this  guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space  lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where  the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman  of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are  trying to do something with it.      Anybody know anything further?  Is this really news?  Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?                        John. "

Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco   authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how   operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and   infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,   right-wing and what they called ""pinko"" organizations.      Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known   organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting   anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking   any laws.      Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to   gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los   Angeles and San Francisco.      Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political   spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan   Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the   Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish   Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of   directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San   Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.      People who were subjects of the spy operation included former   Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.   LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who   is based in South Africa.      Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was   confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement   agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and   organizations was sold separately to the South African government.      In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from   police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony   counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West   Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify   the search warrant.      The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than   25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.   Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in   San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation   Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax   attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not   be reached for comment, his office said.      Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a   panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial   recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a   former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.      The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied   repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.   League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an   employee and have said they simply traded information with police   departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.      But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,   San Francisco police alleged that ""ADL employees were apparently less   than truthful"" in providing information during an earlier search   conducted without a warrant.      David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said   the organization has not violated the law.  ""There is nothing   nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,"" he said.  ""Our   record speaks for itself.""      The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret   fund used to pay for ""fact-finding operations.""  Lehrer, according to   the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.   Patterson.      An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to   a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending   them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.      Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for   nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with   San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many   sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as   ""Skins"" and ""Pinkos,"" but that did not necessarily mean that they were   under surveillance.      ""I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,"" Bullock said.   ""And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a   threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,   say, 'Pinko.'""      In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police   Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he   was questioned by the FBI in the case.      A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records   and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,   vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license   photographs.      Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and   Bullock also provided information to the South African government,   receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.      The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the   South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss   nature of the spy operation.      The file notes that Kraft's articles ""appear frequently in The Times   and are well researched and written,"" but little else about the file   is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another   Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong   Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal   information.      Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how   Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from   skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash   of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his   own paid informants under code names such as ""Scott"" and ""Scumbag.""      He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,   exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,   including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.      It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying   on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African   government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an   agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the   probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The   Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather   information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,   Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and   investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league   offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of   San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax   Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to   cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los   Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that   some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may   have come from Los Angeles police officers.            From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.      ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION      By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.      SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a   civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities   who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential   police information on citizens and groups.      But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation   League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many   felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax   violations and conspiracy.      Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful   about its spying operations, which collected information on more than   12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political   spectrum.      Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show   that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept   files on political figures.      Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down   its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when   deciding what charges to file.      In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.   Foxman described the ADL as ""a Jewish defense agency which has fought   to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80   years.""      Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on   extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing   information to police, journalists, academics, government officials   and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain   information illegally, he said.      ""Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and   physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or   identity of any source of information,"" Foxman said.      The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its   longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than ""a private   individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'""      Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements   showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through   Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.      ""Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be   distanced from ADL,"" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.   Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.      Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate   with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn   over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's   offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.      A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,   produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial   transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it   will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.      ""The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,""   the district attorney said.   --   Yigal Arens   USC/ISI                                                TV made me do it!   arens@isi.edu  js   "

Hope he/she doesnt mind.      By Lance Gay, Scripps-Howard News Service     SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- In this land of historic hatreds, a tiny  Jewish community is braving Serbian shells to repay a 50-year-old debt to  Muslims who saved Jews from the Holocaust.     Ivica Ceresnjes, president of the Jewish Community of Sarajevo, says he  and about 1,000 other Jews chose to remain in Sarajevo, rather than leave  for Israel, to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district  running.     Ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the Muslims who hid Jews during  the Nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries-old presence of   Jews living in Sarajevo.     ``Some with guns are defending Bosnia, but I fight in Bosnia by keeping   people alive,'' Ceresnjes said.     As a student of Balkan history, Ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and   had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. A year before the war  erupted here last April, Ceresnjes said the Jewish center began  stockpiling supplies, ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for  places in Israel and Europe for the evacuees.     They were so well prepared, he said, that only five days after the  shooting began the first plane left. Of about 2,000 Jews in Bosnia-  Herzegovina, he estimates half have left. Many of those who stayed behind  work in Sarajevo's downtown synagogue, which has been turned into a  wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380,000 meals.     The center, which has been shelled several times along with most of  Sarajevo, also runs a radio station, mail center and distributes food  packages sent by Jewish organizations around the world.     While Muslims and Jews are fighting each other in the Mideast, Jews here  say there's a long tradition of cooperation, inter-marriage and  tolerance between the two communities in Sarajevo that goes back to  centuries of Turkish occupation.     Sarajevo's Jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from Roman  Catholic Spain in 1492. The community numbered more than 14,000 before  World War II. But only 10% survived the Holocaust -- which was carried out  by the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustache in Yugoslavia. Many of the survivors were  hidden by Muslim families in Mostar.       --   Sharon Machlis Gartenberg  Framingham, MA  USA  e-mail: sharon@world.std.com      ----------------------------------------  Zafar.          tippu hassan   "

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the   operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions  were going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off hand  and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was   asked about that very matter: ""Why can't we spend a few million more  to keep instruments that we already have in place going?""    His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and  the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc  is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using  current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have  very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure  in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,  however starting a few years after he had retired he would become  one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not  funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just  as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it  to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new  missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before  the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.      --   Covert C Beach  dragon@access.digex.com "

Unlike Waco,   Californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city  streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down  with abandoned car blockades.

Billary Clinton  would get what he wanted, a War on Gunowners, the BATF would attempt  to show the anti-gun press they they really, REALLY were in charge  with a 500-man ""Charge of the Light Brigade,"" and the FBI would attempt   to show how _THEY_ really were in charge by asking the Californian   National Guard to level the area with artillary!    :-) :-) :-) "

There are several things in ITAR which have never been tested in court.   The concensus appears to be:    You could be arrested as an international arms trafficker.

Some of what I   would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may   never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -   unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars   as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and   a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time   - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.   Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.    Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there   and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief   in an afterlife.      The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks   and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light   crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people   is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating   the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or   thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.    But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.     Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live   in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport   currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The   impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists   that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped   into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life   forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels   (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains   one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,   malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed   the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80   miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters   much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of   high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.     But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't   fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever -   like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch   commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,   truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.    If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at   least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last  beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.      To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage   of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at   8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the   local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it   if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could   be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky   while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that   as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,   even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.     Regards,   Wm. Hathaway   Baltimore MD  "

2,"  It is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in  fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field.    It probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is  usually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). Limited tinea  pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as  well as systemic medication i.e. tablets. Finally, a self-diagnosis is  not always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal  infection and requires very different treatment.    gervais   "

Why don't we not talk about the ""official"" definition of  foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent.  More money is spent  stationing troops in Germany (ie paying the troops, maintaining bases and equip,  etc) than in Israel.  Plus, Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fight  her battles.  If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean   shipping lanes, Norway, and other trouble spots in the world, you will see that  aid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  And so what -  so what if Israel gets the most (assuming I buy your feeble argument)?  What   is your point?  Do you not want to subsidize Israel?  Well, you have two options  1) Start your own campaign, get elected as president, and then force congress  to cut all aid to Israel or 2) get the fuck out!

Yeah, but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested  mistakenly and has their life turned upside-down because some law  enforcement agency *does* make a chip::person association?    I wonder if there are any plans to keep these records (e.g. encode the  serial number into the UPC scanned at K-Mart along with the credit  card info, voila.)    At least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or  whatever (i.e. to be coming from your telephone number the person  likely is in your house etc.), plus or minus some shenanigans of  course.    But I'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id, recording  the conversation, then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes  up as owner of that id (mistakenly, maybe you sold the phone at a  garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever.) They  might only know who one side of the conversation is, for example.    Anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such  databases loses two points. First, law enforcement agencies can of  course do this. Second, they're only forbidden from BUDGETING any  money for it. The IRS, for example, does do this anyhow. They just  don't spend any money on it so it's (technically) legal I guess.    Instead they probably trade little favors with companies like  mastercard (if you're the IRS I'll bet you have a *lot* of  opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.)    I know, an IRS guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen, I  could hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone during  a dispute I had with them (to intimidate me, actually, not much of a  dispute, I didn't particularly disagree, but for some reason this  fellow wanted to play tough guy with me, I hope he's better now.)    Amazing stuff he had at his finger tips.

It gives police the power to put  innocent people in jail because they (the police) find something they don't  understand.  Most police don't know what the return key does, never mind the  difference between a core file and classified military secrets.    There are plenty of scenarios where the user would have no idea what something  is either.  It could be uninitialized junk.  The burden of proof is on the  user to show that it's something a normal upstanding citizen should have.  No  one should ever be put in that situation, especially in America.    What's disgusting about this is how easily most people go along with it, to  provide a bargaining chip against some hypothetical *alleged* child molester  or drug dealer, or whatever bad thing is in style at the time.  Basically most  people don't have a clear distinction between criminals and suspects.    As an analogy, it's like they find a loose screw in your house, and they  insist that you're building a bomb or machine gun.  They ask you where it came  from (like you'd know), and ask you to prove your claim.  When you explain it  in such simple terms, people may start to get the idea.    As a matter of fact, i do keep random files on my disk.  The reason is,  without special-purpose hardware, it takes a long time to generate good random  bits.  I have programs that crank out a couple bits per minute, which is  pretty conservative, but over time that's more than i need.    If you think about it, there's no point in actually encrypting random data,  because it just gives you different random data.  If you want some data to  look like an encrypted file, you just put an appropriate header on it.  If  enough people do this, some of them will be put in jail.    When you get arrested and the police ask for your keys, you can tell them it's  just random junk, although of course they won't believe you.  While you're  sitting in jail, you can take consolation in the fact that the government will  burn a few CPU-years trying to find something that's not there.    --  Joe Keane, amateur cryptologist  jgk@osc.com (uunet!amdcad!osc!jgk) "

Can we perhaps as the  question of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal  to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written  with something else in mind and ""propoganda"" put out by its supporters.

That  would seem to be irrelevent.    >The  >difficulty that most US posters seem to have is in considering that their  >arguments may have been flawed or no longer apply to modern societies.            Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe  they no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were  good arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because  they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't  think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.    >If they were alive today the one opinion we could count upon these men to  >express is that a careful study of the mechanisms of government is necessary  >and that an ongoing improvement of the same is required.

Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While  the Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although  badly) to the U.S. President.            Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives  is ""in principle"" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)  but in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the  Constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh  darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put  those extra restrictions on the Senate in?    >|>       I disagree.

These decisions are pushed up to the next higher level  >instead.           Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell  you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of  government to ""attack"" which presents them with the best chance of  getting what they want.  With national ""interest groups"" it is simply  a very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a  law rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less   ""contributions"" to make.            Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at  the Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little  state battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,  medicine, and most other questions.          Local government has not ""failed"" in that it hasn't done what it  should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local  interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their  rules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,  only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because  it can impose its will on the lower.          I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres  of the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-  and such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed  to a local crime?          The more people want the more Congress will take power to ""sell""  it to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of ""special interests""  is coincidence with the increased power of Congress.    >|>       Congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than  >|>enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its  >|>original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.  >  >If they were to start from a social welfare model instead of the current   >""no state subsidy motto"" they would be better placed.

The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual  need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher  levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to  in effectiveness.    >In order to set up a school project in New York state you have to pay off the  >other 49 states with pork - defense contracts, agricultural subsidies etc.  >Or to be precise 30 of the states since you need 60 to beat the filibuster.           Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I  remain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable  of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if  you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the ""pork"" in that  state.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power  and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get  what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.           The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must ""buy off""  states, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.    >|>       It is not a case of the system of government they created failing,  >|>but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically  >|>wanted to avoid.

But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself   that you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres  has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact  national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem  is significantly reduced.    >The current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility  >to come to a decision.            The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable  to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering  the government the usually the institution with the sole power to  enforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those  decisions a good thing.    >Pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't  >work unless the lower levels are less corrupt. In most cases they are worse,  >not better.           The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have  more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution  than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is  harder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing  new deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out  without a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the  entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different  areas, different solutions may be called for.           And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local  and state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to  the city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the  majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end  up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in  Washington with half a million or more constituents.           I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels  are more corrupt.      >|>       I fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were  >|>placed on the veto.

Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were  arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators  should be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was  suppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was  nothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.  Which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders  wanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,  I never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,  which places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for  the House.    >The   >US constitution gives almost no reasoning as to how it should work.

(There are a couple of other  examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the  reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)    >That the veto was meant to be an exceptional measure follows from the   >fact of the senate.

However, I also believe it is inevitable considering  the Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they  want them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying  about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which  almost necessitates its abuse.    >|>       There is no limit in the Constitution to the President's veto power  >|>regarding what a bill is for.

Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when  dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have  not been successful.

No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority  for *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population  groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities  should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough  about.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority  being capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing  the *federal* system against action.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------  David Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the  last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though  I haven't seen any Glock's).     With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual  rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two  cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a   large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to  semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand  him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is  very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something   like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that  ""different is good"".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in   more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a  certain ""propriatory nature"" of each gun that takes some familiarity to   learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar  with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least  slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.    |>   |> Define ""armed better"".

Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either  pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi  auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.      |> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again  |>   to rotate to the next round.    I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA  semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same  round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will  always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud  but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will  now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide  on a misfire takes very little time.      |> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the  |>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an  |>   easy motion, even one handed.    Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not  necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and  at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the  round to set it off.    |> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines  |>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.    The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed  loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two  handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that  while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the  gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always   take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing  a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can  still be used if needed later).      |>   |> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell  |>   first, time spent which can be fatal.

Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear  it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire  with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto  but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).      |> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round  |>   and cock the hammer.

All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any  safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should  say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's  no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing  pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage  carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed  of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm  not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was  initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining  the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and   shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in  a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets  you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.    |>   |> Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly  |> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver  for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all  your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger  far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that  nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and  relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew  off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.    |>   |> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun  |> the police don't know nothing about firearms.

I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry  weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to  r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the  shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the  fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is  a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.      |>   |> What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime?

I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,  i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those who  have the right for it.    As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against the  current negotiations and the so-called peace process, they  are not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictions  that Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the same  for Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of ""negotiations"" in Madrid,  and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying why  are you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.  I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have to  loose ?

2,"    I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of  mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot  of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years  (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from  painful experience:      1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.       Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more       sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.      2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear       that these things will itch for months.      3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of       it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,       since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could       find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special       collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is       required to get it.      4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old       folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall       reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers       burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I       think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some       sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.      5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.       A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally       applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is       another preparation called ""Chig Away"" that is a combination of       sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was       prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In       the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get       up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we       live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They       apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur       as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)      6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget       the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment       that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone       creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine       (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.       Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this       counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think       it gains nothing).      7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved       by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery       as well.    Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban  doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors  seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I  suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers  would make a *lot* of money.  --   Gary H.

Is it simply that we have come to  view one as acceptable, while the other is viewed as a fundamental  violation of one's rights?

The thing  that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying  a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their  person when they are out on the street somewhere.  I'm sure that not many  people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.  Speaking as someone who lives in Illinois (the only place where the above  quoted law is relevant :-)) I know that it is legal to own a handgun here (I  am not taking into account city ordinances).  I could care less about whether  or not I can carry concealed at home.         I only care about the fact that  I can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street.  Freeman loves to be accurate and I can understand that (especially not) but he  seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense.  I am not going to followup to this thread anymore because I believe that it is  useless to argue these points anymore.  The only thing that is happening now  is that Freeman and I are ""running around in circles"" trying to prove each  other wrong and I do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  Of course  now Freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier  posts but what can I do.  My only advice for Freeman - quit being so picky  about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some-  times.    Jason - u28037@uicvm.cc.uic.edu "
2,"  Can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the  following two health problems:    First, I was recently diagnosed (using a UGI series) as having a  Schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. As I understand it,  the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally  have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki  ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,  if I'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,  food occasionally gets ""stuck"" before reaching my stomach. This results  in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.  Fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,  and causes frequent discomfort.    My doctor wants to ""dilate"" the ring using the  following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach  for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing  some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know  if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,  was it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on  safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become  a common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding  procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,  especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,  reaction to anesthesia).    The second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number  of ""extra"" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there  has been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC's in 24  hrs, along with a few PAC's. (Many days, there are far more than this,  however-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist  indicated that such a number was ""normal"". It certainly doesn't  feel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of  extended ""runs"" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause  severe light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good  health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or  caffeine, etc. I'm willing to accept the extra beats as ""normal"", but don't  want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number  of PVC's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something  as simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying  down for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly  be related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the  same time.    Thanks for any help/advice!      ===============================================================================  =============================================================================== "

Actually, severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are  possible, and sinus surgery which widens the ostia - from the normal 2  mm to about 10 mm - should relieve this.  There are non-surgical ways,  however, to keep the ostia open (however, in a few individuals, their  ostia are naturally very small), and Dr. Ivker's book talks about this.  The underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is NOT cured by this kind of  sinus surgery, though.    About asthma, that's a little more controversial.  Dr. Ivker, in his book,  ""Sinus Survival"", *speculates* (and says it's not proven), that many cases  of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage  (postnasal drip) from the sinuses.  He's had many patients who've found  relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated -  not clinical proof, but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.    Before doing any sinus surgery, first get THE BOOK - it discusses surgery,  as well as a good non-surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

2,"  Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For  example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe""  mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if  maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy  gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.      For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments  ""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e.  as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging  congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky  scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....      I've heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled""  spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believe  that this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode.  This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the  spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a  (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.  At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can  continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to  the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the  spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be  prepared if necessary.      As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is  beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,  great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.  By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps  someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the  data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.    I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which  could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to  places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,  exiting the solar system, etc).       Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,  etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case their  spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of  the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could  have some kind of routine written in for the post mission  ""drift"" phase.    So any holes in all this?      /~~~(-: James T.

0,"    With all the talk about this Clipper chip, I have developed one question...    			HOW DOES IT WORK???    If you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? Does the  other party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to   undo it? Do I use a different method for calling one party than I would for   another?. If the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone  else could also? I assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use  would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. This seems  like a fundamental question to me, but I have very little experience with  cryptosystems, other than DES. If someone could give me an explanation as  to how it would be used (remember that I have had little experience with  this sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean  an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla  coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for  diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called  ""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly  efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,  which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active  reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve  efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core  resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI  for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer  screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil  from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all  Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter  and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind  to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,  gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and  telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????    GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE  TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!    If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century.  (flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).    ----   ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

Nice to think, but naive.  The fact is that millions of people today  are sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to  receive cellular phones.  They figure the chances of being heard are  small, so they risk it.    And 99.9% of people don't understand crypto the way the least of the  sci.crypt newbies does.   If Clinton tells them it's good crypto,  they'll believe him, and send important stuff over it, and be thankful  that they're no longer using clear-voice FM cellular phones.    Only a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto.  Worse, in the  eyes of the government, which swears up and down the algorithim is  spook-level secure (and it may indeed be) the only reason you could  possibly want this extra level is to avoid police.    By using it, you'll attract attention as a likely lawbreaker.    ""Your honour, the suspect suddenly started using another level of  cryptography and we can't tap his phone calls any more.

Biden's statement were quoted by the Washington Post today:       Let me put it plainly, Mr. Secretary.  You are required to speak     diplomatically; I am not.  I cannot even begin to express to you     my contempt for a European policy that is now asking us to      participate in what amounts to a codification of the Serbian victory.     ...     What you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference,     timidity, self-delusion and hypocrisy.     ...     After they held our coats on Kuwait and Somalia, they are asking us     to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the     right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe     havens' for the Bosnians...     Let's not mince words.  European policy is based on cultural and     religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it's fair to say     that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims     were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression     instead of Serbian aggression.    Too bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which   pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger  within the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin  to predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:       I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear     this is a big deal... so they will understand.    and it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of  self-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have   aided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo has  forced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy  weaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such  conditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a ""divide-and-conquer""  game, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common  interests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression)   to start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.    One final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has  said in Rome last week that ""In practice, the embargo had the opposite  effect intended.  It made aggression certain.""    All diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace  while enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed  to this tragedy.      Sincerely,  -Josip           "
2,"    I am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9V to my  cpu board which runs at 5-6V.  The optoisolator is a 4N35.  On the led side, I put the signal I want through a 10k resistor  to the base of a 2N2222.  On the transistor side, I tie my  cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor  of 47k.    It functions OK, but seems VERY slow.  I can detect pulses  that occur at about 2kHz, but not much faster.  Isn't the  rise/fall time of this device, something like 5uS?  I should  be able to detect my target of 40kHz, but I can't get 16kHz.  This is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu  and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but I'm not  doing anything high-speed.    In the Art of Electronics, it mentions tying the base of the  phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the  speed.  Is that what I need to do?  How do I calculate the  resistor value?      --     Paul Malenfant  pmalenfa @ kitkat.webo.dg.com (508-870-6460) "

I've admired both his paintings (remember the USPS Solar System  Exploration Stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of  spaceflight.  For several years he's been working on a *big* project  which is almost ready to hit the streets.  A brochure from his  publisher has landed in my mailbox, and I thought it was cool enough  to type in part of it (it's rather long).  Especially given the Net's  strong interest in vaporware spacecraft...                     ==================================                             The Dream Machines:  An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature                                By Ron Miller                    with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke    Krieger Publishing Company  Melbourne, Florida, USA  Orig. Ed. 1993  Pre-publication $84.50  ISBN 0-89464-039-9      This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a  technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the  space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the  tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make  such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized  that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to  reach them.       Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,  attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of  technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel  became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed  than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that  matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason  as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate  reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and  knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as  well as selected events important in developing the idea of  extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological  entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and  speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between  simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal  connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every  entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every  spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This  allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize  differences, similarities, and influences.    This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,  and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic  diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and  historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The  unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and  very interesting history of the spaceship.    SPECIAL FEATURES    Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and  fictional    Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos  contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare  illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and  drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and  obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA  archives    An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

A NASA friend and I spent one     drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need     to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization     on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.    Hmmm. It actually isn't all that much, is it? Like about 2 million  km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2  per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off  with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an  unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft).  If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new  moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon.  You might have to abandon the colour, though.    Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit  unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base  to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur  compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your  uncle.  I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of  identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.    Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink  vendors? Who else might be interested?    Would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not  much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km  inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your  key growth market). I'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of  identity).    Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu "

Or are we all of a  sudden going to draw parallels to Nazi Germany and Communist Russia?    The point of the matter is that; yes this is a serious problem.  But it is  not the end of the world.  Guess what?  We're doing something now you  can't do in a Communist country or Nazi Germany.  We're complaining about  it, (or rather, you're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.

You live in one of the few countries in the world  where a person can complain without getting shot at.      People are always complaining that somebody did this wrong, or somebody  did that wrong, or whatever.  Sit down and figure out two things:    1)  What have they done right?  2)  How much worse can it get?    And you'll find that you and I, are pretty damn lucky.

Probably why  the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed (but that  is another flame-ridden story). Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are  binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from  a Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package  ported to a PC), graphical object-oriented design (its all WSIWIG postscript),   supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around   the Mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or   even VMS if you feel the need.

Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the  people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are  there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority  could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.  and it would fly using the logic above.    When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,  there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis  is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those  who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a  majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting  the hangee.    What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the  limitations on the government, probably because they know that the  people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind  tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has  been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just  shows how gullible the people have become to ""I am from the government  and am here to help you sort of line"".  We have been lied to, fed  half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control  laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on  force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able  to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch  of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don't.  The Founding Fathers  sure as hell didn't, either.    <> Mox nix, Mr. Rutledge.

I hear that they're called  >'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?  >I hope someone can help       The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,  exploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a  ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser  in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through  the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The  sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for  draft generation.    It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on  both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at   locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part  time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.  It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.  Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent,  usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically  takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed   to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.  --   John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

It makes one think that    the amp is doing nothing :)  The heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for    skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below    and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.

You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks. Just talk to  Greeks, Arabs, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under  Turkish occupation.  They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.    You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about them from  people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.

Terms of secession?  You are, of course, joking, right Nick?  Nobody  *chose* to fight.  Bosnia and Croatia were *internationally*  recognized nations when the Serbs attacked and started on their  well-documented genocide.  That makes them an outside aggressor.

2,"  About two years ago I posted the following:     I am planning to write a new book called ""Great Canadian Scientists.""  Please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca     The rules are that the person must be a Canadian citizen. They don't have  to be born in Canada or even live in Canada, but they must have (or have  had, if they are dead) Canadian citizenship while they are/were great  Canadian scientists.     About 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the  end of this posting.     I'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a  gray area here. If you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, I would be  pleased to hear them. In any event, please nominate people even if you are  not sure they are great. I would like as big a list as possible.     Please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so  that I can contact the person. If you don't know any of the above, then  give me their last known whereabouts. Also please give your reason for why  you think the person should be considered a great Canadian scientist.     After I have the list, I will choose about six of the most interesting ones  and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of Tracy  Kidder's ""Soul of a New Machine"" or some other dramatic technique.  The rest of the great Canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with   one paragraph biographies.     If you have any other ideas about this project, I am interested to hear  them.

It's amazing to see just how much was discovered  by Canadians. Actually there are many more who were born in Canada, but  became Americans after graduate school.     Please note: a lot of people have nominated Alexander Graham Bell but I  feel he was really a Scottish/American with a summer home in Canada. Now  I know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.     If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop  me a line.  ==================================================     That was two years ago. Since then, I have received a grant from Science  Culture Canada, a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the  book. Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book  for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) It will have about  40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic  boxes all around on the following subjects: Vital statistics and photo of  the scientist, Personal statement from the scientist, Narrative of a few  moments in the life of the scientist, ""What I was doing when I was 12"",  So you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, Experiment you can do. There   will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph  biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. The whole thing  will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added  richness. I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well. The text part may  also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in  Canada as well.     I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close   to being it. Hope to find one soon.      I would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the  pure sciences of Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Also criticisms of   the list are welcomed. Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed.     I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian  Scientists, and to discuss what is ""great"" what is ""Canadian"" and what is  ""scientist"".

You mean he talks about those Jews, who, because of their self  hatred, spend all their time attacking Judaism, Jews, and Israel,  using the most despicable of anti-Semetic stereotypes?    	I don't think we need to coin a term like ""Jedeo-Nazism"" to  refer to those Jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the  Nazis, do their dirty work for them.

Trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then  goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..  these ckts require uAmps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt  gel cell of a few Amphours would last the six weeks.  Then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3"" or 4"" of foam or build a box  of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...  build a small heater out of 10-50 Watt resistors in series to keep the battery  and ckts warm.  2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.    Insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - AL  rated devices are good to -55 C.. The batteries have a considerable reduction  in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..    hope this helps  RW     ( is this to long winded for the net??)(be gentle)...  --  "

Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls  the rig an ""electronic brake"" since the engine noticeably slows when the  key is down.    My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's  astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with  the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the   distributor pickup.  Very poor design.    I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing  to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is  wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting  out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference  between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are  usually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation  when you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when  you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details  and addresses).    >Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.

Good advice.  Hams will frequently give their call, and will never use  a ""handle.""  They are less apt to use immense amounts of profanity as well,  but that's not to say that they don't from time to time.    --scott "

2,"  I know that there is a relationship between Fibromyalgia and deep   sleep.  I believe that there are five levels of sleep.  I think   that R.E.M. sleep is the third deepest level of sleep and that   there are two deeper levels of sleep.  If I am in error in any of   this, please let me know.    Which level of sleep is thought to be deficient in people with   Fibromyalgia?  Are there any known sleep disturbances associated   with CFS?  What sleep disturbances (if any) are associated with   clinical depression?  Do antidepressants correct the sleep   disturbances in these diseases?  Are there any good books or   medical journal articles about sleep disturbances and these   diseases?  Thank you in advance for all replies.    ...

2,"   ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!      This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,   ether sucking structures, AND why we observe ""orbital"" motion!!      Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic   waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the   Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.       I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact   that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the   earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption   that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)      The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the   development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications   of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!      REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!        1    I dream like this: ether based reality       The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations   start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices  both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,   converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.   (non-spinning lattice = ""dark matter"")      The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image   of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us   being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by   the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is   spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner   kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a   faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground   of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but   its ""foot print"" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])        The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self   spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is   itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the   wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The ""orbit"" of the  earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around  by the sun's ether feild.      The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and ""distance""   apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because   the ""path"" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like   sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half   turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has   got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to   the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a ""j"" hook at   the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the   whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.       With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon   can be about as big as ""earth's"" shadow upon it, and at other times   totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,   would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they   look about the same size?       O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S   E       /     \                  M    |      |      OR                M               \ _ _ /                                  S                                        The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate  of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating ""turntable view""   of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a   half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the   day. Try and draw that ""earth shadow."") Its only the moon's image   which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is   the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away   from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.      ""Light-Years"" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is   closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase   of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.   (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be   essentially happening now. The ""piece"" of light may have experienced   many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.      To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to   de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design   a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like   trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)      To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd   look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just   might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the   spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+   billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG   backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card   for Pentium!)      Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound   media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I   would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which   I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.   [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a   two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I   could get with my machine's receiver next to it.        If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT   PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of   life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our   thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By   eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant   instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or   biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what   they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we   don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and   that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where   did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it   is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then   die)      Warning about writing to the past:  I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel   future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.   There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an   Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,   and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the   others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by   ""advising"" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into   reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that   the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to   provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it   in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his   control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying   that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve   souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was   finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in   our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it   seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then   some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no   more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped   through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that   he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,   existing only on the wind.       MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls   whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat   others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a   lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for   playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)      Accepting rides to the past:  Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a   Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go   ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry.   I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes   your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross   paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own   course of history, none the wiser.      As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped   back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still   make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with   every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which   loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.   But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had   to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand   to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.       How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,   our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this:   Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to   congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks   are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big   corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the   banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but   mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14   hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time   to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If   we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if   the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?       In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, ""its chaos!"" They   said, ""no, its order."" He defined chaos as that which is he was not   able to control.      Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy   would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no   language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)  (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and   pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably   naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should   be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about.   They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers   might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a   different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.      Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a   huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat   only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and   need a lot less sleep.      UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The   troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill   each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)      Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot   tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they   suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that   they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.       Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women   and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut   from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think   that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as   mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples   of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.      That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He   tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which   the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll   play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll   whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to   live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was   right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go   back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over   your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality   in which you don't want to be a part of.       I don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just   that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path. Maybe these   thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.          "

As a Latter-day Saint, I found John's statement *not at all* ludicrous...    Please allow me to explain myself.  In 1838, the governor of Missouri,  governor Boggs, issued his so-called ""Mormon extermination order.""  The  only crime (""illegal activity"") the Latter-day Saints had committed, was  their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (Missouri still  allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in Missouri.    I guess the Mormons ""got what they deserved,"" because they refused to bow  to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. This ""disobedience""  brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from  their lands and settlements...    In the 1850s, the so-called ""Utah-War"" was forced upon the early Mormon  settlers, and their ""illegal activities"" consisted no less in living as  their conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in Utah's  (or ""Deseret Territory"" as it was called at the time) constitutional  daily affairs.  (In order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of  the United States of America, an entire army under the command of General  Johnson (hence ""Johnson's Army""), invaded the territory to ""restore""  Uncle Sam's law and order...)    History has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events  that might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit and  intent.  That same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found in  this user-group: when we tried to organize ""soc.religion.mormon"" and/or  ""talk.religion.mormon,"" a whole bunch of ""charitable"" believers effectively  blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to Mormonism  et al in an appropriate forum.  We really must be a ""threat"" to various  establishments...  Frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-  tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  It is ironic that those  who oppose us, point to all kinds of ""justifications"" to do so, despite  their claims of adhering to a gospel of love...    In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and  I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their  lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from  being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I  may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the  case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church  leader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-""Peace Keeper""  missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another ""inspired"" decision from  secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough  for the feds to back off.    Lest anyone believe I do not believe in government: I do, but NOT without  questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and  resolves.  The government's actions around the Mt. Carmel compound in Waco  was NOT wise, neither was it necessary.  David Koresh did NOT pose a great  threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with  John, I too wonder who or what's next...    #|> We used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise  #|> of their rights to worship and bear arms.

Could it be that  the ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would you  interpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck did  the Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,  Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.    David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the ""evil"" guy (by the  executioners), while the actions of all those ""valiant and brave"" officers  may have been ""regrettable,"" but alas, ""necessary"" to serve some dubious  public/national interest. --I guess they are still figuring it out how to  sell this one to the nation...    #|> Of course, to Jews and Mormons this is just a broken record.

There are, but not any that would help Texans: In many states,  such laws have been found to violate the state constitution.   But the federal Second Amendment does not apply directly to the  states. It was written to limit the federal government only.   The Fourteenth Amendment was written to extend the restrictions  of the Bill of Rights to the state level. However, the exact  wording of the Fourteenth Amendment is very vague. The Supreme  Court has been dancing around the issue without facing it  directly for over 100 years. In practice, the Bill of Right  (indirectly applies through the Fourteenth) applies to the  state governments only if the Supreme Court has ruled that   particular provision. The Court has made no such rulings on  the Second Amendment.                                                     Frank Crary                                                   CU Boulder   "
0,"        Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much  of a change is it?  ATT's last product in this area (a) was priced over  $1000, as I suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer   with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. Thus,  aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture,  Clipper seems to be ""more of the same"", rather than a new direction.     Yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote  more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going  to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other  end probably doesn't have one anyway.  Am I missing something?     The real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air-  tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.  That  has got to a problematic scenario for them, even if the extent of usage  never surpasses the 'underground' stature of PGP.  --   Ray Berry kb7ht ray@ole.cdac.com  rjberry@eskimo.com  73407.3152@compuserve.com "

2,"  Hi,  	I'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo-  genics. The drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food   creating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. There are all sorts of  warnings about fevers, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, ect..  	The silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not   require a change in diet. Is this possible? Are the pills dangerous or just  hoaxes?    Karen "
2,"  I booked a hotel (Red Roof Inn) last week in Cincinnati (Blue Ash, which  is at the northern tip of the metro. Cincy area).  I chose it for a few  reasons.    1.  All hotels in and near Dayton were booked solid.    2.  This hotel is only costing $28/night.    3.  It was one of about 4 rooms left on the night I reserved.    4.  Cincinnati probably has more to to at night than Dayton.  I intend        to hit the riverboat entertainment at dusk!    If anyone has other suggestions for nightlife, please let me know of  other hot spots.  Thanks!    Mark "

I wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private  sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least  partially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any  private sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly  evaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)  The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out  there not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)    My suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper  systems.  If not we're in trouble.    Given that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like  to think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.  They know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken  seriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know  little about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step  in the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning  or SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the ""Clipper"" system is easily  justified ""Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying  to subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative  so use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.""  How can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing  law enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system  the only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration  knows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for  drug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.    Don't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.  Either banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations  collective I.Q. is about that of a potato.    Why do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,  and NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the  stuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the  hell would they jump the gun?    >	My interpretation.  >  >	Andrew  >  >>-Tim May, whose sig block may get him busted in the New Regime  >                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  >  >	Isn't this just a little melodramatic?    I really wonder.    To wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:    The White House  Office of the Press Secretary c/o:  Presidential Comment Line (fax)  (202) 456-2461     April 17, 1993     Sir and/or Madam:        I must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and  cryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.     It is apparent to me that those who drafted the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the ""Big Brother Proposal"") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep            ends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from ""experts"" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.     In addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how ""tamper proof"" the key escrows might be.     I cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the ""Clipper Chip Proposal"" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti            lize the ""Big Brother Chip.""     Unfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like ""harmony,"" ""right to encryption,"" and ""voluntary.""     It mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is ""I can't believe it's happening here.""  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; ""When is the Reichstag fire planned for?""

Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style  with extreeme Machismo. Perhaps thats not the way to handle  it.     It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many  have done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisons  with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous.    Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your  post desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made some  very good points about how a low key approach might have been   more effective.    The point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govt  played the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. They  had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they   just were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be?    If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps  be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed  in the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made the  same mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in  for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I would  because with all those press about its very difficult not to try  the macho stuff.      The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access  to. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was  cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They  knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This  may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have   been a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used  the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny that  few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the  death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted  to arrest their former ally.      |>And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun  |>discussion.  Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners  |>deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government  |>agents.  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his  |>guns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal,  |>or whatever!     Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired  on the police helicopter. No matter whether the warrant was or  was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out   thought that it was. Thus the assault on them was completely  inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to  employ.    Of course we have to consider the guns issue. That is the whole  core of the question. Everything else is a diversion.      Phill Hallam-Baker "

Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can   engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order   harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a   satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of   months to years.          My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT   satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In   particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in   altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude   of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18   March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the   limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.)         This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71   degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is   unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But   it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the   situation.         (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

But to  think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and  that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These  agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have  ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then  tell the Prez, who says, ""I knew all along"".  While this may not seem right,  or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command  leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after  all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and  maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if  they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses  are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority  religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of  cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.  Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do  not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is  digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are  associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about  would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt  BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was  unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S  government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I  do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said  are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President  Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives  should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from  reaching its full potential.          "

2,"  There have been a few postings in the past on alleged pathological   (esp. neurological) conditions induced by playing video games  (e.g. Nintendo). Apparently, there have been reported several cases of  ""photosensitive epilepsy"", due to the flashing of some  patterns and the strong attention of the (young) players.  One poster to comp.risks reported some action from  the British Government.    A quick search in a database reported the following two published  references:    1. E.J. Hart, Nintendo epilepsy, in New England J. of Med., 322(20), 1473  2. TK Daneshmend et al., Dark Warrior epilepsy, BMJ 1982; 284:1751-2.    I would appreciate if someone could post (or e-mail)   any reference to (preferably published) further work on the subject.  Any pointer to other information and/or to possible technical tools   (if any) for reducing the risks are appreciated.    Many thanks,    Antonella D'Alessandro,  Pisa -- Italy. "

I'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument.  In my  view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is  secret, leading to suspicion that there is a back door.  Without complete  disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled, no matter how many trusted  experts are allowed to look at it in isolation.    Is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm?  The only  concern I've seen with making Skipjack public is that someone could build  Clipperphones without registering the keys.  Assume F can really be kept  secret as the Government assumes.  Then as part of the initial connection,  a Clipperphone executes a protocol with the Pseudophone to demonstrate  that they both know F.  For example, the initiating phone picks a number Q  and sends E[Q; F].  The receiver sends back E[Q+1; F], and the initiator  sends back E[Q+2; F] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a  random 64-bit block.  Repeat in the opposite direction with another Q so  it can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential  numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial  numbers of subsequent challenges.  This way Clipperphones will talk only  to other Clipperphones.  Of course the Pseudo Company can build their own  proprietary Skipjack phone, but the Presidential Fact Sheet implies that  they won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow.    What's wrong with this picture?  It depends of F staying secret and on  Skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis, but the Government appears to  believe in both of these.  Even if the particular Q&A I suggest has some  flaw, I imagine there's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that doesn't.    smb says:  >The third, and most serious issue, is whether or not Clipper is a good  >idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.    Agreed.  My view, and you can quote me: if it's not worth doing, it's  not worth doing well.  --   	Jim Gillogly  	Hevensday, 3 Thrimidge S.R. 1993, 20:48 "

(Flames to /dev/null)    --------- Begin Enclosed Article -----------    			THE UNABRIDGED SECOND AMENDMENT    			      by J. Neil Schulman    If you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,  right ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call  would be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call  if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning  of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?    That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los  Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton  Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the  foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.  Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor  journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of  ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus.""    A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's  expertise.    Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades  before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at  USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the  professional aspects of journalism for ""Editor and Publisher"", a weekly  magazine focusing on the journalism field.    He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam  Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's  fifth book on usage, ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus,"" has been in  continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner  of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.    That sounds like an expert to me.    After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced  myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent  the following letter:    ""I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in  English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United  States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.    ""The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being  necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep  and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'    ""The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the  sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a  free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect  to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the  right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'    ""I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into  consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted  entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,  since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation  regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever  analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to  stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under  oath to support, if necessary.""    My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,  then concluded:    ""I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task  with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is  vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.  While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of  its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.""    After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for  his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our  opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political  subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have  inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):    [Copperud:] ""The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the  security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your  letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a  clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is  followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb  'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for  maintaining a militia.    ""In reply to your numbered questions:    [Schulman:] ""(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep  and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?""    [Copperud:] ""(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear  arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by  others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect  to a right of the people.""    [Schulman:] ""(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted  by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a  preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state  that such right 'shall not be infringed'?""    [Copperud:] ""(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence  is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be  preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.""    [Schulman:] ""(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms  conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact  necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not  existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,  shall not be infringed' null and void?""    [Copperud:] ""(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to  keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence  of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the  right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated  militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep  and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.""    [Schulman:] ""(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary  to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place  conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such  right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?""    [Copperud:] ""(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as  previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the  militia.""    [Schulman:] ""(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated  militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'  'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?""    [Copperud:] ""(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior  authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian  control over the military.""    [Schulman:] ""(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the  changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200  years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the  intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.""    [Copperud:] ""To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the  meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the  amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: ""Since a  well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the  right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'    [Schulman:] ""As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also  appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second  Amendment to the following sentence,    ""A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free  State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be  infringed.'    ""My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,    ""(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way  the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;  and    ""(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people  to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for  example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?""    [Copperud:] ""(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the  amendment in grammatical structure.    ""(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the  possibility of a restricted interpretation.""    Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his  cover letter: ""With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative  efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach  any conclusion.""    So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what  many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally  protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all  governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.    As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the  Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that  part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the  old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.    And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed  officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States  ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.  American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning  arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements  regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an  abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,  guaranteed by the Constitution.    And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the  rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.    it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to  preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our  elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding  them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who  decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but  means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?    Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution  of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend  that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

Greeks,Armenians,Kurds(I must say Turk-Kurd relations are   improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to Turkey's neighbours.  The Turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the Germans grudgingly accepted   Versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the   German people).The Greeks who had an army there,were there with BRITISH  and FRENCH backing to enforce Sevres.      In possibly the first example of appeasement the Young Turk government  managed screwed the Treaty of Laussane out of the weak allies,this was after   the Greek forces were were destroyed at Smyrna.When this occurred incidently,  FRENCH warships were in the harbour and many Greeks trying escape swam to the   FRENCH warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the FRENCH  as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.

Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished   of butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only   the killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian   Armenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of   Ottoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines   genocide as acting with a       'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a      national, ethnic, racial or religious group.'     History shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate   the Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the   Armenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including   U.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government's policy   as a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of   the x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the   extermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor   those who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians.     The eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,  beyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people  during the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy  was clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian   territories.    The Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and  their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.  The massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and  perpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian   Government.    The principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were  Dro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,  Karakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.

We ran into one of my relatives at the   bus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,  near the store. Well at first we didn't know what was happening, and then a  fellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, ""What are you  standing here for? Go home immediately!"" I asked, ""What's going on?"" He says,   ""What's the matter, can't you see, they've overturned a car and they're   killing Armenians!"" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.    We sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our   courtyard. But the neighbors wouldn't let them in the building. There were   about 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They  were shouting something, but you couldn't understand it. It wasn't one voice   or two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.  They went up to the third _floor, and we see that they're breaking glass and   throwing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one   has a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a   guitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.    We had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School   No. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families   there with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only   known Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani   guard at the school let us in. At first he didn't want to, but there was   nowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We   were told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our   microdistrict.    We went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.    On the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be  used to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of   them and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I  asked him for assistance. I say, ""We're in School No. 33, we need to be   evacuated."" Well he says, ""Got it, wait there, I'm sending out help now.""    I know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with  him personally. When I called he said, ""Muslimzade here.""    About two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out  the window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, ""Armenians, come   out, we're here to get you."" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in   their hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, ""Where should I go?"" I   say, ""If your life is of any value to you you'll go down there and say that   the Armenians were here and that they left."" That's what he did. He went down   there and said, ""The Armenians were here,"" he said, ""I let them out the back   door, they went that way."" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and   noise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.    So the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!  Instead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that  Muslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that   we were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the   morning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.    In the morning we went to my relative's in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers   took us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there   were lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy,   about three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn't a single doctor,   nothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was  just very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything  they could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his   mother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...    I searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I  wanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third  floor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping,   with their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of   them.    There were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten,   everyone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City  Party Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage   was 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being  sold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to   get the things any cheaper.    I met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in  his eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we   worked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw   me and there was nothing he could say, he just cried. You can understand his   feelings, of course.

1,"  Here's something Preston Covey (professor of ethics at CMU) wrote:    From: ""Preston K. Covey"" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>  Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)      Folks,    Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal  carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled ""Armed Force.""  I  felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat  that ""A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.""  I sent  the following to the WSJ.    -----    Gun Stats & Mortal Risks    Preston K. Covey      	Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~  2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns  in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King  County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more  likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to  kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it  has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated  by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of  the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine  (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping  firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~      	Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of  bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:   What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither  the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the  risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control  do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of  cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the  risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful  here.     	The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us  off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a  misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice  and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far  outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your  car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or  an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not  take the bus?      	Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company  of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at  stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:    	The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the  number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense  (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed  by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation  is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other  cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12  accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided  by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King  County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of  homes unaccounted.    	The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on  six counts:    	1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or  acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and  neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is  that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,  dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,  but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are  relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the  calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless  Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is  criminological hogwash.    	2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs  populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories  -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited  by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities  like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is  very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but  avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with  histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and  certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious  risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as  ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither  gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or  vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver  crucially affect the risk.     	3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is  that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill  than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of  personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike  Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43  times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun  Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this  particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about  whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by  tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question  begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any  case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal  instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths  are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility  obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by  gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to  NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.   People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their  homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection  course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and  sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death  as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard  and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they  disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and  other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we  resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose  norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign  us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in  the matter.    	4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the  NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,  including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total  death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other  studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from  homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these  suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true  that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously  true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these  suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of  research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is  wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce  L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,  1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of  Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of  the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to  ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the  causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a  profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally  disregard this issue.    	5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable  rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the  NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.   But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled  self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case  dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of  justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story  on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women  who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,  1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic  cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were  reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported  that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In  Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error  by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged  by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.     	6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation  are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The  divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not  aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even  shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the  coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy  is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure  the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as  opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or  deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where  no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed  to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the  compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by  criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,  Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  	Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are  based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is  high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare  better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance  or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year  by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and  accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable  statistic than the NEJM scare stat:      A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or  other crime than to kill anybody.       	Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;  what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We  should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation  of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.   Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by  uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we  can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we  hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.    --   Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com "
0,"  What is the expected run time (+/- a factor of 10) on a 486DX/50  using the best known algorithm for finding the shortest path  solution for Rubicks Cube from a randomly chosen position?    I have read the FAQ and followed the recent discussion on Rubicks  Cube but I don't believe this question has been answered.  Notice  that I am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the   SHORTEST path, not just any solution.    It seems to me that the underlying assumption is that such a program  would need to do a brute force search though 10^20 positions.  That  seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and I want to   know if someone has significantly improved on that.    I have some ideas of my own on how to approach this problem, but  before I spend to much time developing them I wanted to know if  someone else has already done the work.    ADMINISTRIVIA:  I have posted this to three groups and attempted  to set the followup to rec.puzzles which seems to me to be the  place to continue this discussion.  I will cross post a summary  when and if it becomes appropriate.  Email replies gladly accepted.    Jimmy  jru@Comtech.com  "

0,"Nntp-Posting-Host: sunspot.ece.clarkson.edu    It might pay to start looking at what this proposal might mean to a  police agency.  It just might be a bad idea for them, too.    OK, suppose the NY State Police want to tap a suspect's phone.  They  need a warrant, just like the old days.  But unlike the old days, they  now need to        (a) get two federal agencies to give them the two parts of         the key.    Now, what happens if there's a tiff between the two escrow houses?  Posession/release of keys becomes a political bargaining chit.  State  and lower-level police agencies have to watch the big boys play politics,  while potentially good leads disappear, lives and property are lost,  statutes of limitations run out, etc.  Not to mention: a moderately  clever person who suspects the police are after her/him will be buying  new phones faster than tap requests can be processed.  Or using stolen  ones.  [Will the Turing Police come and arrest you for transmitting  without a dialing license?]    There's also bureacracy and security problems -- within each escrow house,   how will requests for key disclosure be authenticated?  Put in enough  safeguards of the kind bureaucrats and activists feel comfortable with, and   it might take a LONG time to get that key.  [Even when a request is approved,   how is the key going to be disclosed?  Will it be encrypted by a Clipper-type  chip for transmission?  In a bureaucracy the size of the Federal  Government, with a databank of the necessary size, and data traffic of  the projected volume, there's going to be a lot of weak links.  How many of   these kinds of problems will be open for public or ""expert"" scrutiny?]      Furthermore, the Feds might be leery of handing completed keys around,   even to State Police agencies: a trust and security issue.  This would be   an especially acute issue if some other State's Police had mishandled a   key, resulting in lawsuits, financial settlements, and political   embarassment.  So, the Feds implement it this way:        (b) some federal agency gets the keys, performs the tap, and         turns the results over to the NY State Police.    But let's say Cuomo's been causing some problems over a Clinton  Aid-To-Urban-Areas proposal.  Or there just happens to be a turf war  going on between the State cops and the Justice department on a case.  Now, not only do we have the keys as a political chit, we have an  extra player in the game *and* we have the tap's tapes as another  bargaining chit.  Again, the State Police lose.    I understand that (legal) wiretaps are quite expensive to maintain.

1,"    From the Santa Rosa (Cal.) Press-Democrat, April 15, 1993, p. B2:        Male sex survey: Gay activity low        A new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough      examination of American men's sexual practices published since      the Kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2      percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and      1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.        The figures on homosexuality in the study released Wednesday      by the Alan Guttmacher Institute are significantly lower than      the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional      wisdom since it was published in the Kinsey report.    The article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.  The median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.  Compared to the table I have already posted from Masters, Johnson,  and Kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that  homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general  male population.  It's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for  straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically  how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.  --   Clayton E.

The problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters  to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.    The sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to  attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. If the FBI had  had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type  raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.  It really was a no win situation. Koresh had plenty of opportunity   to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 ATF officers. Instead  he ordered the murder of the children.      In order to reject the word of the FBI and BATF it is neccessary to beleive  the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the   suicide/murder of his other 80 followers. According to the account given  the BATF attempted to serve a warrant upon Koresh at the ranch and were met  by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. The Koresh/gun supporter  claim that the BATF started shooting simply does not stand up. If the   AFT had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier  grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. For all practical purposes  they were unarmed, the B-D followers had automatic weapons.      The B-D seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. The B-D were  quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any  time. A commando assault was the only other likely action that could have  achieved that objective, that would have been very risky, orders of   magintude harder than Antebbe or the Iranian Embassy Seige. Airplanes  and Embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch   apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties  than 80.    Allowing the siege to go on was not an option either, besides the serious  risk that Koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the   question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over  a prolonged period. The longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared  Koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. Rather than go  in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.      Can you think of a better way of getting the children out?    A 100% certain way?      The people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire  government story. This is simply rationalisation. It is not enough for   them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. That would require  them to come up with a solution themselves. Instead they have to come  up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to  set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them  to get gun control legislation through.    This conspiracy theory assumes that the BATF deliberately got 4 of its  agents killed and that the FBI etc actually enjoy sitting out in the  middle of Texas being shot at by religious nutters.    Still the conspiracy theory is comforting, it allows them to pretend that  WACO proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in   resolving a hostage crisis. No govt in the world has ever faced a   comparable situation, quite probably there was no manner in which it  could be peacefully resolved. The blame does not rest on the FBI, it  rests on the fact that Koresh was allowed to get so far, in particular  the person who tipped the B-D off in advance has the murder of 4 ATF  agents and 17 children on his or her conscience.      There are a large number of people in the US who predict the end of society  preach salvation through armed security. The fact is that these are the  very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. The next WACO  may not be religious nutters but a political movement. A splinter group  of the Klu Klux Klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example  and holding several hundred children hostage.    The only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent  them arising. No other government in the world has faced such a situation.   this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power  weaponry to become avaliable to any little Hitler or would be Messiah  to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.

2,"    Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.    The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the  Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns  have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically  located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,  and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)  from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the  office he works for is an administrative convenience.    I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.  At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,  but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),    The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber  about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).  The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several  hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston  is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens  of atmospheres.    The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until  a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.  The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch  bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they  intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel  could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to  move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used  in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter  and about 50 cm long.    All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen  gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the  barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a  sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The  plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped  in the barrel ahead of the projectile.      The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic  water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic  projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,  the projectile vaporizes.    The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is  about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km  if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun  to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can  fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB  to follow the projectiles.    The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4  km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,  and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test  they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it  had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but  I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).    There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this  gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=  4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.    This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically  a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-  sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of  100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg  useful payload to orbit.

Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science  Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.       Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space  Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell  International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world  authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or  coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial  materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David  Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.       Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal  experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build  the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a  potential to power the globe.       For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half  from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific  concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.       The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar  surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted  through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous  source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever  increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

You are correct that executing PGP would be a violation (unless the patent  were declared invalid by the courts), but...  there is a question as  to when, how, or if distributing PGP would be a violation.  If the person  or company distributing PGP receives money for doing so, then it is  clearly a sale (for example, if it were on Compuserve, they charge you  for access so they would be selling PGP).  When there is no charge for  PGP things get less clear, but there would still be a reasonable view  that it is inducing an infringement.    > ...

This is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid  purpose for infringing a patent.  Although it is clear that in order to  create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing  a prior patent, one must perform research on an existing patent.  To  just say that you infringed a patent (assume we're not talking the RSA  patent) only for research purposes (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then never  develop any related invention (ie. only use it), would be a clear  infringement.    --   Glenn Tenney  voice: (415) 574-3420      fax: (415) 574-0546  tenney@netcom.com          Ham radio: AA6ER "

CORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH    ANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO   INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...    As we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw   the scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as   they ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to   journalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts   of the hills.    The Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING   of AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians   last week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death   or missing...     Seven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter   as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there   was a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer   ripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We   swung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon   under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.    We had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round   again, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a   valley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung   round again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired   repeated blasts.    Later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting   had landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed   enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in   fact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter.   I had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window,   its cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on   ""our side"". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a   search-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.    Our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two   M24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed   flying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second   crocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains   and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters   were there to give covering fire if necessary.    The operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet   armed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani   official told us that there were now five former Soviet military   helicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. ""They have   signed contracts to fly for us,"" he said. The helicopter we engaged   in combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian   pilot, but fighting for the Armenians.    We had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an   heated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer   white wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four   corpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an   Azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies   on the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back   towards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before   the plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.    Back at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the   civilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were   covered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor   mortis. They had been shot.    What did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave,   and the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY   DECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.

One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning  about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,  scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of  evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the  back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be  filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a  grave mistake to confuse these.

Rules such as ""support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and  controlled study"" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.  I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be  convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have  occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.

I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to  impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to  somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment  of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded  by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be  sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,  our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts  that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,  not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all  of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach  that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the  'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally  unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern  sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.  I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,  just because it has changed the way we strive.    BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.

0,"  This announcement is somewhat disconcerting; it doesn't do anything  evil in and of itself, but bodes badly for the future of open  algorithms and standards in information security.  I won't start  panicking until/unless DES or RSA or stuff like that is prohibited, but  I'm a little anxious.  (No doubt it won't be long before someone posts  explaining how this just a small part of some far-ranging and  long-lived NSA-PKP-IRS-FBI-CIA-HandgunControlInc-Clinton conspiracy to  subvert freedom, democracy, and mathematics.)  My feeling is that the  administration probably isn't that worried about things like DES and  RSA and PGP and RIPEM, since they'll never be used by a group much  wider than us computer geeks.    The fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things:    1.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, and it only just      now happened to be ``ready'' to release to the world at this time.    2.  The NSA has been working on this for a long time, but wasn't able      to get the Bush administration to go along with this plan.  (I      find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy      for the unescrowed use of cryptography; more likely the      administration felt that even escrowed, secret-algorithm and, for      all we know, trivially breakable cryptography should not be made      widely available.)    Thus said clipper@csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (Clipper Chip Announcement):  >This new technology will help companies protect proprietary  >information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations  >and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted  >electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the  >ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to  >intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.     The majority of the discussion involving this ""Clipper Chip"" seems to  pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  Does anyone  know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog  signals?  The language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.    The main thing I just don't get is whether this chip implements  symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques.  Anybody know?    I'm guessing symmetric, but they don't get very clear about it.  If it  is symmetric, how is it useful for anything other than link-level  encryption with an identical chip at each end?  How can you negotiate  a per-session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted  third party who knows your key?  (Or does it even use a per-session  key?)    If it's asymmetric, what about PKP's patents, which they claim cover  all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography?  Are they getting  royalties, or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the  algorithm secret? :-)  --  Marc VanHeyningen   mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu   MIME & RIPEM accepted  Kirk:  I won't hurt you.

The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction  the first poster's brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if I  should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal  size.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldn't this time, but  that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to,  but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that  next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this  was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I don't  get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I don't.      This isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a  different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work  that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some  people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor  their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet  like a hawk and use insulin regularly.

2,"  I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining  one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in  Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can  be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at  mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.    Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on the  outside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback with  integrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from file  geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much  of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The  white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte  Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)  pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting  can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass  properties of the Station change during assembly.    The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because  it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong  part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are  limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the  docking system.    The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional  launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit  (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never  had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to  (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual  de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the  residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from  impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a  Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating  the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing  further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,  it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the  nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.    The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment  Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used  for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system  which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a  controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we  did with Skylab).    The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be  used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity  on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device  for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on  one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.    This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,  data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work  done to date.    Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,  and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors  I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter  seems more likely.    Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;  you should see his notes in the GIF files.      Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for  anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

Incidentally, ""three times as heavy"" may be correct, as there is  serious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives than  to the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compares  wounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number of  wounded Arabs.  Guess why.    >was thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated  >throughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian  >population of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the  >battle began.

Was it not a state?    Yes because it has always had that power. The constitution limits the areas  in which the government can exercise power. The constitution can be changed  however and has been frequently. For example during prohibition the   government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state had  the capacity to change the constitution to enable this.    The constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictate  the manner in which power is exercised. No piece of paper can prevent  abuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidate  for opposing world war I - a clear breach of the first ammendment,    The United States clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful arms  control measures. If there were large groups of powerful warlords who could  prevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the power  of the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. This  is the situation in Somalia where the state is unable to govern because  the people with the guns think that they have the right to decide the  law.      |>>You have a very confused notion of what a state is.

The problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is which  date from the treaty of Westphalia to the medieval period where countries  were much more analogous to bodies like the EEC or the UN - organisations  where individual members had significant powers in their own right and  did not derive their power from a central authority.    |> The  |>canonical example of non-governmental law is probably the Law  |>Merchant, which others can expound upon better than I.  But it was  |>certainly enforced in non-state courts for some time, although state  |>courts, being subsidized, later were able to effectively enter the  |>arbitration business.    But here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. The rules  and regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state   was not involved in. Even today a great deal of law is effectively  made in this manner. For example the city of London stockmarket which is  a non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. It does so however  within the framework laid down by the government.    In medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. If  you were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw the  monarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very short  time. Most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit Royal  Charters, such as the Universities for example. Fairs and towns all required   authority in order to trade. It was customary however for this authority  to be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case of  misbehavior. After Magna Carta the monarch lost the power to remove  privillage without recourse to the courts. Tony Benn recently established  through a devious route the power of the Parliament to revoke favours  without recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolish  the house of lords for example.    Certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the   ""common law"" which has a very specific meaning in the UK. It is law  made by the judiciary through judgements on cases. Nothing else is  common law.      Incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. For  example a judgment in common law made in England can effect the   interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once in  the Empire, including the US, the reverse is also true. For example a  lot of the decisions surrounding AIDS cases in the US are of relevance  to UK decisions. Although the statues are different the reasoning that  lies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus if  a judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law in  one jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with no  guiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime which  they might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. The law  should be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions without  precedent. Once a decision is made in the UK though that naturally is   superior in UK law.

Let's take a little     stroll through a few of Elias Davidsson's contributions to our      understanding of the middle east.     ED> Quotations from Zionist leaders    ED> 1. ""There was no such thing as Palestinians""  ED> (Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, London Sunday   ED> Times, 15 June 1969)        And what do suggest that she meant by this?  Do you think she      meant that the Palestinians don't exist?

ED> (Israel Zangwill, The Voice of Jerusalem, London 1920,   ED> p.88)        When this was written, seventy three years ago, the people of      the region were not all Jews.  They are not all Jews now.  No      Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to      be ONLY for Jews.  That was true then.  It is true now.        ED> ""[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs.""  ED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to   ED> the Knesset,  ED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, 'Begin and the ""Beasts"", New   ED> Statesman, 25 June 1982)        Since you inserted the words 'The Palestinians are' we cannot      know what Begin was talking about.              For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an       absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'Center for Policy      Research,' you are not a very honest person.

ED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press,   ED> 1960, I., p.88)        Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he      has stated what is Israel's policy today?  Have you ever seen      Israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-Jews, let alone        actually try to remove non-Jews from Israel?  If you actually       believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel's non-      Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  But if you realize      that Israel has no intention of removing non-Jewish Israelis,      then you are nothing but a common liar.  This one time I will       give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid.        ED> ""We shall try to spirit the penniless population [the   ED> Palestinians] across the border by procuring employment   ED> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any   ED> employment in our own country""  ED> (Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, 1960,   ED> I, p.88)        Once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  You do      so within the context of modern day Israel.              Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.  How does this fact define the      United States today?      ED> ""[Jews] must expel Arabs and take their place""   ED> (David Ben Gurion, 1937, quoted in Shabtai Teveth, Ben   ED> Gurion and the Palestine Arabs, Oxford University Press,   ED> 1985, p. 89)        Did he say 'Jews,' or did you add this?

And by doing      so, you are misleading people into believing that Ben Gurion,      who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,      at the encouragement of people such as KING ABDULLAH, and the        MUFTI OF JERUSALEM, was gloating over people abandoning their      homes.  What he was refering to were the Arabs with whom Jews      were at war.

And      what was thought of and described as terrorism by Jews didn't      include slaughtering Olympic athletes, brutally murdering the       innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human       being for the sole reason that he or she is an Arab.        ED> ""The domination of Jewish agriculture by Arab   ED> workers is a cancer in our body""  ED> (A. Uzan, Israeli Minister of Agriculture, Ha'aretz, 13   ED> December 1974)        There were serious concerns about a work force that consisted       of people from OUTSIDE Israel.

Begin is dead.  And it      should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,      it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it      captured them.

It's true that we should never lose sight      of the plight of these people.  We should also recognize that      this quote preceded the disgusting wave of Arab terrorism and      violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with       the massacre of the Israeli athletes in Munich, and continues       to this day.        If your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do      so, truthseekers in this group would have a problem.

Historically, Friedman has been right.  It's really hard to develop  a good cypher.  IBM's Lucifer, the precursor to DES, turns out to have  been fatally flawed.  Most of the DES-like systems other than DES seem  to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  The first two tries at  public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  Most  if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were  broken eventually.  Attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption  have been disappointing; the classic ""A survey of data insecurity packages""  in Cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the  popular ""security packages"" of the late 1980s.            A new, proprietary algorithm?  No way.            If the US is permitting general export of this thing, it has  to be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  Currently there's  a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be  no problem; the 56 bits of DES are too many) or weak algorithms  (I think Word Perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.

0,"      Note:     The following was released by the White House today in            conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip            encryption technology.                               FACT SHEET                      PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT    The President has approved a directive on ""Public Encryption  Management.""  The directive provides for the following:    Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption  are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.   Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of  communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.   Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to  rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.   These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the  infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the  information age.    Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also  frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated  encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When  exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence  activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has  been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct  electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law  enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time  protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As  encryption technology improves, doing so will require new,  innovative approaches.    In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has  developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through  encryption that is substantially more robust than the current  government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed  to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys  will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information  only with appropriate legal authorization.    To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect  and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted  information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:    INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS    The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,  shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which  incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed  key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law  enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from  the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to  ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow  microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications  hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the  security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do  not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the  government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that  are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-  escrow system.    KEY-ESCROW    The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate  entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits  installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key  holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent  unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only  to government agencies that have established their authority to  acquire the content of those communications that have been  encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney  General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which  an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such  communications.    PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES    The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate  U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to  facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted  with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems  that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this  process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of  a final standard within six months of this directive.     The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to  the extent needed to preserve the government's ability to conduct  lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure  law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General  shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture  Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase. "

I don't know whether  the juice is homemade or from cans.    The following is my first encounter with the Chinese Restaurant  Syndrome.  Ten years ago, about an hour after having Won Ton Soup I  collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up, my scalp  tingling, my feet too weak to stand up.  The symptoms lasted for about  20 minutes.  Determined to find out the cause of my first reaction, I  went back to the Chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish.  The  same thing happened.  A quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing  out of the ordinary.    I've also had a mild attack after having soup at a Thai restuarant. "

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.  However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint  ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far  as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within  a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the  center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can  always hide a sufficiently small number of a different  type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming  that there is only one population of GRBs).    The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center  of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center  of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets  way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing  GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to  be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models  tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.    If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)  you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of  the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center  (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they  are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in  radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda  Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the  Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.    >my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering  >hyperspace :-)    The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't  see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.    >but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they  >are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered  >if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not  clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be  taken as describing what ""science is mainly about.""  Consider,  for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking  a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and  what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what  invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and  still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,  that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that  some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are  ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the  definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are  ""mainly about.""    The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient  context for people to understand my proposed definition.    > Okay, so let's see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees   > of certainty.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only  take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians  that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.      As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about  ""absolute scientific truth.""  I think it is more useful to talk  about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the  kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have  proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of  degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the  relevance of different kinds of evidence.      One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as  psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion  regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,  the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the  historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence  are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to  speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that  speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to  identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence  was presently available for them, and to describe how research  could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to  uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper  of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the  author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It  is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)    > The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to  > make this simple test.

I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --  deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When  proponents of some practice see no value in more careful  investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many  researchers' minds.      This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some  intersection between things that are worth investigating and  things that are advocated by those who seem careless or  unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can  understand why many scientists would just as soon select other  directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one  wants to become this generation's Rhine.    > One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely   > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn't   > been described in a scientific journal. ...    I think this is absurd.      > Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done   > (with favorable results), but it's apparently not acceptable because  > it's a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.    I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,  dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are  submitted to journals.

This thread began on SCA, when he and another guy claimed both Stalin  and Lenin were Jews. When I posted evidence from books and the Britannica  showing they were Christians, someone made the (correct) remark that  Lenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity.    To counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who, during his youth,  was trained to be a priest, Mr. Salah wrote ""yes, it says he was trained  to be a priest, but not for what religion!"" (BTW, Stalin developed  strong antisemitic feelings later in his life).    Mr. Salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against Jews by posting  antisemitic forgeries and trying to ""prove"" that certain notorious  people were Jews, even if they were not.      -Danny Keren.

Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either  caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and  passed.

Why? Says who? Why can mon & pop have FOA, but IBM be forced, and force is  the correct word here, to have REO?

Why does this tenant have an ""option"" (I won't call it a right) to destroy  the FOA of the landlord? If the landlord and the tenant can't agree, then they  both can cease from using each other's property.    Suddenly, by arm waving, by magic, a landlord does not have FOA. And on what  basis does the FOA of the landlord ""disappear""?    It seems that vague terms like ""no contact with tenants"" suffice.    Well, I think FOA is one our most important rightts (in the top 2-3), and by  golly, if the State is going to make it suffer, I sure would like to see the  heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right.    I don't think ""no contact"" with the tenats is even a crime, much less something  that should cause severe interference with important rights.        >I suspect that the majority of the people in this country      >agree with my position on these extreme cases, particularly      >if they are presented in this manner.

I assume that when you say ""publicly owned"", you are talking about those  quasi-State companys that do NOT have shareholders.    The companies on the Fortune 500, for example, are all privately owned. They  can give you a list of all of their owners.

FOA can be derived by any two rational people, on a basis that neither has  evil, malicious, or murderous intent towards the others.    In short, agreement is mutual, or not at all.    Your REO on the other hand, lives only by accepting coercion, the gun, into  the situation. And that is self-destructive of the whole argument, because it  is based only on might makes right. Sort of like saying, ""nobody has a right  to live"", whereupon I whip out a gun and shoot you dead -- end of argument.      --   There are actually people that STILL believe Love Canal was some kind of  environmental disaster.

On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahine  and Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office,  Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab Director  Dr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, and  felt ""like royalty,"" he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt to  explain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate  dimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, ""because while  I'm most interested in those things in space that are farther  away, I know that here is where the first steps are taken.""       Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate  students and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium,  as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of  Flight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer's project  scientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.       Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid  to a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should  extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted,  they would find a variety of images that would explain something  of Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with  the spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.       Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes  describing the project and the spacecraft's features. In answer  to a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed  drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, ""it's only  a concept."" Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five  years before, described the professor as ""a living miracle of the  power of the brain. He's miraculous, and he has such a good sense  of humor.""       The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data  visualization in Section 384's Digital Image Animation Lab,  entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles  to view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong  showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been  discovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about  its composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he  asked several questions on their interpretation.       Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data  Acquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations  Facility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.       The day ended with two technical discussions of particular  interest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank  Estabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described  a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.  Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the  philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.       The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern  California for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and  planned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab  tour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised  Chahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.                            ###       ___    _____     ___      /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov      | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |   ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand  /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and  |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

I'm currently looking at a copy of last   Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders  ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is  a part in the middle which rather prominently says ""WANTED: We pay  cash for assault rifles and pistols."". Granted, I haven't seen today's  paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it.  It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers)  anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.    By the way, let me put in a plug for Traders. I have shopped all  over the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lower  prices.

If you were to move     onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have     to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,       How many people do you want to share the colony with?          What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?           Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave     from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young     enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.    I didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.  Thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.          Here's the (edited) responses I got:         How many people do you want to share the colony with?     100       What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?

Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the  percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there  were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.  And everyone, especially me, likes to ""go exploring""...I would want to be able  to go for a walk and see something different each time...    =============================================================================    For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enough  to have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town  ""everybody knows everything"" syndrome, which some people like but  I don't.  Call it several thousand people.    For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough  to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time  getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough  for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that  5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

1,"  Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                       LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE    [AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty --   and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with   the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]    Dear Adrian:      I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to   your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and   generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist   mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back   with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present   now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the   future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.      There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger   of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan.   10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition,   shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic   rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll   limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent   with your note.      First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't   alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my   interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.      Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't   support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions   anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older   body of lies, omissions, and distortions.      Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on   countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND   BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this   present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.      Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is   a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,   and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic   process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat   (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you   should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in   designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our   ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree   on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30   years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.    More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s   clearly indicate the contrary.      Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human   behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far  too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The   attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the   resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.      Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is   a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil,   and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic   process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates   figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but   basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social   benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a   criminal offense.      Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials   quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are   many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless   because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a   natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and   Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process   nor to arguments grounded in social utility.      And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it   wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that   anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however,   whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's   permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists   themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed   people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".    Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity""   viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate,   ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in   the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys,   and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we   probably manufacture at least that many every year.    The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly   aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what   their real motives are.      Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way,   it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic;   the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the   self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing   this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a   quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life""   of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna   be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.    As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law   provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I   will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is   that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands   -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can   only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given   both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics   and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.      So what's the point?      L.

An article in yesterday's Atlanta  Journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the   data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is  faulty. The point that the article made is that all long term temperature  dataa collected has been in urban areas, and that any heat rise can be  attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area. They called it  the ""asphalt temperature trend"". We have no real long term data on remote  areas, such as the middle of the Amazon rain forest, or the top of Mt. Everest  or the Gobi desert, for that matter. An accompanying article mentioned that  a group of scientists at NASA had developed a method for using a satellite  to collect temperature data globally, and that preliminary results showed  a slight downward trend attributed to the Mt Pinatubo eruption. It went  on to say that even with the current downward trend, there appeared to be  *NO* change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at  least the next 50 years.

Pick up a list of the Labor parties proposals  for MK prior to the election and pay attention to the order.  Correlate this  with the number of Arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.  Further correlate this with the voting results from Arab areas.    Lo and behold, you will discover that Israeli Arab Labor party members  did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of  Arab candidates.  This problem is further exacerbated by the rifts  between Israeli Arabs.  Some claim membership to right wing parties  while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.    I worked within the labor party during the late 70's elections (not this  last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that  were returned from the local delegates elected.  At the time, the system  was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there  was no massive effort to lobby for Arab reps. by their own delegates.    |> Exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the Labour party  |> has never put an Arab into a Cabinet post and insists its coalition  |> members do the same?

Quite simply, if all eligible Arab voters became members of the Labor  party and voted, they would be able to command more than %15 of  the delegates.  This is a power base that can not be ignored!  Especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again  due to lack of political power).  I have seen how the labor party  works from the inside and my experience has been that, as in most  political situations, the MKs act out of their own self-interest.    And to answer your question, I ""broke"" with labor because I felt  that they were heeding too much to the right-wing and ultra-orthodox  coalition members.    |> >From ""The OTHER Front"", July 29, 1992.

In drumming up support for his seat, MK [?] would not be averse to  using this argument, or it could be used on his behalf.

One of these days you'll learn that the way to stop Israel  from fighting back is to stop attacking.  If there were no attacks in  the security zone for a year because the Lebanese army could maintain  the peace, then Lebanon would be in much better shape.    	Tell me something, though.  Why do Syrian troops not get  attacked?  Aren't they occupying Lebanon?    	Israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two  conditions.  One is a demonstration that the Lebanese army can keep  the peace.  The second is that the Syrians pull out as well.

But you've picked the wrong topic if you think a few  rigged ""quotations"" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir  Yassin ""massacre.""    You have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.  At the most basic level, you should know that there is a big  difference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding  ""quotations"" that support your preset opinions.    If you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that  many of the sources of your ""quotations"" have an axe to grind, and  therefore you must be very careful about whom you ""quote.""  For  example, Meir Pa'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,  and a war hero.  But that doesn't mean everything that comes out of  his mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience  shows), Pa'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his  anti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be  considered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of  course you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy  ""quotation"" that you can use to attack Israel.    Benny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a ""scholar""  when he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.  It's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an  attack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at  the section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,  you will see his ""indictment"" to be pure hot air.  And this is the  BEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning  evidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as  ""scholarly,"" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see  that his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.    The Deir Yassin ""massacre"" never took place as the propagandists  tell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila ""massacres."" Do you get  the feeling people like to blame the Jews for ""massacres,"" even if  they have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews  like to do it, for reasons of their own.    Please, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin ""massacre"" stuff  with facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version  unless you find something serious to contradict it.    Vic "

One very interesting thing I notice about this is that the only use of  the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field.  It is not used at all by the encryption algorithm.    It seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be  otherwise compatible, but would send out a bogus law enforcement field.  This might render the device unusable with ""normal"" devices if there's  some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field, but it  could certainly be used with other such modified devices.    Of course, this is irrelevant if the NSA has a backdoor in the  algorithm, but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system.    --  Wilt thou seal up avenues of ill?

0,"  Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.    First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the  Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:    The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs  general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB  ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm  consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data  seems to be 64 Bit? Yes.  So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when   Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key.   (Or is it one key per direction ?)  They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.  Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip  which is now ready to work.  The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit's), and 160 Key-Bits.  These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number  with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)  At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)  before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper  chip put's out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,  and the session key. This might look like  X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}  where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.  This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)  After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet  being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.    Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160  Bit's.    Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not  being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this  scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.    As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the   obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing  the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can't  imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources  for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.    Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security  could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits  each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let's simply  assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can't be fooled by criminals or  law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows  and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on  and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding  chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].  How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that  the police (or whoever) want's to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode  this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this  after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,  but I guess politics will not work that way.    Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes  of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-  cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes  the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who  is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-  cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company  to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far  as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-  company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key  will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable  by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!    What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the  first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session  key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn't be so  difficult to do *that* :^)    And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about  Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems  to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!      Now an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am  talking about!!!

Even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the  writer is referring to, it should be incumbent on Mr. Erwin to back up what  he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.  (For example, ""Simon Zealotes"" = the certain apostle having a nickname  connected to a Jewish terrorist group)    	Even Josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to  Christians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the Jewish  Christian Church in Jerusalem, even though he took the time to  record the death of St. James (brother of St. John). On the subject of the  fate of Jesus's family, including James (the brother of Jesus) we learn  nothing from Josephus.    	Likewise, Tacitus condemns the Jews as being a particularly   vicious people, getting many of the facts about Jewish history wrong in  the process.

I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd  assert that I claimed they were truth.    : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.        Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the   difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26   years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.  So it would have been an Army cover-up.

1,"    I don't want to attack anyone's personal opinions and thus have not  included any articles - but it seems to me incredibly ridiculous  and pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight  and point fingers at Clinton, Reno, the FBI, or whomever.    First of all, it is a knee-jerk judgement.  The facts are quite  muddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while.    Secondly, things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory  fingers.  Pointing fingers is a destructive action.  If everyone  sat around pointing fingers all the time, nothing would get done  and nothing would ever get any better.  And despite the tragedy,  we can learn something from this - if it is approached in a   constructive manner.  Doesn't it seem that working together is  more productive than working against one another?    Thirdly, it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given  the benefit of hindsight - something that those who made the  decisions did not have the benefit of.  Why not give them the courtesy  of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the  data they had - in a very, very difficult situation.

The 27th was a short day at  work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided  to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal  Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had  walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes  behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24  Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the   car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,  and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and   her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to   45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help  them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?    When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,   but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the   Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle  around it. I ask, ""What's going on?"" Someone tells me, ""Come listen."" Well  they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: ""Brother  Muslims, our time has come . . . "" and something else along that line. I  didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to   get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.   New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And  the comments started: ""Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!"" and ""There's  no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us."" I even heard that: ""All   Moscow is behind us."" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this   was no joke. I quietly left and went home.    Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,   that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of   things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.    My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.   I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two  o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and   shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,  like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a   demonstration and move slowly.    My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some  outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd  people are shouting ""Down with the Armenians!"" and ""Death to the Armenians!"" I  waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street   on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned   and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26   Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there   was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same   kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside   from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young  people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.    My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of  uneasy and said, ""No, let's stay at home instead."" An hour went by, or maybe   an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say  exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on  the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.    I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,  and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time   there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more   aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.  They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run   again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I   followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was   leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one   side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square   and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There   was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.  I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. ""We don't need   perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been."" Now what did they   mean by ""living like we have been?"" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.   But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense   of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just   in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it   anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.    Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'   apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't   hear them say ""kill them"" over the microphone, I only heard ""beat them and   drive them out."" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then  another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off  to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and   I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.  There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try   to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.    Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no  demonstration, and I had to protect my family.    I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next  to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-  lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-  thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because  after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons  in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City   Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I   saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the   cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15   to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried   off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing  right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe   about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.   When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was   about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He   has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I   have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of   people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled   around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.    Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.   I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,   I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.   And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the   street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,   which had ""Ermeni oryum"" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means ""Death to   Armenians!"" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really  know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is  Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark  blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His   family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on   Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;   their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the   left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a   new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son   was carrying a flag that said ""Death to Armenians!"" I was surprised because   before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being   done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.    Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, ""It's OK, it'll pass,   they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up."" Naturally I didn't   want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And   this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't   see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't   handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking   and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and   hashish to put in a store window!    So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one   would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,   the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't   breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.   True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-  vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people   died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I   couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be   specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of   Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.    When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: ""Let's go upstairs.""   We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the   evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.  I stopped at ""The Corner,"" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I   look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to   the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.   The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed   toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,   wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as   though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more   noise, and the glass was flying again.    We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,  there was really no way to defend yourself there.    In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.   On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or   what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the   bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying   there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing  you couldn't even see him.    That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to  	develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise  	probably become illegal pretty quickly here...    It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's needed  is a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codec  functions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.    You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and have  a good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in the  middle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on  a byte stream.    With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work.   Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.    At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible  modems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on  the cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to get  the price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nasty  home RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I bought  for 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software  (which I don't).    The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -  the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.  Economics, I'm afraid.    However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even with  the bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)  and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speech  over a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should start  thinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatible  for everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet for  all our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]    G "

Currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites    is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who    has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment.     Including anonymized mail, Usenet posting, and return addresses     (no encryption).  Send mail to help@penet.fi for information.       Hal Finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk    remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):    pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. See also scripts.tar.Z (UNIX    scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (MSDOS batch files to    aid remailer use).      ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu    -----------------------------      Anonymized mail.  Request information from above address.          elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu    -------------------------      Experimental anonymous remailer run Karl Barrus      <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU>, with encryption to the server.  Request      information from that address.          hal@alumni.caltech.edu    ----------------------      Experimental remailer with encryption to server and return      addresses.

Include header `Request-Remailing-To'.      nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu     ----------------------      Experimental remailer allowing one level of chaining.  Run by      Chael Hall.  Request information from above address.      phantom@mead.u.washington.edu     -----------------------------      Experimental remailer with encryption to server.  `finger' site      address for information.      Notes    =====        - Cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often      running without site administrator knowledge. Liability issues      are wholly unresolved.        - So far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and PGP      software (see the question on cryptography).       - Encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)      vary between sites.      - Multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are      mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.    _____  <8.2> What are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?          Users    -----      - Use anonymity only if you have to. Frivolous uses weaken the      seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.    - Do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.    - Do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on      Usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.    - If posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.      Remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases      network traffic.    - Avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of Usenet; this      is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. The `alt'      hierarchy is preferred.    - Give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.      references, etc.) Remember that content is the only means for      readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any      inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even      future ones under the same handle.    - Be careful not to include information that will reveal your      identity or enable someone to deduce it.  Test the system by      sending anonymized mail to yourself.    - Be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them.       Be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.    - Be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.    - ``Hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.      Use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.    - Be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large      amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating      his hardware, all for your convenience.      Operators    ---------      - Document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an      introductory file that is sent to new users.  Have a coherent and      consistent policy and stick to it. State clearly what logging and      monitoring is occurring. Describe your background, interest, and      security measures. Will the general approach be totalitarian or      lassaiz-faire?    - Formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate      potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. What if a user      is blackmailing someone through your service? What if a user      posts suicidal messages through your service? Remember, your      users trust you to protect them.    - In the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations      where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.      warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke      the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)    - Describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.      Address the bandwidth limitations of your site. Report candidly      and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  Work closely with      users to isolate and fix bugs. Address all bugs noted below under      ``(in)stability of anonymity''.    - Document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?      What compromises have occured? Why are you running it? What is      your commitment to it?    - Include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  Include an      address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item.       Consult a lawyer about your liability.    - Be committed to the long-term stability of the site. Be prepared      to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  If you      do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system      adminstrator, consult those who do and are.    - Be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  If      possible, query group readers.    - Keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message      format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  Ensure      the key text `Anon' is  somewhere in every header.    - Take precautions to ensure the security of the server from      physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.      Readers    -------        - Do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason      that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that      equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail      anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its      volume is heavy or increasing).    - React to the anonymous information unemotionally.  Abusive posters      will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate      responses.  Sometimes the most effective response is silence.    - Notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,      harassment, extortion, etc.    - Do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they      offend you personally.    - Use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the      idea of anonymity itself.    - Avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings      should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or      `conceivable' need exists.      References    ----------        See e.g. ftp.eff.org:/pub/academic/anonymity:      > This article is an excerpt from an issue of FIDONEWS on individual    > privacy and the use of handles.  It accepts the need of a system    > operator to know the name of a user; but suggests that the use of    > a handle is analogous to a request to withhold the name in a    > letter to the editor.

James Thomas Green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:      > Try putting this in your kill file:    >       >   /Anon/h:j    >   /Anonymous/h:j    >     > This will search the headers of the messages and kill any that    > contain `Anon' or `Anonymous' in them.  Not perfect and won't    > kill followups.         Note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask    anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so    far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common    as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.      _____  <8.4> What is the history behind anonymous posting servers?      Originally anonymous posting services were introduced for    individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is    almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion    and alt.sex.bondage.  One of the first was one by Dave Mack    started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. Another early one was    wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by Stephanie Gilgut (Gilgut Enterprises)    but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  The system provided    anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (John Opalko) took up    the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous    alias file. The group ``alt.personals has been chewing through    servers like there's no tomorrow.''        Spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in    researching the idea, Karl Kleinpaste    <Karl_Kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system    from scratch in six hours. By this time the idea of extending the    server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,    and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by    multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``The intended    advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group    support, with a single anon identifier across all.  This was    arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.''     K. Kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an    anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus    against it.       K. Kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to    `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and    used this in three cases. Nevertheless, after a few months of    intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his    server. ``Even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to    abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the    facilities staff here. Such abuses started right after it was    created.''      In ~Nov 1992, Johan Helsingius (julf@penet.FI) set up the most    controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on    scripts and C code written by K. Kleinpaste and supports anonymized    mail, posting, and return addresses. He initially wanted to confine    the service to Scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide    accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.        J. Helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every Usenet    newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological    opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).    Because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,    abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than    ``routine'' abuses. His total commitment to preservation of    anonymity is also controversial.      For example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~Feb    1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate    crew dialogue during the Challenger shuttle disaster via    anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. Despite that the transcript had been    posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then    non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a    New York news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of    vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating    through many newsgroups.         The original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded    that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''    suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was    not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of    the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived    association with the item.  The ensuing commotion generated queries    for the original article by late-entering readers. The anonymous    user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his    detractors.      Despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal    opposition and verbal abuse of K. Kleinpaste and eminent news    operators, J. Helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire    extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the    scope of the service. As of ~March 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is    best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users    in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a    day, and approximately 5% of all Usenet postings are anonymized    through the site. The immense popularity is probably largely due    to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to    find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.      Johan Helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to    dismantle his server in ~Feb 1993. At one point K. Kleinpaste    threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate    news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages    originating from the site.  J. Helsingius has also alluded to    threats of flooding the  server.  The server has crashed several    times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it    by an anonymous user.  Mr. Helsingius reports spending up to 5    hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the    service's administration. In response to the serious threats he    disabled global group access temporarily for one week and    encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.        Based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by    ``cypherpunks,'' J. Helsingius has identified many security    weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is    currently in the process of code development and testing. He is    planning on upgrading the IBM compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon    to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new    system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple    email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,    etc.      A very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in Dec.    1992 by D. Clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography    in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of    confidentiality seen so far.  However, it was running on a public    access account, and he had to shut it down after only several    weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately    originating from NSF representatives. D. Clunie has released the    software to the public domain.      Recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on    government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and    group formation is currently underway.  In the basic scenario the    group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,    and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable    digital signatures. The traffic may eventually reach reporters in    the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to    attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing    easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and    encryption.

This is another one of your wet dreams.    Unlike many countries, Israel does allow reporters in and out of the O.T.   That is what the problem is. If Israel were a country like China, then   nothing would transpire from what is happening in the O.T. But there  seems to be a proliferation of journalists in Israel always trying to show  how evil the Israeli monster is. Arab countries don't allow journalists   anywhere, we have yet to hear about the massacres of Kurds, the destruction  and annihilation of Hama, the killings of moslem fundamentalists in mosques  in Egypt and Algeria etc...

So far, Israe   continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they   leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that   the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a  reduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....  and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------    Tim:     There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The  first is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so  there is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in   exchange for pieces of paper, ""expectations"", ""hopes"", etc. The second  is that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that  these ""tangible concessions"" be made by Israel **without** it receiving  anything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances  seems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns  for its expected concessions. By ""tangible"" is meant something that  1) provides Israel with ""comparable"" protection (from the land it is to   give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine   **will be** accountable and held actively (not just ""diplomatically)   responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens   or ""visitors"").    In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian  statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel  was assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to**   co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel   from its territory.  	Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,  	how *could* such ""guarantees"" be instilled? For example,  	how could such ""guarantees""/""controls"" be added to the  	Palestinian PISGA proposals?    Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute  it lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more ""buffer zone"", gives  full autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties  could (and *would*, if not ""controlled"" somehow) EASILY return to the   traditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*  ensure that that will not happen.    Tim   "

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate  project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars  in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop  your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against  your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.

You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch  system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on  exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project  start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,  the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want  speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in  service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less  than 18 months after the development go-ahead.    One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief  that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending  billions of dollars.  It isn't true and never was. "

The misadventure began on Feb. 28 when  100 agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-  bacco and Firearms storemd the compound, intent  on seizing Koresh and a cache of automatic weap-  ons.  Four agents and an estimated  six cult mem-  bers died inteh ensuing gun battle.  Earlier  oppor-tunities to isolate and arrest Koresh outside the  complex had not been adequately explored.  	Authorities prepared a siege and resolved that  those deaths would be the last.  Fifty-one days into   the siege there was no public outcry to storm the  compound.  	It had been correctly perceived that the chil-  dren inside ""Rancho Apocalypse"" were essentially   hostages.  With their lives at stake, there was no  reason for the government to be impatient.  The  government's superior firepower, control of water  and utilities and freedom of movement created the  conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.  	Neither Attorney General Janet Reno nor the  FBI has provided a sigle compelling reason for  abandondoning the course of patience.  	If intelligence was accurate and Koresh was  growing increasingly violent and bizarre, it is diffi-  cult to see how a tear-gas attack launched by an  M-60 combat vehicle would clear his mind.  If re-  ports of escalating child abuse were accurate, they  would have to be weighted against the potential for  eve ngreated hamr.      etc etc tec....  [paragraphs, 2.5 paragraphs deleted]    But some of the responsibility rests with Clinton,  and inexperienced president who did not pay  enough attention to the life-and -death decisions  being made on WAco.  	If Reno is to be faulted for anything, ti would  be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en-  forcement officers--a common problem among  prosecutors.  	Full investigations into th eWaco tragedy must  be conducted by both the executive and legislative  branches.  The first step is to verify how the blaze   started.  Though apportioning blame will play a   role, it is of greater importnace to find strategies  to elude the fire next time.    [end of editorial]  -J. Case Kim  kim39@husc.harvard.edu   "

Will anybody    A typical Armenian revisionist. As in the past in x-Soviet Armenia,   and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and idiotic causes the Armenians  brought havoc to their neighbors. A short-sighted and misplaced  nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda and anachronistic methods  the Armenians continue to become pernicious for the region. As usual,  they will be treated accordingly by their neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag   is a mountainous enclave that lies completely within Azerbaijan with   no border or history whatsoever connected to x-Soviet Armenia. Besides   the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is the historic homeland and   the 'cradle' of the artistic and literary heritage of Azerbaijan, which   renders the Armenian claims preposterous, even lunatic. No one in his or   her mind could have imagined that one day such a devious turn of event   could have plagued the Azeris. One cannot even imagine the reverse case   to occur, for the Armenians either would have slaughtered the Azerbaijanis,   or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. Where was she?                      An Appeal to Mankind    During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational  population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of  the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights  guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human  Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,  documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.    The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan  though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to  guarantee life and peace.    The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's  tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against  Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied  and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.    Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly  deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.  Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also  been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.  Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives   of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central  Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee  them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.    One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against  Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the  Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific  experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection   of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.    We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,  for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are  violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,  its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of  Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over   the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the  USSR and the United States.     One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and  generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance  while the truth is that all these shootings and recent   events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on  Azerbaijan.    It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there  were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the  issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly  and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their  representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan  SSR.    We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we   are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one  of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic   Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.    But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the  Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists  encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000  Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the   neighboring lands.    The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,  suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.    But what about the lives of seven million human beings?  If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are  less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their   colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other  attributes?    All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers  for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal  of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous  appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope  that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda  will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and  stimulate at least as much help and compassion for  Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.    		THE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE'S HELP TO                   KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES                   OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR      ""PAINFUL SEARCH ..""    THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians  in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about  600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the  four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.    The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials  and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid  workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.    The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of  the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control  of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations  in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting  retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the  dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first  suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.  Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken  Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000  dead.    The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a  15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  ""Hojali  Disaster"", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on  preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman  Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in  the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more  than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700  dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman  of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.    FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International  Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of  Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque  from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. ""We  did  not count  the  bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,"" Mr  Zen Ruffinen said. ""We have some idea since we gave the body bags  and products to wash the dead.""    Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the  number of  dead in the  massacre. ""Don't  get worked up.  It will  take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,"" the  43-year-old  lawyer said at his small office.    Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to  reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714  wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist  uprising in Baku in January 1990.    Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power  three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly  what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70  miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.    Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being  the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the  republic's forensic department. ""This  is just a small percentage  of the dead,"" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic  scientist. ""They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the  chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury  our dead within 24 hours.""    Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14  years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and  axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland  snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of  deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises  cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's  report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those  believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.    Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still  disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six  policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the  names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The  most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far  comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a  helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27  February.    ""There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to  count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream  and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,"" Mr  Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter  pilot.    ""People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and  one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was  pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but  Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to  return.""    There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in  circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few  months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali  at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages  taken over by Armenian forces.    THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92      HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES    AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the  Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in  his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of  Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.    ""I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,""  the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the  Hojali disaster. ""I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to  be alive.""    Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity  for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12  days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the  2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the  edge of Karabakh.    ""At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard  before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy  machine-guns, the lot,"" Mr Sadikov said.    Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction  of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started  fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the  snow into a forest on the other side.    To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam  about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,  until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two  Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.    ""None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by  a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening  fire,"" Mr Sadikov said.    Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward  to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts  were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his  group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman  son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his  67-year-old elder brother.    ""I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,""  he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. ""We  have never got any of the bodies back.""    The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.  One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he  struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's  crossing, Mr Sadikov said.    Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and  several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy  hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three  Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.    As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was  little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was  soon to flee.    ""The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian  rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,"" Mr Sadikov said. ""I  had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.  They even found a bullet in my sock.""    Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the  Hojali massacre in February  (left).

Without getting into the *really* *thorny* questions about reverse  engineering and all of that, let me just point out that there already  exist gate arrays and suchlike that have what's known as a security fuse  which can be programmed after you've verified all other programming --  this makes it impossible to read out the programming of the device  (again, ignoring the reverse engineering questions).

Guns on the other hand are not essential in Norway, so we don't   argue that IF we 'banned' guns we HAVE to ban cars.....

My personal experience, and I have the same   history an build you do (related to the heart, that is), is that my PVC's  come and go, with some months causing anxiety.  Taking on more fluids  seems to help, and they seem worse in the summer.  Remember that a slow   heart rate will allow more PVC's to be apparent, so perhaps it is an   indication of a healthy cardiac system (but ask an expert about that  last point, especially)    Good luck, hope we don't die of arrhythmias.

1,"    Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.  After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided  that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant  posting.    *** file follows ***     Hi Folks;    As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it  kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the  Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.    Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other  legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things  start today.    More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen  Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the  courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, ""Who stands  trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)  Weaver?""  On the evening news she said, ""I am here protesting  because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.  I thought we all did.""  Nice sound bite (grin)!    The news reporter also interviewed some guy named ""Tim""  who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the  guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he  expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.  ""Tim"" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver  and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop  telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know  the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law  against political activity within X feet of a courthouse  or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).    Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed  an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam  FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.

Theory of one-way hash functions, distinctions of   terms. MD4 and MD5. Snefru.  X-Last-Updated: 1993/04/16    Archive-name: cryptography-faq/part07  Last-modified: 1993/4/15      FAQ for sci.crypt, part 7: Digital Signatures and Hash Functions    This is the seventh of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are  mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.  We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.  Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.    The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu   as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography   FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.      Contents:    * What is a one-way hash function?  * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?  * What are MD4 and MD5?  * What is Snefru?      * What is a one-way hash function?      A typical one-way hash function takes a variable-length message and    produces a fixed-length hash. Given the hash it is computationally    impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't    determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not    even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also    computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the    same hash.      A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an    encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash    function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are    relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user    is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,    and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the    signature can do the same thing.      Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.    * What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?      There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a    very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which    isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it    a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption    functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have    hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1    if and only if X = H(M).      A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private    decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the    previous question, have public hashing and public verification.    Digital signature functions have private hashing and public    verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,    but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.      Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to    be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real    difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key    isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend    rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing    ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.    * What are MD4 and MD5?      MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.    Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is    available from [FTPMD].      Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft    RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some    people refer to it as MD5.    * What is Snefru?      Snefru is a family of message digest functions developed by Ralph    Merkle. Snefru-8 is an 8-round function, the newest in the family.    Definitions appear in Merkle's paper [ME91a]. Code is available from    [FTPSF]. "

While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF,   from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for   strong cryptography through a distinct organization.    The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex  and pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the  contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged  models) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin  already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one  step removed from the old ""crypto-wielding child molester"" argument.  An  EFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the  connection to child pornography and the like.    Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In  light of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it  stands to be labelled as ""communist"", ""anarchist hackers"", radical, etc.      I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social  Responsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical  antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political  baggage.    Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography  would best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing  group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to  advocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's  question: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going  to do about it?    Having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,  I would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:  gathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the  issue as well as the First-Amendment side.

0,"    This may be a stupid question, but how does the government know which keys  to ask for?    Will owners be required to REGISTER their phones, faxes, modems, etc.,  and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number?  Will there be penalities if the public does not do this?  Will identification  (the National Health Care ID, perhaps) be required when purchasing a  Clipper-equipted phone?    Or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of  a conversation?  Identification which could be used to automatically  log who calls whom?  (The _phone_ company keeps records, but this   information would be accessable by a well-placed van near a microwave  relay station).    This raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications  encryption key.  Will it be something that is derived from information  exchanged at the start of the conversation -- and hence derivable by  an eavesdropper?    --   Bear Giles  bear@fsl.noaa.gov "

1,"  For those of you interested, I just finished talking with a   representative of Senator Bob Krueger's reelection campaign about his   position on the RTKBA.  Krueger was appointed by the  Democratic Governor   of Texas to complete Lloyd Bentsen's unexpired term.    The representative said that Senator Krueger did not have a position and   would only comment on specific legislation that was pending.  No comment   was available on the various versions of the Brady Bill.    Be warned and vote accordingly. "

As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993""   (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space   business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.      In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had   shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are   driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are   projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7   satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also   projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,   and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to   $450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward   revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                                Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,   revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to   increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from   broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products   and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad   report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite   manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth   $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual   projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market   sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very   successful in regaining international market share in the satellite   business.      Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in   the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-  year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including   such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)   appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually   publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and   the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released   then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if   the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the   numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.      Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite   promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top   $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct   broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite   station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year   through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic   for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for   substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the   next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative   assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and   satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the   current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite   market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will   be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive   as currently projected.)      It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first   release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research   facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for   the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space   Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first   sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]     2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS     McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta   launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola   Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to   launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO   communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas   was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.      The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium   constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium   satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be   launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle   launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be   launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.    Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a   planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although   details of the launch services contract were reported to be   negotiation, and not yet final.      The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of   their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5   million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36   launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These   launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global   Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other   programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is   expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected   to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.    Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand""   services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to   occur within 40 days of the request.       [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should   provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program   through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have   a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and   sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts   for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA   Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping   MDC as a viable commerical launch company.       However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these   contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has   not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for   operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing   and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these   approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.    But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.      Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of   several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of   the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III   program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this   time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future   funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts   is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy   reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and   Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs   (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter""   program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget   deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to   find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]      3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""     The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing   satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of   Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to   WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and   operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral   images of the Earth.      [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture   by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the   operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the   request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new   venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to   provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into   digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable   customers for this service include exploration geologists,   agricultural planners, and urban planners.       It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the   1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last   November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote   sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to   this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to   all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures   would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.      There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote   sensing ventures working their way through the system at different   stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite   systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing   data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,   government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures   such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use   innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the   margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures   appearing in the next year or so.]                      4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT""      Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General   Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,   despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent   analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever   convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical   95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-  generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate   management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are   cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and   $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of   capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.      [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has   hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has   restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,   many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might   be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space   Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current   problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected   to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of   about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space   launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability   of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits   from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur   program is back on track, this division will continue to show   substantial losses.      In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation   is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.    To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional   management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.    In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management   team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with   the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would   indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch   operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince   customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would   have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in   marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for   this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly   McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash   flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction   (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),   or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the   $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of   change for any company.]      5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND     Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is   projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early   February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which   detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the   next decade.      Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant   position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54   international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane   holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14   contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long   March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.      Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can   compete are projected to come from communications satellites with   the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and   scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand   growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.      Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of   individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will   continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with   larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.   Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications   satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to   about 3000 kg in GEO.      Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain   strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the   decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace   bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder   demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques   appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing   or near-term transponders.      One of the significant possible changes in the market was   identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian   launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,   investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade   off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and   other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities   and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.      [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and   I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.    Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in   the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new   data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical   transponders on orbit.     I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-  based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While   fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the   established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing   demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-  multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space   transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability   service, but only from established point A to established point B.   To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable   between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,   installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost   millions or billions of dollars.       For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground   network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective   solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is   cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of   thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite   network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and   has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is   growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,   it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to   handle the increase in traffic.      Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still   growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But   satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current   generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of   on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from   last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch   demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite   launches over longer intervals.      And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it   looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-  supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual   commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites   per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up   to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of   about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,   Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other   systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per   year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.      We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial   launches.]    6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT      The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has   spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety   rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt   the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation   of range safety rules.       In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of   two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure   typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at   Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute   before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was   overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the   communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the   valid abort call.      Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort   command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an   investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to   launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.      Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety   Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This   investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an   incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their   investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at   lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used   in the launch.     [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an   investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested   by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space   Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.       At the time of writing this column, some of the initial   investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are   starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four   different communications channels were in use during the test. After   the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test   director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops   Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.    According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.   Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the   NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying   the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing   explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the   best set being that clear lines of communications and clear   definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and   understanding of the mission rules were not established before the   launch.       As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these   procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.     This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has   been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they   do with commercial aircraft problems).       I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with   procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance   of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how   specific lines of authority should be delineated.]     7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED     Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new   small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.    Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos""   winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"",   launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is   projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to   an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430   kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used   with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called   'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military   establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of   spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the   Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia   facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.      [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new   venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking   for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house   knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous   commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.      This one's a little different in that they are offering variants   of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being   targeted or substantial financial backing.]    8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING     In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the   results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial   rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland   Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary   study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch   site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected   low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic   considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal   for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.      [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the   Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still   proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland   found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if   substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected   returns were too low to justify the cost of development.       This might point out some key discriminators in judging the   feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:    - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage   sufficient to recover setup costs?    - Is there a market advantage of using the site?    - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?    - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the   investment?       Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at   Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore   Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against   these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying   on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]    9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING     In one of his last official acts, former President Bush   authorized space technology transfer for several joint space   ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed   use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that   regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch   vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first   launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as   a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into   LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,   including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.    Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in   development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor   launch vehicle as well as from the US.      [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity   in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small   payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either   Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.    However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout   program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the   Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on   system).       This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch   system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of   such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies   have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche   Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the   Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to   find any other European development work with even a rumor of   funding for hardware.      Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the   Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting   rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space   launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled   the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.      What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally   transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new   civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de   Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described   as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket   program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German   firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq   in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and   tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package   lagged that of the propulsion system.      It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first   scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B   satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes   cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has   yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air   launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this   contract.]     10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP     PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in   late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract   from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2   launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar   Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish   Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and   offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According   to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya   launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-  enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like   the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main   alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service   to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the   Swedish satellite was not specified.      [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and   funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a   small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From   PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series   rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar   MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a   225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.       PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its   first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and   2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired   TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary   engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder   closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same   building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,   launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.   Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the   board of directors.       PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least   $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been   searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to   design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.      The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help   bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need   much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real   hardware.]     11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED      In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications   venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.    As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),   headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist   Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China   Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional   communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite   system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the   satellite's communications channels.       [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the   release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid   January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of   Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg   scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional   satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has   been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530   M) through 2006.       I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this   venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.    While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the   current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two   separate sastellite ventures.      The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat-  2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing   Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and   other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational   model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing   venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to   Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later   satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between   Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture   through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to   proceed.      In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with   substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This   is just another indicator to add to the list.]     12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES     South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently   announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and   another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for   advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been   specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with   manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by   1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's   aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by   2000.                                      [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its   national aerospace industry, specifically including space   activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are   coming into the commercial space market.      As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications   satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995   on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide   television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,   southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.      South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on   Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US   $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of   this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""    Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-  monitoring micro-satellite.      This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth   observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)   project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean   government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with   optical and microwave sensors.     South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel   military effort to establish the capabilities for building and   launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a   government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,   funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an    expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the   Korean peninsula.            In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean   is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing   aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is   offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as   part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of   consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports   satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has   announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).       This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.    Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector   for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a   South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition   of commercial space market there over the next decade.]     13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH     As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the   results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and   investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of   March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the   market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%   of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a   general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The   increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which   is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this   trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite   well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms   which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its   results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

As I said at the start   of this, column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but   I'll have to put them into the next issue.       Looking ahead, I've got several articles in the works on new   happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market,   more news on international launchers appearing (and disappearing) on   the market, new international commercial space ventures,  and other   interesting developments.

1,"    Yesterday, the FBI was saying that at least three of the bodies had  gunshot wounds, indicating that they were shot trying to escape the  fire.  Today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there  is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies.    At the beginning of this siege, it was reported that while Koresh  had a class III (machine gun) license, today's paper quotes the  government as saying, no, they didn't have a license.    Today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with  shoulder weapons next to them, as if they had been using them while  dying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action I would expect  from a suicide.    Our government lies, as it tries to cover over its incompetence  and negligence.  Why should I believe the FBI's claims about  anything else, when we can see that they are LYING?

There is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung   disease has become calcified(chest x-rays would show this).  There are side  -effects to the use of EDTA because it is not specific for calcium(it also   binds other minerals).  I think that there have been some deaths when   EDTA chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that   were not detected and corrected.  In animal studies, the best way to remove   calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin C   and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin C, the extra   vitamin C was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium   from the plaques).    The calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably   can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form.  Most patietns   with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.    	1. ""Magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease: A review""  	   Am J Clin Nutr 27(1):59-79(1974).  Supplementation with   	   magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels.     	2. ""The importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular   	    disease"" Am. Heart J 94:649-57(1977).  The need to measure the   	    serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be   	    overemphasized.  This is a review article.    	3. ""Effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis   	   in cholesterol-fed rabbits"" Atherosclerosis 10:732-7(1990).    	   Magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of   	   plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1% by weight cholesterrol   	   added to their normal food.    Since EDTA will also bind magnesium, I've never really liked it's use for   the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.    Marty B. "

Personally, if the fire was set (by either side), I wonder about the  timing.  If Koresh & Co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of  wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything ""new""  that happened just around that point?  Similarly, if the FBI were going  to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't  it be more ""reasonable"" to believe the BD's would set the fire early  after the assault began?      The most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting  of the fire by the tanks.  Among other things, I say that because I  was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter  (watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least  one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.

0,"          April 16, 1993    INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL    The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on  cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of  millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a  comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as  export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to  robust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.    However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already  reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any  public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the  Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone  equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the  National Security Agency.  The so-called ""Clipper Chip"" is an 80-bit,  split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips  manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would  store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon  presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be  classified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for  incorporation into its communications products.         This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .    First, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an  inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure  product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.  Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for  the Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers  should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.    Second, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the  Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF  believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The  public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is  open to independent, expert scrutiny.      Third, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may  prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement  needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is  adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?   Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual's Fifth  Amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few  of the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to  answer.    In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance  of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy  and security.  However, the ""Clipper Chip"" solution ought to be  considered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the  discussion even begins.    DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:    ESCROW    The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom  hold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device  would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow  agents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.    Upon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would  have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to  the Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be  asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration  have suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the  Federal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,  but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.    CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS    The Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which  the government or others could break the code without securing keys from  the escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no  back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,  Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto  cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the  algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be  made public.    The Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,  secret contract between the National Security Agency and two private  firms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for  about four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.    GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER    In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes  in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers  for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al  Gore, and maybe even the President.  At today's Commerce Department press  briefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any  private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had  no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?    COMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY    The Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an  inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,  and law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export  controls on encryption technology and the FBI's Digital Telephony  Proposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the  National Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential  Directive describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement  in the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.    FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:    Jerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)  Daniel J.

1,"    From Israeline 4/27/93    Peace Talks Resume Today; Israel to Offer Palestinians New  Proposals     Israel Radio, KOL YISRAEL, reports on today's resumption in  Washington of the bilateral peace talks, following a recess which  lasted over four months. According to the report, Israel is  expected to offer the Palestinians new proposals regarding the  authority of the Palestinian Executive Council, general elections,  control over land and human rights issues in the Territories.  Israel will express its readiness to give the Palestinians control  of more land than previously offered. According to the radio  report, one estimate is that Israel will give the Palestinians  control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, as  well as broad authority on water issues. Israel will seek to  promote its offer to hold elections in the Territories in hopes of  strengthening the position of the Palestinian delegation to the  peace negotiations. According to Israel Radio, the Israeli  delegation to the bilateral talks with the Palestinians will offer  greater responsibilities to the Palestinian Executive Council  allowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it a  symbol for Palestinian sovereignty. U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering  tonight. It will be the first such event since the Madrid  conference. Head of the American team at the bilateral peace talks,  Edward Djerejian, said that tonight's gathering is meant to  demonstrate the U.S.' active role in the peace process.     ---  Naftaly Stramer 			 | Intergraph Electronics  Internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A      Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301  ""Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can.""

The Bill of Rights, as far as I can see, does not once refer to ""citizens"",  but it makes several references to ""people"". For example, Article IV:  ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,  and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be  violated""; Article V: ""no person shall be held to answer for a capital,  or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by  a Grand Jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,  or property, without due process of law""; Article VIII: ""excessive bail  shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual  punishments inflicted"".    Now I've never heard that Constitutional rights apply only to citizens;  aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the U.S.?  Whether slaves were considered ""not human"" I don't know, but it seems  that a case could be made that they weren't treated as ""people"" as defined  in the Bill of Rights. And since the nation is nominally based on the  Declaration of Independence which states that ""all Men are created equal,  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"",  it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition  of humanity.    -----  Eric Smith  erics@netcom.com  erics@infoserv.com  CI$: 70262,3610   "

0,"  If ""I forgot"" doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like, consider  this alternative.  Somewhere on the hard disk, duplicated a few times,  keep a 128-bit random number.  When the 128-bit digest of your  passphrase is computed, it is XORred with the random number before being  used as the key for your hard disk.  Writing random junk over the random  numbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone.    Now, if you were merely to *claim* that you have written random junk  over the XOR key, no-one would be able to tell whether or not you were  telling the truth.  This is (a) perjury, and (b) vunerable to  rubber-hose cryptography, but otherwise effective.    __                                  _____  \/ o\ Paul Crowley   pdc@dcs.ed.ac.uk \\ //  /\__/ Trust me.

(Acting Commander of Erzurum and Deveboynu regions and Commander          of the Second Erzurum Artillery Regiment Prisoner of War,          Lieutenant Colonel Toverdodleyov)    ""The things I have heard and seen during the two months, until the   liberation of Erzurum by the Turks, have surpassed all the   allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of   the Armenians. During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian   was permitted to approach the city and its environs.     While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained   in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the   area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to    attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the   plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder   of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by   the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers   who had remained in the rear during the war.     One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of   soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of   seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,   and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud   and dirt...     It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and   traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds   and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night   patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The    Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear   also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the   trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for   fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder   and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.     Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir   Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander   in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.   The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals   that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its   highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half   of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.     ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,   Odishelidge. They were as follows:     The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the   act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...   More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been   killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless    Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the   murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood    near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:   'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten   more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when   the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.     The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently   fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.   Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw   towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew   to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and   destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.     During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages   that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the    Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers   were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time   when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill   the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries   of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the    Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would   have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from   acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with   hatred and loathing.     Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that   he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The   Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the   stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since   the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed   in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen   of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping   him with the iron heel of his boot.     Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape   from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off   by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered   children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village   of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:     There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.   Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and   spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about   25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140    centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,   children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of   rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.     A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators   for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov   to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be    proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's   disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,   instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely   reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told   the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more   licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent   and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity   and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,   the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and   claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.     An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command   narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:     The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut   out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.   The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men    of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they   took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people   among this group were able to save their lives as the result of   my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were    released when they learnt that I understood what was going on.    Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the   Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered   on the streets.     On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent   Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were   threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for   murdering an innocent Turk.      When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would    be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare   you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the    Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard   that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within   the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same    day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to   him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible   act. However no result was achieved.     In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a   natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived   the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the    Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had   been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.    The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed   one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached   three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details   of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers   were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even   withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred   people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading   Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.   However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with   the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower   classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders   of the leading Armenian figures and commanders.      I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals   were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who   opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that   it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.   Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian   cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have   supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred   to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by   the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.   You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a   conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear   of the Turkish soldiers.     The incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real   nature of the Armenian ideology. Nothing which is already done can   be undone.""    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

The use of the term ZOG (which, I understand, stands for Zionist  Occupation Government, or some such bullshit) was used for satiric  purpose.  Since the posting I was responding to was on alt.conspiracy,  among other crossposted groups, I composed a satiric message  using jargon sometimes found on that group.  I figured that the  content (and context) of the message was so absurd that no one would  take any part of it completely seriously.    If anyone believes that I am an anti-semite, it will be news to my  Jewish boss and his Israeli wife, both of whom I am on cordial terms  with as well as as the many Jews that I have been friends, companions,  and co-workers with over the years.  Not to mention, news to me.    As far as guns go... I support the Bill of Rights -- all of it -- and  if you wish to arm yourself to the teeth, by all means, do so.  However, the concept of a .50 calibre machine gun as a sporting weapon  (for target practice or otherwise) struck, and continues to strike me  as moderately absurd, even if constitutionally protected.

2,"  A young French skeptic, who reads (skeptically) the UFO review OVNI  Presence (O.P.), sent me the following excerpt from an August 92  issue of this review (R.G. = Robert Galley, French minister of  defense in 1974, answering about the Belgian UFO wave):    ""O.P. : Can you conceive that the U.S. could allow themselves to send   their most modern crafts over foreign territory, with the Belgian   hierarchy ignoring that ?""  ""R.G. : Absolutely ! The best proof which I can give is that, some time   ago, without informing the French authorities, the U.S. based in   Germany sent a plane to make photos of Pierrelatte (*). We followed   this plane, and, after its landing on the Ramstein airport, Colonel X   got back the shots of Pierrelatte. The U.S. had not informed us...""  (*) There is an important military plant of enrichment of uranium at  Pierrelatte (Drome).    What kind of plane could it be ? Surely not an SR-71, which our planes  could not follow (and still can't)...    J. Pharabod "
2,"  Hi,  	I am looking for a very high speed   D/A converter (at least 8bits and 150MHz) for  a research application. A paper in  the January  issue of IEEE Solid-State Circuits mentions a   GaAs, 1GHz, 8bit DAC - anyone know where I can find  such a thing? Even a somewhat slower Si DAC would  do.  	Needless to say, I have looked in all the  conventional places (Vitesse, Motorola, National,  etc. etc.). Any pointers would be appreciated.    --- Seema Varma "
2,"  Hi Folks,                  Last year America bought two  ""Hall Generators"" which are  used as thrusters for space vehicles from former USSR,if I could recall  correctly these devices were sent to JPL,Pasadena labs for testing and  evaluation.                       I am just curious to know  how these devices work and what  what principle is involved .what became of them.There was also some  controversy that the Russian actually cheated,sold inferior devices and  not the one they use in there space vehicles.

While I am unfamiliar with the scientific context here, it appears obvious  that his speculation (for lack of a better or more neutral word) was  at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance  of current theory coupled with his observations.  It would appear that  something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation  into that theory (or to tailor the theory to cover the observation).

Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also,  ""extra-scientific"", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of  rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble  over what a ""surprising"" experiment is, what counts as ""surprising"", etc.  The same may be said about ""logical grounds"".  My point is that quite frequently  (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to  previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of  some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples  such as Toricelli's Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his ""sea of air""  hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) ""surprising""?  Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must  be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)  out of ""perfectly rational grounds""?  Well, there was a pretty successful and  well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.  The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty  at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it ""new""?  Well, one  could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new  domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you  like.  --   Gary H.

In response to Email requests, I have assembled this list of  large-integer arithmetic packages of which I have heard.  Most of these are C function libraries, available in source form.    For your convenience, I have placed copies of  some of these on ripem.msu.edu (35.8.1.178).  They are  available for anonymous FTP in the directory ""pub/bignum"".  However, what I have may not be the most current version in all cases.    Here they are, in no particular order:    mp      Multiple Precision package that comes with some Unixes            Multiple precision package accessed via -lmp flag on your      compiler.  Provides +, -, *, /, gcd, exponentiation,      sqrt.  Comes with SunOS, NeXT Mach, BBN Mach 1000,       and probably a few others.  See ""man mp"".        Object code only, of course.    PARI      Henri Cohen, et al., Universite Bordeaux I, Paris, FRANCE            Multiple precision desk calculator and library routines.      Contains optimized assembly code for Motorola 68020,       semi-optimized code for SPARC, and apparently rather slow      generic C version.  Does both integers and reals.      Does vectors and matrices as well as scalars.      Contains a number of advanced functions, some of which I've      never heard of.  (""Weber's function""?)      Has a factorization function, primality test, & other related stuff.      Plenty of TEX documentation.      Public domain, but you can't distribute modified versions.      Available via anonymous FTP from math.ucla.edu.  There seem to      be Mac- and NeXT-specific versions there in addition to:      Filename:  pari-1.35a.tar.Z        Arithmetic in Global Fields  (Arith)      Kevin R. Coombes, David R. Grant            Package of routines for arbitrary precision integers or      polynomials over finite fields.  Includes basic +, -, *, /      and a few others like gcd.  Source code in C.      Distributed under the terms of the GNU public license.      Includes man pages and TEX documentation.      Filename:  arith.tar.Z    Arbitrary Precision Math Library      Lloyd Zusman   Los Gatos, CA            C package which supports basic +, -, *, /.  Provides for radix      points (i.e., non-integers).  Not as polished as the others here.      Posted to comp.sources.misc in October 1988.      Filename:  apml.tar.Z        BigNum      J. Vuillemin, INRIA, FRANCE, and others.      Distributed by Digital Equipment Paris Research Lab (DECPRL)            A ""portable and efficient arbitrary-precision integer"" package.      C code, with generic C ""kernel"", plus assembly ""kernels"" for      MC680x0, Intel i960, MIPS, NS32032, Pyramid, and of course VAX.      This is probably one of the better-known packages of this type.      Implements +, -, *, /, mod, plus logical operations OR, AND, XOR.      Both signed and unsigned arithmetic available.      Available via email from librarian@decprl.dec.com.      You will receive 5 shell archives.  Give your postal address      and you will also receive printed documentation from France.      Package includes TEX documentation.      Publicly available for non-commercial use.      I removed this from my archive when I heard a rumor that PRL      doesn't like others to distribute it.  However, BIGNUM *is*      distributed as part of ecpp (see below).    Lenstra's package      Arjen Lenstra   Bellcore            Portable unsigned integer package written entirely in C.      Includes +, -, *, /, exponentiation, mod, primality testing,      sqrt, random number generator, and a few others.  The package      was uncommented and undocumented; I have tried to add enough      comments to get by.  This is the only of these packages that I      have actually used.  It works well and is very portable.        I haven't done any benchmarks against the others, but the code       looks clever & Lenstra is an accomplished number theorist.      Unlike the other packages here, this one requires you to allocate      storage statically--only a problem if your numbers are really huge.      Arjen has placed the code in the public domain.        Filename:  lenstra.tar.Z    lenstra_3.1      Arjen Lenstra,  Bellcore        An improved version of Arjen's package above.  This one      does signed arithmetic and dynamic allocation (which can be turned      off as an option). Has a few new routines, too.  ""lenstra_3.1"" contains      minor bugfixes to the previously-available ""lenstra_2"" and ""lenstra_3"".      Filename:  lenstra_3.1.c    bmp  (Brent's Multiple Precision?)      R. P. Brent        1981 vintage FORTRAN code to do extended precision floating &      fixed point arithmetic.  Includes most of the mathematical      functions you'd find in a FORTRAN run-time library.      This code is an ACM algorithm, number 524.      To obtain, send a mail message to  netlib@ornl.gov      containing the line ""send mp.f from bmp"" or better yet, perhaps      just start with ""help"".    SPX      Kannan Alagappan & Joseph Tardo, DEC            This is a huge prototype public key authentication system      based on RSA.  I mention it here because those who have heard      of SPX have probably correctly guessed that it contains a large      integer package and I want to inform you that the large integer      package it contains is indeed DEC's BigNum from France.      You can get a beta test copy of SPX from crl.dec.com (192.58.206.2).       Use it only for testing, as it ""may"" expire on a certain date.      (I don't know whether this has expired yet.)    amp  (Antti's Multiple Precision?)      Antti Louko   alo@kampi.hut.fi        Multiple precision integer package in C.  Includes +, -, *, /, %,      pow, mod, 1/x mod y, random, sqrt, gcd.  Available for non-commercial      use.  The package includes ""share-secret"", a public key system based      on the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.      This is normally part of the well-known ""des-dist.tar.Z"",      but I have removed the DES part to avoid having to deal with       cryptographic export laws, and have named the result:      Filename:  amp.tar.Z    gennum        Per Bothner   U of Wisconsin-Madison        C++ routines and classes to do generic arithmetic, both      integer and rational.

MIRACL      (By someone in Dublin, Ireland)        Integer and fractional multiple precision package.      Includes factorization, primality testing, encryption.      Not public domain, apparently.

The cult's leaders, who claim that God speaks to them, have told cult   members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which   they believe to me imminent.     Weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military   weapons as well as sporting arms.  A recent series in nearby newspapers   has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region.     Troops have surrounded the cult's ""city"" after incidents in which   officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  There have been   reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is   said to be strictly administered.

By the way, this is not a claim of ""Koresh's folks,"" it is a claim of   the government -- the same government which DID have grenades and grenade  launchers and DID use them.  No one has seen ANY evidence of the BD's   having, much less using, such weaponry.

See above, for one example.  The ""abuses"" involved were non-mainstream   religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  Sound  familiar?  In my opinion, the BD's were as much a real threat to society  as the Mormons were then or are now.  (That is, until they were provoked.)    By the way, I find your statement about ""non-Nazi"" law ironic.  Koresh was   suspected of violating the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was BASED ON the  text of the Nazi Weapons Law of March 18, 1938.  (""Gun Control's Nazi   Connection;"" Jews for Preservation of Firearms Ownership, 2872 S.   Wentworth Ave., Milwaukee, WI 53207, (414) 769-0760.)    By the way, what was Koresh's specific violation?  FAILURE TO PAY A TAX.  That's right -- the BATF are TREASURY agents.  Did a failure to pay a  $200/gun tax really justify armed attack, night torture, and ultimately  the death penalty?    > |> I'll bet all you cult haters are happy now, right?

He said they should have tried to break down the     BD's loyalty to Koresh through psychological means.   Koresh's whole    theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces     of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  The Feds    played into his hands **PERFECTLY**.   By surrounding the compound    with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them     they strongly reinforced Koresh's message that the outside world was    evil and threatening.    He said instead they should have set up     a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  If they    broadcast anything over PA systems it should have been loving     relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'    childhoods.   The idea is to make the outside world and surrender    seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   Interesting comments.      ---peter       "

Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the  muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or  plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the  intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also  seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].   Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the  gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to   be a proper reaction [and so does the law].     Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force  has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the  less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some  risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent   since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be  more deadly.    --   Michael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..

The noise you hear is due to the momentary  opening and closing of the path.    The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high  impedance audio circuits a resistive ""T"" is constructed close to characteristic  impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers  the audio.    In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are  shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic  impedance.    Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used  to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.    Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to ""Make before  break and Vica Versa"" but I haven't seen any of these for years.    Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.    A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive ""optical isolator"".. It consists  of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is  off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers  passing the audio.  Once again this device in a ""T"" switches the audio.  Varying  the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and  you have a mixer!

I'll  tell you about my first flight.    At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine  straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab  onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)  to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my  involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could  feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while  you have a cold).    At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,  since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment  going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of  gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay  attention to physiology at that time.    After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one  of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion  sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly  -- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,  concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to  parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I  had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically  useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in  the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just  this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.  (He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous  people who don't get sick on the thing.)    I didn't think of it as a ""constant sensation of falling"" so  much as like swimming in air.  It's very close to the sensations  I feel when I'm scuba diving and I turn my head down and fins up.    Jerry:  : >And what is the motion sickness  : >that some astronauts occasionally experience?     Ron:  : It is the body's reaction to a strange environment.

I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do,  among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.

2,"  1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope  and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtual  certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset  control's zero detent position.    2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Many  generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfest  flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm  terminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connector  on it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out  .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You may  also find that loading the output of the function generator also  reduces the harmonic distortion.    Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want to  use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the  voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:    ------10K--------+---------? ohm ----                   |  Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.  (loaded)         |  -----------------+-------------------    Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracy  to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.

This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into  the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There  was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of  state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.  The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was  mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that  many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with  low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for  travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a  university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well  as salary.    During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure  scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they   were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is  probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try  to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution  emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to  discussion about their problems, the job got done.    The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the  future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was  unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the  future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as   NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly  keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,  making it more difficult for them to act to support research.    The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which  the government supports research the university will not provide funding,  and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,  as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of  a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask  for one?  The answer I will get is, ""Get the money from NSF.""  Now the  money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it  comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from  getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects  get supported, and how much.      Also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread.  So instead  of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research  institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into  being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating  reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal  has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals  already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am  proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find   impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow  I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea  which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to  something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast,   and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it  is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring   more than minimal attention of a good researcher.      I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would  have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government  is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.  --   Herman Rubin, Dept. of Statistics, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette IN47907-1399  Phone: (317)494-6054  hrubin@snap.stat.purdue.edu (Internet, bitnet)    {purdue,pur-ee}!snap.stat!hrubin(UUCP) "

The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored  transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use  more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to  do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they  must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.    	The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group  	of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.    With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed  more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is  the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.    	Well, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by  	everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll  	just let it pass for now.    	Case Western reserve, huh?  Do the Feds know about that big   	stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in  your  	house?  Are you the same Daniel Oldham that lives on Orchard  	Drive?  Just so they get the address right, that is...    Look  at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country  of ours.    	Well, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.    	I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was  	in Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect  	the right of the government to attack its own citizens with  	military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant  	is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault  	on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in  	Iraq, or Syria...)    With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with  mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few  women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn  to death 51 days later.    	This is a joke, right?  Or are they really letting fools like  	you into CWRU now?  Too bad. Used to be a good school.  How'd you  	get in anyway, did your old man buy a new wing for the library? "

Address all letters to his address, given at the end  of this document.       -- Russell      FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA                       TECHNOLOGY      Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987           You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer  technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-  cles.  We tend to think of Orwell's 1984, or Terry Gilliam's  Brazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin's  slave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-  phisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on  his ""enemies list.""  Or, we recognize that for the price  of  a  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of  sound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by  a  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-  longings if it beeps.         But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there  were cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with  clubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for  eavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.  Though  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the  evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.         In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-  ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from  those who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors  the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-  not).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the  merit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-  tested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-  scribe government bureaucracy than ""dull"" and ""sluggish""?         One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology  over tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable  crossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably  and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if  that  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike  the longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could  get  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no  formal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required  elaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to  achieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow  could simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the  arrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-  get.)         Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights  likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government  soldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was  plain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves  not only against one another, but against their governmental  masters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-  piercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the  medieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and  Crossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-  tively, for its unlawful possession.         Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology  like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the  handgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced  machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal  and inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45  called ""the equalizer.""  A frail dance-hall hostess with one  in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself  against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-  ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the  repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  ""a  man  on  horseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be  captured.""  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon  flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a  true one.         Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher  (with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-  alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can  such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's  own possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-  change   information   over   an   insecure   communications  channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or  skywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously  met  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-  puter, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY  X-MP  can't  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should  be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-  cations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.  Technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it  will  have  totally demolished government's control over in-  formation transfer.         I'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-  ics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is  called the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman  who  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact  that, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very  large  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the  two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    ""Ex-  tremely""  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100  digits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-  eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful  computer now in existence.         The  ""public"" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-  uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-  tor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *  (q-1) + 1}.  The ""private"" part of the key consists  of  the  other factor  y.         Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned  into an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple  A=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer  is then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting  integer is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver  decrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y  (modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always  yield the original number started with.         What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why  it  is  called  ""public-key""  cryptography,""  is  that I can  openly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while  keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me  an encrypted message, namely                         x                       a    (mod pq)  ,  but only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking  what  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the  result (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher  keys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust  each other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-  change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and  disseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining  the secrecy of his own  y.         Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a ""dig-  ital signature,"" to enable one to authenticate the source of  a given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,  I raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod  your pq)  and send that.        However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and  raise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my  pq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and  send this, then even after you have normally ""decrypted"" the  message,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you  then raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result  (mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-  ginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I  could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret  y).         And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-  day tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of  personal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that  American schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-  puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in  fact, because there are things computers can do  which  will  interest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-  cisely these students who one generation hence will be going  head-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the  Soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to  teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning  ballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal  computer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying  machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of  text,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this  weren't threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the  copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but  unbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-  cessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few  copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-  sively than machine guns are in the United States.)         Now  the  ""conservative"" position is that we should not  sell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use  them  in weapons systems.  The ""liberal"" position is that we  should sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and  cooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don't make the sale, there  will certainly be some other nation willing to.         For my part, I'm ready to suggest that the  Libertarian  position should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and  if  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn't  work load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over  Moscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-  scription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this  is not a position that has gained much support among members  of  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-  ter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus's characters, we  are political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a  particular  goal may not look anything like what most people  would consider a ""straight line.""    Taking  a  long  enough  world-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-  ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to  the enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of  the Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen  missiles aimed at Moscow.         But  there's  the rub:  A ""long enough"" world view does  suggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the  simply  stupid  will ""get what they deserve,"" but what's not  immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being  killed, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.        When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-  tack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,  functioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to  hamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political  gradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have  patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire  and spit.  The state not only taxes us to  ""feed  the  poor""  while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive  up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-  sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-  crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness  the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as  potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years  ago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy  risked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase  was called the ""moral equivalent of war"" and the Feds  swung  into  action.    For the first time in American history, the  speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-  came an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of  oil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-  can oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who  sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our  grossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that  government  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has  lowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking  to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,  what  can we call this except the ""moral equivalent of civil  war--the government against its own people?""         And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-  ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to  court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too  cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be  compelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it  be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?         So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of  hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we  certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of  stability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there  exists  almost  a  ""black  hole""  effect in the evolution of  nation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-  dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state  warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to  the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes  all but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen  in the area of so-called ""welfare"" payments.  When those who  sup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those  whose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible  choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-  ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go  down to the nearest ""welfare"" office, find just  two  people  on  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form  a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question  of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor.         So essentially those who love liberty need an ""edge"" of  some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-  ously  can't  use  the  altruists'  ""other-directedness""  of  ""work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of  a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.""  Recognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it  is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture.  If you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a  ""cause,"" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as  to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue  working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy  to draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-  peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or  libertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight  and say something like, ""Listen, follow me as I enunciate my  noble ""cause,"" contribute your money to support the ""cause,""  give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the ""cause,"" strive  selflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your  children are dead) maybe your children's children will actu-  ally  live under egoism""--you'd all think I'd gone mad.  And  of course you'd be right.  Because the point I'm  trying  to  make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,  when, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it  profitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only  then.         While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-  tical  action, I don't believe that it is the only, nor even  necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing  freedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the  investment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-  ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all  forms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who's in-  terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them  unilaterally.         There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to  the Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-  ready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with  the saying, you might well feel that you've heard  it  often  enough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,  and moreover, that maybe you're even tired of hearing it.  I  shall therefore repeat it now:         If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him  for a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him  for a lifetime.         Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of  a  ""workfare""  vs.  ""welfare""  context;  namely, that if you  genuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him  how to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.  And of course this is true, if only because the next time he  is hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even  able to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how  to fish, he is completely self sufficient.         But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order  content of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to  glean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it  again.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist  slant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-  tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry  beggars as we may encounter.         But consider:         Suppose this Eskimo doesn't know how to  fish,  but  he  does  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,  have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country  because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and  they ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose  the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering  fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first  thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type  categorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise  that  every  trade  must  have a ""winner"" and a ""loser;"" the  idea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the  ""expense"" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this  scenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-  thing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-  ished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information  (rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum  game.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  ""law  of  diminishing   returns,""   the  ""first  and  second  laws  of  thermodynamics""--all those ""laws"" which constrain our possi-  bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that's  anarchy!         Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry  Eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his  nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish  contain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he  tells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and  even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's  health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing  adults.   Perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought  to be government property, and therefore it is the  function  of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-  ment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-  ously extends to competent adults the ""benefits"" it provides  to children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,  all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need  not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior  thought physically risky or morally ""naughty.""  But, in  any  case,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-  lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of  his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of ""pos-  session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.""         Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely  oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an  affront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-  ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-  ary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting  this tyrant's goal.  (Your rationale may be ""altruistic""  in  the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or  ""egoistic"" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the  oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-  haps even other motives.)         But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to  your ""cause,"" you're not about to mount a military campaign,  or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.  However, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-  formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a  hundredfold.    I say ""literally,"" because for a fraction of  the effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to  smuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a  hundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-  geted government, like present-day America, at least permits  open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-  stricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government  attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then  you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write  your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to  your mythical Eskimo's public-key parameters.  But as far as  increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine  nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others  re-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you  have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-  eological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-  cided.  Recall Harry Browne's dictum  from  ""Freedom  in  an  Unfree World"" that the success of any endeavor is in general  inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-  sion is necessary to its fulfilment.         If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has  been dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,  Lincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .  Khadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped  by  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and  Wozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-  vasive, and not nearly so bloody.         And  that's  where  I'm  trying  to  take The LiberTech  Project.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-  slave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-  work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize  freedom for ourselves.         But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at  present)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government  wants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-  ture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-  ple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor  when government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to  commit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that  fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.  This law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but  it does indicate how government thinks.         Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed  pose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone  who  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the ""underground  railroad"" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as  the sovereign government of the United States of America  at  that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite  as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-  larly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to  ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,  alcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-  ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents  for his ""crime""--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life  when  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this  drug.         So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-  conspirator  and pardoned felon . . . ""Let me make one thing  perfectly clear:""  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,  participate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no  matter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid  such  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-  tional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological  processes,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane  or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-  censing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is  needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-  self.         So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and  despair,  thinking,  ""Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of  this State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian  before  I'll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my  goddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery""--recognize  that  such  is not the case.

Any  friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested  are welcome as well.  I'm not even asking for stamped  self-  addressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-  bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared  with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you  should have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to  plug,  I'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.

Anyway, every application of these principles  should make the world just a little freer, and I'm certainly  willing to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-  ture.

1,"    From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>  Subject: Hebrew labor: racist connotations      AVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR  ---------------------------------    ""Hebrew labor"" is a concept which has served the Zionist movement  for a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew  must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The  land in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same  new Jew who has ""learned"" to work it. Both aspects of the  two-pronged concept of ""Hebrew labor"" have racist connotations. On  the one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical  labor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other  hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the  Arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.    The occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from  the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and  hot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of ""Hebrew labor"" to the  history books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It  has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to  problems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this  concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the  closing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of  Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, ""I have no tears for those who  get rich off of cheap labor"". 2) to furnish an answer to the  unemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for  wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.    The Israeli government is considering plans to import labor from  the far- East to replace native people, Palestinians, who work in  their own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two  ethnical communities and ruling over them.

Or is it your   interpretation of statements in such literature? Or is this a figment   of your imagination or a Nazi Armenian propaganda movie script? In   any case, a fascinating piece of analysis. Here are the facts:      Source: Walker, Christopher: ""Armenia: The Survival of a Nation.""          New York (St. Martin's Press), 1980.    This generally pro-Armenian work contains the following information  of direct relevance to the Nazi Holocaust:     a) Dro (the butcher), the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the   architect of the genocide of 2.5 million Muslims, the most respected   of Nazi Armenian leaders, established an Armenian Provisional Republic   in Berlin during World War II;     b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social   theories of the Nazis, declared themselves and all Armenians to be members   of the Aryan 'Super-Race;'     c) they published an Anti-Semitic, racist journal, thereby aligning themselves   with the Nazis and their efforts to exterminate the Jews; and,     d) they mobilized an Armenian Army of up to 30,000 members which fought side   by side with the Wehrmacht.       In fact, by 1942, Nazi Armenians in Europe had established a vast   network of pro-German collaborators, that extended over two continents.   Thousands of Armenians were serving the German army and Waffen-SS in   Russia and Western Europe. Armenians were involved in espionage and   fifth-column activities for Hitler in the Balkans and Arabian Peninsula.   They were promised an 'independent' state under German 'protection' in   an agreement signed by the 'Armenian National Council.' (A copy of   this agreement can be found in the 'Congressional Record,' November 1,   1945; see Document 1.) On this side of the Atlantic, Nazi Armenians   were aware of their brethrens alliance. They had often expressed   pro-Nazi sentiments until America entered the war.      In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi  concentration camps, the Nazi Armenians in Germany formed the first  Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion   had grown into eight battalions of 30,000-strong under the command of Dro   (the butcher), who was the former dictator of x-Soviet Armenia and the   architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds   between 1914-1920. An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious   Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged   by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed   and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the   members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of   extermination of the Jews.    This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""  performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and  exterminated 2.5 million Muslims by colluding with the invading Russian army.      Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'                                                    (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)                             'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists                               a single Turkish soul.' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)     "

Having watched most of the televised trial, I can answer that  when such statements were made by the defense atty, the prosecutor did  object, and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously  falling under the ""self-incrimination"" type of objection.  There was  quite a bit of meta-discussion during the trial over the use of graphic  language, with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the  exact language.  Practically every time the defense tried to get the  plaintiffs to ""self-incriminate"" by asking them such questions, there  were objections and sustains.    	At one point the defense managed to get in a quip about  ""solicitation for a felony"" and the judge herself said ""sustained""  before the prosecutor could get the objection stated.  --   G.

(AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired for  allegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youth  worked, said ""You're going to die"" and fatally shot him and two others, police  said.    A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.    The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at about  midnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactory  condition Wednesday.    Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested at  gunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises in  Foster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.

I consider 5' a reasonable space  limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to  those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at  what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the  endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility  of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and  draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental  flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing  the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.  Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault  rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has  only range and acurracy going for it.    >They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to  >protect their homes and families. Using nuclear weapons close   >to home will not accomplish this.    	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much  more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word  would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this  is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change  quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians  intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The  balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.    >There is, however, another problem: In any case of civil war,  >the strength of the militias fighting on each side should  >reflect the popular will.

That seems to be the case already, given that heavy  weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low  numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior  weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically  superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training  includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,  whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.    >I think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small   >minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power  >through violence.

I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers  of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the  heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman  tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders  from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,  though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should  therefore be jointly maintained and operated.    >Here, I think we have to be carefull about _which_ ""state"" we  >are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to  >overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely  >destructive to that end for that same government to control   >the militia's arms.

The State having control  over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state  to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that  the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,  I would have to assume that State control would rest on the  authority of the Governor and militia officers.    >That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select  >militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained  >specialists.

Similarly, the  >select militia should be incapable of action without the  >aid of the general militia.    	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,  fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few  people with government support.  Just as you argued above that  the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control  so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this  situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding  all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.  I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that  the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the  unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.    >Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard's  >infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local  >governments.

We have to assume that there would be those who would  side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all  the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.  I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the  local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their  armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the  tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.  I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.    >>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds  >>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and  >>the like.  >  >I would much rather see these things handled by the local,   >general militias.    	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to  outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to  call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster  than anything else.    >Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of  >the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to   >be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry  >arm of the regular army.    	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think  main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up  field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton  trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff  of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units  in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.    	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy  equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light  stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the  states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local  ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,  hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,  the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for  other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a  very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias  for these functions.    < Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >  <  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a  court order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal  wiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the  system of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?    The second section shows the sequence of events.  The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the  line with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope  with digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are  talking analogue telephony here).  What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?  Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?  I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some  intermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course  in data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the  digital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the  same problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not  be at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later  it would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units  (these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.    How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed  for use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone  line quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised  speech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to  add lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.    >Q:   Will the devices be exportable?

This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect  anything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body  called BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,  that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know  if this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.  Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get  to fish in the escrowed key pool as well.      		Peter Ilieve		peter@memex.co.uk   "

Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completely  misunderstood what you said.  Also, my math is frequently noted for  being wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.    I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start and  one stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytes  per second is 1.44K.    Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech in  stereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to a  Nyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially if  you think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/A  converter will probably not present you with a signal that has been  cut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higher  frequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcome  that problem.)    On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,  you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter and  then linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,  but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good in  that respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, and  compression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization of  less than 5% were common.  Although I must say that these were musical  sounds, not speech.    Have fun.    --   Stephan <neuhaus@informatik.uni-kl.de>  sig closed for inventory.  Please leave your pickaxe outside.

Thanks for posting the references. I do not normally read t.p.m.,  and I posted my request for references because Jim's article  was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewish  disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are  one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and  rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms  than blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create  cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any  claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by  decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.  If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has  not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be  given the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been  documented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and  shameful. Especially so because the official who failed to  provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians  was probably Jewish, and as a Jew I know that he should have  known better.

Shearer    I do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. However,  using the info they gather while listening, they can go searching THE right  place and find good, strong evidence, which they can use in court.     Question : currently, it is easy to wire-tap, from the technical point of  view, at least. Anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen  to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station. The police  also, obviously. The clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the  non-authorized person to eavesdrop (note that I DO NOT write << impossible>> ).  The privacy will thus improve from the current situation. Poeple who REALLY  have something to hide already DO NOT use the phone to speak of these things.  If an illegal operation is really worth, one can afford having critical data  carried by a person rather than sending it electronically.   The clipper chip will not change this.     The problem is more politic. Foreign countries will never accept the clipper  chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own  police following their OWN law, not the US law. i.e. each country will have  its own escrow. How then will it be possible to monitor the international  traffic? or, will encrypted international traffic be possible ? or will there  be an international escrow, some kind of U.N. thing ?    Forbidding crypted communication is impractical: how is it possible to spot  a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate  on the various existing networks. What about private networks ? And this will  be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase  in the next years.    I think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the  risk of , for instance, one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's  communications. It will bring no more as regards to security. Is it worth ?  I think so if its cost is limited, I think that many privacy invasions are done  not only by official services, but also by private entities. The clipper can  help reducing these. Provided we do not hope too much of it, it is not a real  danger and it can be helpful.    Ph. HOOGVORST "

Firstly, an aside:    I agree that the weakness exists, but I have a lot of trouble  believing that it represents a difficulty in real life. Given:    1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,  and the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clients  really do want that level of security    2. These same people want to keep P a secret    I find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P  lying around.    (I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small  part of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in  C her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find  this at least as surprising.)    Back to the question:    If I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I  would also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up  the next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original  question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the  message with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,  and I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the following  for discussion.    Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to  share, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by  knowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they  CORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to  be created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not  know which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,  she would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.    What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.  (Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't  have exactly the same effect).    Now, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC  computed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):    1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S    2. break C2 into n-bit chunks    3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)    4. for i in each chunk sequentially         set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]    At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.    (Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the  plaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in  the same manner.)    NLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplest  non-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed  (even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table  called Sbox, and use:    x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].    Practically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve never  sees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid  substitution on it.    Also practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32  bits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might  work on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detail  for the discussion at hand.

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term  denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The  rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to  distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made  ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines  with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A ""D""  engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.  An ""F"" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a  doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size ""O"" are  available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are  shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of  size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as  controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket  engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)    There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which  holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities  (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of  Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved  in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and  companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.    Bottom Line: It's legit. I suggest you send for a catalog - but forget  the dynamite, will ya?    -Larry C. "

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain  is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in  both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other  therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol  work better in migraine than tension-type headache.    The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got  relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than  migraine does not necessarily mean ""psychogenic""; I suspect that  organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in  migraine.  ---   .

You can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you  had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave  cooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it's  hard to digest anyway.     For comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal ""last"" longer eat pasta or  rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe  smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the  baby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How  tight are your clothes. You shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses   your middle. Be sure not to ""suck in"" your stomach when sitting, again it  will put pressure on the digestive tract.     Try laying on your sides, back,  and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.  Easier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby  ""turn"" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.  When you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the  diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my  second one to do over again I think I'd have tried to loosen up since he  didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.      Maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe  she just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she's young.   But this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something  to be avoided if possible.     Nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. My  first pregnancy was miserable. During the second I had very little trouble.  Some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better  chance of carrying their baby.

Your argument tries to paint the BATF critics as right-wing  gun nuts, and just mixes up two issues.    I am one of the BATF/FBI critics, and yet I am a liberal  and just as anti-gun as you are.  I just happen to believe  that everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies.  They're all human beings, not some nest of wasps that  you're trying to exterminate.    The BATF created the crisis situation by the way they handled  the original raid.  It was well known that Koresh regularly  went jogging outside his property.  He could have been served  with a search warrant then.  He could have been arrested if  he had refused to comply.  Instead officers armed with grenades  invaded the property.  This escalated into a shooting war  with tragic deaths on both sides.    Those were the first two mistakes:  the bad judgment of  asking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probably  illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served.    At this point, the situation escalated to where it was  described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis.  That's when the government started covering their traces,  sealing the warrant, revising their reported history of  the incident, etc.    Things were already building up to disaster.  Now the  government could have simply closed the supply routes  and waited.  But according to Janet Reno, that option  had ""never been seriously considered"".  So, supposedly  because the agents were ""frustrated and fatigued"", and  because there supposedly were no backups, they felt  they had to go in.    Now it's entirely possible that Koresh was responsible  for the fire.  If that's so, he deserves the blame  for the deaths of the people in his compound.    But the government's hands are far from clean.  Their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus  contempt for the 4th amendment.  The motivations  for the second raid are just too unbelievable.  And their coverup of the events of the first  raid undermines their credibility in anything  they do thereafter.  We have only some very  biased FBI agents' word for what happened.    And please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun  discussion.  Anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners  deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government  agents.  And Koresh's civil rights exist whether his  guns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal,  or whatever!       --   Rob Strom, strom@watson.ibm.com, (914) 784-7641  IBM Research, 30 Saw Mill River Road, P.O.

Without knowing more it is not  possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,  or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are  no dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relate  to obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on   recurrence of Crohn's.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from  recurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as   recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the  intestine.

1,"    ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for  NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Dear sir:    By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication  of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are  drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of   momentus ""scientific"" findings. These are regularly released to the press  without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and  often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.  Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however  meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle  serious studies by criminologists.    The latest effort -- ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:  A Tale of Two Cities,"" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying   editorial, ""Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,"" by two employees  of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult  to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few  data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length  to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular  order.    	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to   	support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting  	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate  	of homicide."" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that  	contention.  	  	2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very  	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,  	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities  	are very different with very different demographic characteristics  	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in  	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white  	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be  	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-  	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various  	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.  	  	3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,  	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all  	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect  	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-  	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth  	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM  	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving  	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that  	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding  	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that  	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day  	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without  	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?  	  	4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national  	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily  	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because  	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific  	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which  	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""?  	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite  	""scientific"" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide  	rate *exceeds* that of such ""wild west"" cities in Texas as  	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado  	Springs. (Ref. 3)  	  	5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or  	handguns ""are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in  	Vancouver."" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending  	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is  	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry  	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in  	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of  	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun  	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number  	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns  	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns  	legally for protection, registration figures are  	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York  	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,  	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population  	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver  	has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than New York City.  	  	The second method of measuring gun density is ""Cook's gun  	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity  	differences."" But the validation was by Cook of his own  	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a  	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is  	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement  	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking  	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide  	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in  	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in  	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-  	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and  	Vancouver.  	  	6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and  	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that  	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to  	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian  	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal  	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more  	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually  	the case.  	  	7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain  	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the  	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of   	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a  	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number  	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making  	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest  	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences  	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,  	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social  	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,  	the authors of the NEJM ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention  	most factors related to crime control.  	  	8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective  	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not  	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost  	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from  	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the  	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be  	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury  	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors  	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides  	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle  	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides  	involving firearms.  	  	9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the ""study,""  	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it ""applied  	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb  	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly  	handguns."" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly  	be mistaken for ""scientific methods"" by a sociologists or  	criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle ""study"" is the equivolent  	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding  	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25  	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,  	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while  	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure  	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure,   	announcing in a ""special article"" a new medical breakthrough.  	It would be nice to think that such a ""study"" would neither be  	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.  	  	Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC  	make them willing to present shoddy research as ""scientific  	breakthroughs"" in ""special articles"" and editorials relating  	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying  	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight  	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about  	the distortions contained in ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,  	and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Firearm Injuries: A Call  	for Science."" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside  	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize  	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.  	  				REFERENCES    1.

Wright            (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)          Someone once wrote: ""Statistics are like a bikini.  What they real is     suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.""  The problem is demonstrated     by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting     to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by     the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal     of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and     suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a      community.""        The nine medical doctors who published ""Handgun Regulations, Crime,     Assaults, and Homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite     many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver     has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations     make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems     indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period     1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.     Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,     Why?        The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case     to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,     that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their     evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and      unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point     does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support     of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody     knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We     are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that     a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates     when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.        Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two     indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-     weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons     permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the     permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.  *     The second bit of evidence is ""Cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands  *  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index  *  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in   *  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage  *  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.  *     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,  *  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take  *  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be  *  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides  *  is directly related to their relative availability in the general   *  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To  *  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of  *  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.        Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that     guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.     The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun     ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates     reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,     that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.        In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of     violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the      consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin      Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime     for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke     an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.        Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data     on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are ""similar in     many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law     stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish     the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all     else is equal"" among things being compared.  *     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look   *  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime  *  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage  *  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle  *  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.  *  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the  *  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-  *  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown  *  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.  *     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is  *  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates  *  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide  *  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.  *  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due  *  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,  *  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics  *  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison  *  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial  *  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle  *  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain  *  in either city.        Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the     cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority      groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability""     (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not     matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why     blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed     in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,     do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)        Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between     Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have      anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol      abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city     of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the      Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the     United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian     percentage?        The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many     ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent     more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part     or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such     as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.  *     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide  *  result in a ""complex picture.""  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing  *  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They  *  also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important  *  confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks     *  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of  *  Vancouver's population.""  Given the evidence presented in the article,  *  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle  *  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial  *  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,  *  since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race  *  is not available for Vancouver.""        The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in      gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple     example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms     of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one      would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.     Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce      crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into     account?  In this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: Guns are     more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city     problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the     appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very     seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities     for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,     and their results are impossible to interpret.        In the editorial ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science"" accompanying     the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the     authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public     heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from     nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate     plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them     out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are     little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this     study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical     identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--     is cause for further concern.

On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute  between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept  Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far  more than that.       The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a  giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,  fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South  Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the  hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on  all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the  Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.       Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of  the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a  counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.       To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of  time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is  coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are  overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot  simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time  without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British  will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no  matter how risky they may be.       There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no  choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That  reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered  losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will  be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by  the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts  will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle  losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice  but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking  even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,  my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.       The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,  ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing  countless commentators referring to the British task force as an  ""armada"" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very  uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400  years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,  but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it  changed the course of history--and it was none other than the  English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.       The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the  reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion  fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England.   They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake  and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada  by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped  with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of  reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered  the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely  half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's  defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened  the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its  expansion into a truly global empire.       Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full  circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the  world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now  the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in  confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for  invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four  hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;  today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.       The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake  Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of  the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's  naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may  well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal  Navy.       My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:    Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND  Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE  Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.    Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month  it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and  a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great  Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the  Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been  countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it  calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing  in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about  them.       The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba  is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize.   After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer  than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the  remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,  and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are  watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.       The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all  about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's  doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's  got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,  submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have  even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight.   Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated  and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and  submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and  sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has  grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada  numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has  already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.       Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this  fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the  major media is ""oil.""  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist  under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,  but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it  explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina  this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine  seizure of South Georgia Island.       South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with  no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South  Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia  Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,  glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable.   On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or  historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it  stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.       In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by  Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took  over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,  Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,  not Britain.       But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It  has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or  Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even  more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's  leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They  were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island  could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were  setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island  was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's  military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia  Island at all?       My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,  not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an  enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation  buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island.   The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret  installation, together with two other similar installations which  I will describe shortly.       The secret military complexes have been in existence for many  years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear  war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in  Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the  details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain  and verify them.       The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of  this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat  that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.       What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of  the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The  mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the  Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are  behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of  the ""PROJECT Z"" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase  is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both  Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR  ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the  existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around  the world.       The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are  working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of  other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to  ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in  Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie  smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered  remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the  secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the  open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining  fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using  that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of  the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to  pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off  NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel  and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a  race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.       Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are  benefitting from war preparations which were started by the  Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since  the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United  States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United  States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal  power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions.   But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades  both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller  Brothers.       In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world  domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half  secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28.   It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret  while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the  details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By  deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United  States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia.   Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be  unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.       When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the  Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the  late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that  the war being planned would have very different effects on the  Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United  States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern  Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great  Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the  strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are  relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected  that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern  Hemisphere war.       In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious  radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas  not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the  war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is  very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern  Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from  the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then  it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image  of this process takes up the southern half of the planet.   Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,  but very little of the air changes places.       The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming  nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for  generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the  Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war.   This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A  quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller  cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I  discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson  Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during  the war.  He accomplished this as so-called ""Coordinator of  Hemispheric Defense"" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.   So that takes care of the South American continent and its  natural resources.       Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller  control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,  especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the  efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER  No. 36.       Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land  masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and  New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the  Rockefellers.       The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military  installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming  war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the  surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern  Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually  recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire  would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third  generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to  inherit the Earth.       In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after  the war, some means would have to be available to project  military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against  Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the  beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar  military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A  minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based  in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the  reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the  Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in  existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built  and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no  small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was  essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built.   The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and  naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the  secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear  attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered  prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.       The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection  against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all  these plans were still in the early stages of development, the  answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to  Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden  naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs  which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is  a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off  with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water  a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.       The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided  that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the  Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of  candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered  coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas  were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong.   Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the  equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too  many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy  impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for  the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.       At last the sites for the secret naval installations were  selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was  selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71  three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme  importance in the coming war.       In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand  naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located  close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South  Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes  down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the  installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,  which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island  facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.       The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since  World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even  closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location  is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep  under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also  too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New  Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South  Pacific.       In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found.   That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located  perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The  tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret  installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island.   It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of  New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island  was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the  northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from  the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain  took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down.   Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia  Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.       Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New  Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's.   The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build  other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD  installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these  techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve  construction access directly from the sea instead of overland.   In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in  appearance both during and after construction.       The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let  ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well  camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the  entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When  sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you  know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction  projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying  around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house  the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and  debris was disposed of at sea.       Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be  outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake  disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed  greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal  role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary  of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara  presided over the public paring back of America's visible  military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling  of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that  shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,  was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in  New Zealand and South Georgia Island!       The secret naval installations have been used as duplication  facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and  built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar  Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two  ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is  an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true  in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing  techniques.       The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret  installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of  certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear  powered--nuclear ""subs""; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;  and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin  was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and  for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been  financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we  constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three  carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft  whose manufacture was financed the same way!       The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are  all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the  secret naval ships possess one key difference.       Last month I revealed that the so-called ""Stealth Program"" has  succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility  shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance  by distorting light waves in its vicinity.       A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into  crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of  the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been  outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth  principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes  because there is more room for the powerful equipment that  generates the field.       After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American  Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on  earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world  domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my  friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United  States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in  control, and they are bent on war.       These secret naval installations have precipitated what is  being called the ""Falklands crisis.""    Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described  ""PROJECT Z"", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR  WAR ONE.       An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here  are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in  Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike  the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war  with Russia.       Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in  certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable  war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in  stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United  States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand  strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially  their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and  rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it  will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks  themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.       Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two  months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for  nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is  fast running out.       The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward  war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in  this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are  equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the  Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the  new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two  mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in  certain ways.       In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a  limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between  the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting  between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning  point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,  and is responsible for the so-called ""Falkland crisis"" now  dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new  relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far  short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be  settled between them, but for the time being they have called a  truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly  enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.       The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to  slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war.   If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller  cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last  summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war  timetable will also give more breathing space for additional  anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.       The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February  that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very  quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect  fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.       The exact details of the ""PROJECT Z"" war plan are not known to  either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines  are known to be as I described last month.       It was decided that military action should be devised that  would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the  Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the  Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working  together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to  devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone.   The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these  bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to  attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine  provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.       It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both  secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be  attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the  Bolshevik war plan still workable.       Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault  on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was  no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force  which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside  world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the  very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.       But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different  matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was  also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected  the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military  assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her  long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.       As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has  dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives  were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government  military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland  Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to  enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine  generals were not told everything about the situation by any  means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to  do.       As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were  promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the  shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine  hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military  assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the  troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller  cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With  these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,  the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.       On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack  plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,  landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia  Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old  buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they  also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,  always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as  expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship ""Endurance"" put 22  Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down  the Argentine flag.       The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine  Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a  boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that  South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered  that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now  came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from  Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.       During late March, Argentine military forces started  assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  ""Nothing new"",  thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out  threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed  that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine  forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this  time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine  public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims  to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next  day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia  Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance  initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of  view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were  overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13  alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint  Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.       Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine  forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected.   Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the  team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the  cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was  set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian  members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,  April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what  was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under  attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint  Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the  mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a  matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling  of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next  step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a  weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it  would be a nerve gas.       The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the  British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be  described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the  so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik  controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, ""Me, too""  any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against  Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war  plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective  countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered  that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.       Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval  armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of  the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding  around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling  would break through into the roof of the naval base in about  three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South  Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The  forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend  themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships  were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to  sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with  tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance  doors would be suicide.       On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was  seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports.   The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He  was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the  Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack  preparations.       That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other  secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina.   The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on ""Red  Alert.""  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin  base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at  sea undergoing ""sea trials"", but that still left seven (7) major  ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the  nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.       On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,  Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was  alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy.   Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from  certain officials.  He got them!       For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories  about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while  negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story.   The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as  possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived  in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The  official stories about ""slow movement"" of the British armada were  intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,  the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,  then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the  announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South  Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.       It was initially expected that advance elements of the British  fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two  weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint  Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it  was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a  shambles of the plan.       Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent  left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was  announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into  trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on  a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on  South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and  combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In  moments the ship was without any command, its communications and  radar silenced.  Then a Russian ""sub"" closed in and quickly  finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke  apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is  known, there were no survivors.       This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two  results, both important:    First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic  by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a  configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost  valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the  progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for  arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching  out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint  commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.    The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was  flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible  action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting  involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could  be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the  seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in  southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational  headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast  of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to  provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible  to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I  explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the  Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded  communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes  headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South  Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of  South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the  South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint  Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been  flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in  New Zealand!       The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by  other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out  of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos  Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he  was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top  Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have  revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did  not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four  days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded  his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, ""Time is running out.""   And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.       The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the  hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military  analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed  until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was  still out of range.       The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the  long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was  detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the  effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed  everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the  bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside  sufficiently to badly disable them.       Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging  on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands  awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to  the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect  against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the  tactics which the Russians employed.       Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships  using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF.   As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which  PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations  of the ships to the attack submarines.  The ""subs"" were armed  with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to  explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been  thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective  shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right  through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode.   Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik  Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went  their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from  around the world.       The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local  time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23.   That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public  with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was  wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught  always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning  from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian  military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret  Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,  bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific  fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By  working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won  the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.    Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression  that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real  war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are  watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That  aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been  promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.       At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing  for a public announcement that the United States will side with  Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat  up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to  fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be  explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the  Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and  tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.       Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now  concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On  all sides now we are hearing about the so-called ""nuclear freeze  movement.""  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all  kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent  months, there have even been referenda popping up on election  ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are  banding together to warn the public about what would happen if  there were a nuclear war.       We are being told that all this is just popping up  spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and  nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet  now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have  spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you  believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,  and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and  money--and plenty of it.       What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations  machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller  cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it  does, they will lose everything because they are not in a  position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the  Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is  a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in  its power to prevent a nuclear war.       The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller  cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them  and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does  not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the  Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity  right now for the Rockefellers.       The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and  they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with  the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of  the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear  war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of  reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.       The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective  with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is  renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old  dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly  provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar  campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan  Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people.   The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on  that latent fear as a tool of power.       These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands  crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller  propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that  surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new  super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the  bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new  organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working  name, though this may be changed, is the ""World Nonproliferation  Council.""  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of  nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be  to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.                           LAST MINUTE SUMMARY       Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.  In this AUDIO  LETTER I have reported on the reasons behind the so-called  Falkland Islands crisis.  The crisis erupted because of secret  Bolshevik-controlled naval installations in the Southern  Hemisphere.  These have been attacked by joint action of the  Rockefeller cartel and the Russians in an attempt to slow down  the nuclear-war timetable.  The attacks were successful, but the  results remain to be seen.  One result, though, is that the Royal  Navy has now been drawn into a trap.  Britain's Waterloo at sea  may well be at hand.       My friends, two factions are struggling for control over our  United States--the Rockefeller cartel and the Bolsheviks.  They  differ in style but both seek to control us through fear.  If we  are ever to rise above their trickery, it must be through the  power of our Lord Jesus Christ, our only hope.  As the Scripture  tells us, our Lord ""...has not given us the spirit of fear; but  of power, of love, and of a sound mind.""  We must learn to wage  peace.  As our Lord declared long ago, ""Blessed are the  peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.""       Until next month, God willing, this is Dr. Beter.  Thank you,  and may God bless each and every one of you. "

But why allow that kind  of weird format?  If those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits, then  maybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on SkipJack, if  it exists, can't be easily used to derive S1 and S2 for a whole production  run of these chips....)

Before, the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) were just  Members of National Parliaments (MNPs) elected by and from among their peers.    In the European Parliament, every Member State has a fixed number of seats,  which increases less than proportionally with the population. Once in five  years, a general European election is being held, in which the citizens of all  Member States choose their representatives to the European Parliament. Next  elections are due in 1994.    Now the voting system for these European elections still differs from one  country to another. Although the European Treaty enabling the direct election  of the MEPs requires a uniform voting system, up to now every country has just  used its own system, more or less the same one used for national elections.  British MEPs are elected in a first-past-the-post system with one MEP per  district; nearly all other States have chosen a system with proportional  representation. But then in some countries (France, Italy) MEPs are allowed to  be a MNP as well, whilst in others they are not (Belgium, Netherlands).    The European Parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its  own members, so that every candidate should have the same regulations to  comply with, regardless of the Member State (s)he wants to be elected for. I  would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions:    1. Do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every  Member State continue to use its own regulations (for European elections that  is)?    2. Do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented, with one or  more MEPs per district, or would you prefer a system with proportional  representation (for the whole of the Community or per state, per region, per  district?).    3. Do you think the European Commission (or just its president) should be  directly elected too, or should it be appointed by the European Parliament, or  by the joint Member State governments as it is now?    4. The Maastricht Treaty allows subjects of Member States to stand for  election in another Member State they are residing in. Do you think you would  or could vote for a foreigner if his/her ideas appeal to you?    5. Do you think MEPs should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament  or a regional parliament too? Or a member of a national or regional government  body?    6. The European Parliament now has meetings in both Strasbourg and Brussels.  MEPs themselves are for a complete move to Brussels in great majority, but  political compromises between the governments of the Member States stick to  the status quo. Do you approve of this or do you think the European Parliament  should meet in one city only, and if yes, which?    Please post your answers to eunet.politics, to which all followups are  automatically directed. If you do not have access to that group, please mail  your answer directly to me and I will post it for you.    I hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter.  --  Roland Siebelink - Lokaal B.034          Centrum voor de Studie van Nieuwe  Vrije Universiteit Brussel SCOM/NMIT     Media, Informatie en Telecommunicatie  Pleinlaan 2 - 1050 Brussel - Belgium     Tel. direkt:  +32.2.641 24 15  E-mail <rcsiebel@vnet3.vub.ac.be>        Tel. centrum: +32.2.641 24 12  Talk <rcsiebel@is2.vub.ac.be>            Fax centrum:  +32.2.641 28 61 "

The parts are  mostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.  We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.  Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.    The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu   as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography   FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers  every 21 days.

WordPerfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break.    The method uses XOR with two repeating key streams: a typed password    and a byte-wide counter initialized to 1+<the password length>. Full    descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli    [BER91].      Chris Galas writes: ``Someone awhile back was looking for a way to    decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution.     There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,    Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will    decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox    files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you    think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a    call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files    that have a 10 char or less pw key.''    * How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?      A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the    plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.    If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the    following:       1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.    (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of    the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal.     If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something    over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different    key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes    of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which    indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.      2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This    removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since    English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of    text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing    plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact    one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)      If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a    standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis    texts show how to break those. It's possible with those methods, in    the hands of an expert, if there's only ten times as much text as key.    See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].    * How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]      Here's one popular method, using the des command:        cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail      Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called    PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through    1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.    There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this    writing.      There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting    mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own    newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ    as well.      PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm    without a license and RSA's patent is valid only (or at least primarily)    in the USA.      RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which    is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside    the USA.      Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of    the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the    message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there    have been repeated calls for each to understand the other's formats and    algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as    we know).    * Is the UNIX crypt command secure?      No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt    breaker's workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks    on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].    * How do I use compression with encryption?      A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by    some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).      Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact    distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it's    impossible to describe ``the typical English text'' beyond coarse    characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up    more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy    has a slightly more accurate model, he'll be able to find some    redundancy in your compressed output.      Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they    have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that    actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of    UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number''    that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.        This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a    bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means    removes the need for strong encryption.      Compression after encryption is silly.    * Is there an unbreakable cipher?      Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the    one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as    plaintext.      Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be    useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by    likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is    expected to remain valid.    * What does ``random'' mean in cryptography?      Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom    number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be    cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to    predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of    the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of    0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.      A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function    of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently    random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by    the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps    generated by a hardware random number source).      Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,    generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of    entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,    	cat /dev/audio | compress - >foo      gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in    it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,    for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random    string.      When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is    important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that    because it looks complicated to a human, it must be ""random"".  For    example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be    unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a    clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.    * What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?      See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount    of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in    the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number    of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this    can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to    back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis.     Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have    multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security    from the opponent's difficulty choosing the correct one.      Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic    measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives    probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext    for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible    plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys    are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don't normally    deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine    the likelihood of events of interest.      Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than    D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not    enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of    possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,    which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to    8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but    the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work    required to find the key after approximately D characters have been    intercepted.      In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used    in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key    size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if    it's too small, but doesn't guarantee security if it's high.) Few    practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all    manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges'' to crack    some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic    considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a    recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.    Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and    information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most    promising directions.      Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information    statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal    1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the    possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].    * What is key management and why is it important?      One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in    full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,    and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of    course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling    Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)    Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can    eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in    modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are    transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but    also enough key material to cover the traffic.      Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and    handling of keys.      A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology    is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use    employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys'' and a central Key    Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that    certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control    personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and    to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the    reporting of lost CIKs.      This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management    problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,    many having to do with ``whom do you trust?''    * Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?      Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from    relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a    linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random    number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds    and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a    high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically    this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for    cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more    complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---    but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable    structure at all.      See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].    * What is the correct frequency list for English letters?      There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than    the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:    namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of    English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly'' computed,    but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.      The second answer is that the question doesn't make sense. What do    you mean by ``English letters''? The ``English language'' is not a    fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It    has changed over time; it is different between different authors.    Any particular message will have different statistics from those of    the language as a whole.      The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have    exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all    reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won't matter.    In fact there's an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics'' (other    buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods'' and ``maximum likelihood    estimation'') which studies questions like ``What's the chance that a    text with these letter frequencies is in English?'' and comes up with    reasonably robust answers.      So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will    be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.    * What is the Enigma?      ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of    information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by    the British during WWII.''      See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].    * How do I shuffle cards?      Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of    values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output    permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you    need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly    distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that    function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH    is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two    addresses given)      for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;      modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since    ranno()'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the    error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()'s    modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less    than y, go back and get another ranno() value.      * Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?      Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with    possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted    separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps    even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.      As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard    PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the    keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be    encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in    part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one    of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.      If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must    be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in    the process.  That key is useable with any copy of the CD-ROM's data.    The pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the    illegal copy.      * Can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers?      schneier@chinet.chi.il.us (Bruce Schneier) says: AccessData of Orem,    Utah sells products that break the password scheme of a number of    popular Macintosh and PC software packages.

2,"Nntp-Posting-Host: starfighter.den.mmc.com    Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and  relaunching it:    (Caution: speculation mode engaged)  There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.  I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in  order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed  items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not  retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would  have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this  might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due  to thermal cycle stresses...)    I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the  HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are  much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged  (I assume that they were caged for launch)?    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Michael Corvin 	      				zwork@starfighter.den.mmc.com  GN&C R&D					Martin Marietta Astronautics  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  ===============    My views, not Martin Marietta's   ========================  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- "

2,"  In article <ls8lnvINNrtb@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu       (Russell Turpin) writes:  >            ...   >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does*  >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are  >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and  >which are not.)    To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So  there's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a  given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely  and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums  of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other  hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which  eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies  contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  ""You people call  THIS science?""   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both  these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)      Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor  appropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is   ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.        My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make  extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using  methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this  is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach  their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.    Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before  the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is  famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later   mathematicians did prove them, of course.)      I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not  so much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a   matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of   incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to   objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an  essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step   of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward   that goal then one is not doing science.)    When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and  seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also  worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further  investigation.      In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote:   > Namely, is there really justification for the belief that  > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?      Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable  amount of effort in a ""serious scholarly investigation"" such as I  suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately   specific question to try and answer.      The ""science"" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science   currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.    I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use   of ""reason and observation.""    One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether  in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced  practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.      Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with  the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there   is any existing research related to this question.      --  In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems   less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.       lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet "

No, they do not work well.  My doctor started using one recently, and I  thought the concept was so amazing that I bought one too.      The thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.  The ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls, so you have to point  the thing very carefully.  This means tugging on the top of the ear  to straighten out the ear canal, then inserting the thing snugly, then  pushing a button.  Unfortunately, there are many things that can go wrong.  It is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on   yourself.  I get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees,  and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.      I talked to one of the nurses in my doctor's office recently about this,  and she said she didn't like them either, for same reasons.  She did give  me some instruction on how to tug on my ear, and what correct insertion  feels like, but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly  on one's self.  She also said that she and other nurses had complained to  the company about inaccurate readings, and that someone from the company  had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end  of the probe with alcohol from time to time.  She demonstrated this prior  to reading my temperature, and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree  of the oral temperature I took at home before driving to the Dr's office.    I have also noticed tha some nurses click the button, then remove the  probe immediately.  This causes wrong readings.  In my experience, you  have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button  to get a good measurement.  The nurse I talked with agreed.  I suspect  that many people don't realize this, and therefore get bad readings for  yet another reason.    In short, it's a great idea.  It may work for some folks, but I believe  it doesn't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.   "

1,"  Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the  _Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television  station, KTVB Channel 7.    Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.    Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.    Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that  Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National  Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge  asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because  of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.    The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently  ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither  by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.    The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,  who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person  named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as  an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms  in his dealings with Randy Weaver.    Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an  Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two  then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in  time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons  transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he  (Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the  White cause.""    The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and  later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second  meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to  tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-  gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of  19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge  shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of  24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel  length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver  is reported to have said that he could perform better work once  his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility  of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars  for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty  dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have  simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -  over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).    The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that  his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead  of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver  suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in  Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince  Weaver otherwise.    The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were  made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these  meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also  reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki  Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must  have also been phone taps.    These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and  loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's  attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to  make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a  case at all..."" according to the rules.    Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his  wife's voice on the tape.    U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear  accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the  Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect  this trial is not explained.    Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning  Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are  surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were  surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained  in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy  Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that  Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report  that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming  at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics  are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the  only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and  Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that  Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.    Tuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial.   Kenneth Fadeley's testimony is scheduled to continue.    "

For me there is  a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to  be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not  put on too much weight. When I get too fat, I just diet/exercise  more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the  extra weight. Usually I cycle within a 15 lb range, but  smaller and larger cycles occur as well. I'm always afraid  that this method will stop working someday, but usually  I seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.  This is one reason I have a hard time accepting the notion  of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting  (that results in long-term weight gain). I have been cycle-  dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.    I think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward  keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.    Brian "

Agreed. No agency such as the NSA (or whoever) would approve the public   release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technical  means or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. Surely the whole  point of all this madness is to make Joe Public think that his/her  communications will be kept safe, while James Bond at the NSA can, if need  be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications? That'll be  quite a heist, if they can pull it off.       I thought that the US Government were going to release the algorithm to a  panel of ""carefully chosen experts"", who would then ""study it deeply, and  report their findings""? Exactly who will these people be? Academics? Or  Government-sponsored researchers? Tiny-toons?    > I, for one, and quite scared of this kind of thing, and plan to support   > organizations (and even disorganizations) who are fighting against this  > Clipper Chip in any way that I can.

Mr. Jefferson would be clearly disappointed in your designation of   him as author of the bill of rights.  And your reference to those  in Israel was condesceding and inappropriate.  The Declaratio of Independence of 1776 was written by Thomas Jefferson.  In 1787, the Constitution was drafted by 55 men in Philadelphia.  In 1791, the Bill of Rights was added.  Well, maybe Jefferson  would be flattered.    As to you guys at UVA, your right, not all of you are anti-Jewish,  or self-hating.

1,"  Flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  A fire will  start small and in one location and heat the air.  The temperature in  the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches  fire at once.     This may have occurred in the BD compound, I have heard reports that  the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed  by those outside the compound.  When the fire got big enough, and  broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but  was really one big fire.     Because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building  it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free  of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.  When they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them  to escape.  They were trapped by the flames in their safe room.     I find it hard to believe that the FBI was not recording the final  assault.  I think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show  their agents of the the FBI overcoming the ""forces of evil"", aka  the Branch Davidians.  The tapes would also allow the FBI to prove  that they were not using excessive force.       --  Rod Anderson  N0NZO            | The only acceptable substitute  Boulder, CO                    | for brains is silence.  rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu         |       -Solomon Short-  satellite  N0NZO on ao-16      | "

He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin  for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed  foods. Mother's milk was well below the effective dose.      >>Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his*  >>sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.  >  >Impeccable.

Mr. Cramer, when are you going to stop indulging in such blatant lies?  This is not only not true, you know damned well that it's not true.  None  of your research supports this; no mental health expert has taken this  position.  This is *your own* opinion which is not backed up by any  research or any knowledge.    According to one survey, done in San Francisco, the number of heterosexual  men who were molested as children was on the order of 5%.  The number of  homosexual men who were molested as children was on the order of 8%.  Source:  a book on sexual abuse of children by David Finkelhor (sorry,  the title escapes me).

Oh, you definitely have a choice.  You realize, of course, that you  are approaching the two-year anniversary of your crusade.  How are  you planning on celebrating two years of lies?    Incidentally, we are still waiting your crusade against African-Americans,  women, and other minorities who also want to ""impose their morality on  others"".  After all, they also want the government to ""tell peaceful  people how to live.""  Therefore, you really ""have no choice"", but to  continue to point out that being a woman or an African-American is not  a lifestyle, but a sickness.    It's bullshit, Mr. Cramer.  It was bullshit when you began this crusade  and it's still bullshit.  I am continually amazed at the depths to which  you'll stoop to carry on this deliberate attack.

2,"  I have never worked with really small signals before and have a few   questions about low level noise.  I have noticed that the waveform   synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large  common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another  transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred   times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to  make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with   line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).    How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an  HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to   'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the   input since it will read accurately down to DC.    Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem,   how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected   to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused   by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for   use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would  appreciate it.   "

ATHENS, Greece - An array of representatives of Greek political parties,  including the ruling PASOK party, and a host of political groups, both  Armenian and non-Armenian, joined to voice their solidarity with the   Armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new  Armenian political force were voiced here on Sunday, April 20 during  the 2nd International Meeting of Solidarity with the Armenian People. And  judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these  political groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian  Cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.    The International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of  the Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed  by younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the  armed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia  (ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern  countries and the United States although some of these branches appear to  have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks  of ASALA...    Voicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian  people, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of  the party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...  Explaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement   was Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam   Abu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued   support of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause,   pledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be   open to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle. Later, Mr.   Abu-Salim, answering a question put to him by this writer, affirmed that   his organization had always trained Armenian members of ASALA and that  this policy will continue. ""The doors of our camps are always open to   Armenian freedom fighters,"" he affirmed.    Among the prominent Greek politicians who attended the conference was the son  of Prime Minister Papandreou, who himself holds a post in the Greek cabinet;  two members of the Cypriot Parliament who had journeyed to Athens for the  specific purpose of attending the international gathering; representatives of  the Christian Democratic party, EDIK Center party, two wings of the Communist  party, representatives of an assortment of labor unions and trade associations,  a number of mayors of Greek towns and cities; two Greek members of the  European Parliament and other members of the Greek Parliament were also among  those who participated in the international conference. Also on hand to follow  the deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.    More than significant was the large number of messages received by the   organizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary  Movement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation  Movement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist  Labor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other  international groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-  Palestinian conflict.                     SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM    Among messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary  Federation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction  and assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to  foreign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the  Armenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will  continue to ""reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,""  to expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag ""Bureau.""  The message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that  exists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,  open supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.    The Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the  Greek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.  The headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have  turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who  prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...

Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the  Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in  particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The  arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions  are particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the  blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin,  which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development,  especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less  sensitive to Glu than humans, have been observed: after ingesting Glu,  on a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood  levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release  of steroids becomes flattened.

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring  and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener  and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever  scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on   the frontend.    Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm  equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets  dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly  12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that  far down is probably a big no-no.

2,"  First off, if I'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,  not humans.    Secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  This is an  uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  Put in layman's  terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be  turned into heat.    2,4-DNP was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  In controlled  amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the  reduced amount of useful energy available.  It is very dangerous.  It would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than  play around with 2,4-DNP.    But if you insist, I suggest you look up the literature in your own  university library.  You can obtain 2,4-DNP by taking a first year  organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's  a commonly-used reagent). "

The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)  orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.

I would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might  wait until I express an opinion before deciding I should be flamed for it.  As for 'war' I am not sure how I would define it. If you just look at attacks  on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you  count the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally  think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires  organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.  Perhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was  so. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone  organisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause  for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the  'Zionist' camp.    >Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.

As I stated, religion    There are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.  The name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form 'Armina'  or 'Aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.  The following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun  cuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).     1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam 'Armeniya'.     6. On reaching Arminam 'Armeniya'.     7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya 'Armeniya'.    According to Karakashian:    As for 'Armenia', the equivalent of the 'Armin' or 'Arminik' of the Persians,  this is more recent than the word 'Ararat', and is to be found used in  the Dara inscriptions for 'Haiastan'.      Saint Martin:    The name 'Armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all  the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians  as 'Haiastan'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs  as Ermeniyye.     Others believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as 'Harminap'  which was later modified by the Persians to 'Arminia'. 'Ar' refers to a  place, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror,   while 'men' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and   therefore 'Armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.    G. Alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary ""Haik""  is the diminutive form of ""Hai"", and that ""Hai"" is the name of our  nation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word ""Armen"" that  foreigners apply to our people.'    It would thus appear that 'Armenia' is a place-name, that 'Armen' is   the name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way  connected with the word 'Hai'.    Haik and Haiastan:    Armenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom  the Armenian people took the name 'Hai'. But the mere resemblance  between the words 'Haik' and 'Hai' constitutes no real proof, and,  in any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of  Khoren.    Haiasa:    The following studies show quite clearly that 'Hai' and 'Haiasa' were  no more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the   region known as Armenia.    Professor Hachadurian: 'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite  inscriptions for Upper Armenia.'    Yensen, in his 'Hittites and Armenians' tries to prove that 'Hai' is  identical with the Hittite 'Hatio', in other words that 'Hai' is a  Hittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown  that 'Hai' was derived from 'Hatio'.    Mortman's attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with   no success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.    The resemblance between the words 'Haiasa' and 'Haiastan' is so obvious  that we may well accept 'Haiasa' as the oldest form of 'Haiastan'.    Let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'Hai', 'Haikazan' and  'Haiastan' entered our older works.    According to Karakashian:     'The word ""Haik"" is never to be found employed with reference to a  leader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it  ever found employed in the forms ""Haika"" or ""Haykazn"".    Agahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he  improved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred  to a nation and had been derived from ""Hai"" or ""Haik"" they could   also have used the words ""Haikak"" and ""Haykazn"" in a number of  places.'    According to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite   inscriptions:    'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality  or species. The words ""Haddanas"", ""Haddina"" were used by the   Assyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the  ""d"" between the two ""a"" letters to ""y"" ""Hadinasdani"" was in this  way transformed to ""Haiastan""'.    Professor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards  the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'Hai'  and 'Haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a   solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'Haiasa'   which is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.  Forrer takes 'Haiasa' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case  it seems likely that 'Haiasa' was actually a part of Armenia. The  suffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is 'Hayasa', which  refers to the country of the 'Hayasas'.    E. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological   and Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.    The Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost  all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,  above average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties  with certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.    According to J. Deniker:    From the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be  regarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are   descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their  average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.  They are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of   85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic  family.    Professor Rene Vernont writes as follows:    The Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,  but some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little  above average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often  a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth.     Investigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between  Armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics  led him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a   distinct race.    Serdar Argic                               'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                               might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                               and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I realize many of the disorders I listed (such as ""muscle spasm"" !!) are  vaguely defined and may encompass a wide range of particular disorders.  My  apologies; the list was provided to me as is.  I have some numbers, but not  reliable.      Any ideas on sources or, even bbetter, any actual figures (with source  listed)?

No.  As a result of wars brought by the Arabs against the Jews in an attempt to  annihilate Israel, the Arabs have lost their claim to land there.

I always like your kind of odds. The Greek governments must be held   to account for the sub-human conditions of the Turkish minority living   in the Western Thrace under the brutal Greek domination. The religious   persecution, cultural oppression and economical ex-communication applied   to the Turkish population in that area are the dimensions of the human   rights abuse widespread in Greece.    ""Greece's Housing Policies Worry Western Thrace Turks""    ...Newly built houses belonging to members of the minority  community in Dedeagac province, had, he said, been destroyed  by Evros province public works department on Dec. 4.

""Greece Government Rail-Roads Two Turkish Ethnic Deputies""    While World Human Rights Organizations Scream, Greeks   Persistently Work on Removing the Parliamentary Immunity  of Dr. Sadik Ahmet and Mr. Ahmet Faikoglu.    In his 65-page confession, Salman Demirok, a former chief of PKK  operations in Hakkari confessed that high-level relations between  PKK, Greece and Greek Cypriot administration existed.    According to Demirok, Greek Cypriot administration not only   gives shelter to PKK guerillas but also supplies them with   food and weapons at the temporary camps set up in its territory.   Demirok disclosed that PKK has three safe houses in South Cyprus,   used by terrorists such as Ferhat. In the camps, he added,   terrorists were trained to use various weapons including RPG's   and anti-aircraft guns which had been purchased directly from   the Greek government. Greek Cypriot government has gone to the   extent of issuing special identification cards to PKK members so   that they can travel from one region to another without being   confronted by legal obstacles. Demirok's account was confirmed   by another PKK defector, Fatih Tan, who gave himself over to   police in Hakkari after spending four years with PKK. Tan explained  that the terrorists went through a training in camps in South Cyprus,   sometimes for a period of 12 weeks or more.

""Abu Nidal's Advisers"" Reportedly Training                    ""PKK & ASALA Militants"" in Cyprus           Nicosia, Ankara,  Tel Aviv. The Israeli  secret service,         Mossad,  is   reported  to  have   acquired  significant         information in connection  with the camps set  up in the         Troodos  mountains   in  Cyprus  for  the   training  of         militants of the PKK and ASALA {Armenian Secret Army for         the Liberation  of Armenia}. According to  sources close         to Mossad, about 700 Kurdish, Greek Cypriot and Armenian         militants  are   undergoing  training  in   the  Troodos         mountains in  southern Cyprus.  The same  sources stated         that Abu  Nidal's special  advisers are  giving military         training to  the PKK and  ASALA militants in  the camps.         They added that the  militants leave southern Cyprus for         Libya, Lebanon, Syria, Greece  and Iran after completing         their training.  Mossad has established that  due to the         clashes  which were  taking  place  among the  terrorist         groups based  in Syria, the PKK  and ASALA organisations         moved to  the Greek Cypriot  part of Cyprus,  where they         would  be  more  comfortable. They  also  transferred  a         number of  their camps in  northern Syria to the Troodos         mountains.           Mossad  revealed that  the  Armenian National  Movement,         which is known as the MNA, has opened liaison offices in         Nicosia, Athens and  Tripoli in order to  meet the needs         of the  camps. The offices are used to provide  material         support for the  Armenian  camps. Meanwhile, the  leader         of the  Popular Front for  the Liberation of  Palestine,         George  Habash, is  reported  to  have ordered  his  men         not  to   participate  in  the  operations  carried  out         by  the  PKK &  ASALA, which  he  described  as ""extreme         racist,  extreme  nationalist  and   fascist.""  Reliable         sources have said that  Habash believed that  the recent         operations carried  out by the PKK  militants  show that         organisation  to  be a  band  of  irregulars  engaged in         extreme  nationalist  operations.  They  added  that  he         instructed  his militants  to sever their links with the         PKK  and avoid clashing with it. It has been established         that George Habash  expelled ASALA  militants  from  his         camp  after ASALA's  connections  with  drug trafficking         were exposed.

Special to The New York Times    ATHENS, June 26 - A dispute developed today between Athens and   Washington over United States intelligence reports saying that   Athens, for several months, conducted negotiations with the  terrorist known as Abu Nidal...    They said the contacts were verified in what were termed hard  intelligence reports.    Abu Nidal leads the Palestinian splinter group Al Fatah   Revolutionary Council, implicated in the 1985 airport   bombings at Rome and Vienna that contributed to the Reagan   Administration's decision to bomb Tripoli, Libya, last year.    In Washington, State Department officials said that when  Administration officials learned about the contacts, the  State Department drafted a strongly worded demarche. The  officials also expressed unhappiness with Greece's dealings  with ASALA, the Armenian Liberation Army, which has carried  out terrorist acts against Turks....

Anybody know?    I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.    Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.  Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other  algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on  a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something  like DES) for the encryption.    How could the ""back door"" keys work in this system?  I can see a few  possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that  the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door  keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers  used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.    Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips  simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own  internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys  usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's  secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be  identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most  straightforward to me.)    Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the  message itself has a ""dual key"" property, that possession of either of  two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from  the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.    It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised  during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and  December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would  participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into  what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early  knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with  Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.

Two groups that the government insure are the elderly and the ""medically an  needy"" (those who have impoverished themselves through spending for medical  care).  The typical elderly person spends 3.5 times what a person under age  65.  The typical medically needy person spends about 10 times what the  average person does.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard  Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.    Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just received:    John Sorenson  Carol Sigelman  Carla Moore  Barbara Moose  Judith Schrier    Again, thank you to all who gave!    I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to   review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.    It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett   Packard Scanners.      When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;   (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)   automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.     I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which   parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.    Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The   software gives you two ""errors"" at this point.  Blue which are words that were   converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.    Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn't think it converted   correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more   credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,   you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal   dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,   considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.     After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word   processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a   seperate TIFF or PCX file format.    I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.    While most of my faxes were received in ""standard"" mode (200x100 dpi), the   accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.     Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the   limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just   too small.     If anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has   been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,   Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus,   Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences   of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,   malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,   control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug   resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,   salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging   infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those   in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and   minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of   emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more   effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs   (3).        This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, ""Emerging Infectious   Diseases."" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as   surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and   public health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation   of an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4).     References    1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that   identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from   one restaurant chain. Washington        On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of   Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an   increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a   case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or   postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls   implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset   (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January   18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants   was initiated.        As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-  February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the   state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case   definition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS   (Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with   confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of   symptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A   restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients   who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating   a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17   through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30   developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years   (range: 0-74 years). Idaho        Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,   Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-  confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December   11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were   hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13   (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California        In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was   notified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died.   Active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with   E. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993.   Four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was   reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%   increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January   1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as   postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,   or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with   onset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.        Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The   outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen   persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median   age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of   the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community   controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched   OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients   who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-  sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).   Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada        On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten   at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District   issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea   contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody   diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness   with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with   onset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local   laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools   for E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After   SMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of   one patient 38 days after illness onset.        Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine   were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range:   0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-  matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during   the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence   limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients   also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-  49.8). Other Investigation Findings        During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases   primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November   19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in ""jumbo"" patties produced on   November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11   lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed   to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672   (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.        A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the   United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing   the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter   plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one   slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.        Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in   families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first   identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody   diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since   emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common   cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked   most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other   food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been   implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter   study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7   that organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10   participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a   higher rate than for any other pathogen.        Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most   clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    SMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses   associated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea   (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups   and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and   complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients   develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,   renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.        This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community   outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite   the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in   three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington   (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from   persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5).   When infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported   to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public   health action to prevent further cases.        E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can   contaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.   Department of Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service to identify   critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce   the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply.   Because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with   pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens   from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be   internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook   ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices   are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played   an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim   recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to   155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).        Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report   and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be   consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of   outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of   this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections   caused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E.   coli O157:H7.

Long-term use of   smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of   oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who   currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).   To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,   CDC's 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease   Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing   tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,   noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This   report summarizes findings from this survey.        The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked ""Have you used snuff at least 20   times in your entire life?"" and ""Do you use snuff now?"" Similar questions were   asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of   smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco   use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the   time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having   used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the   time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and   former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at   least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as   those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not   smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on   smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or   equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide   national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using   standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)   (3).        In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users   of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)   women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco   use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was   highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was   highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of   smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan   Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American   Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of   smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was   substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in   rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only   for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).        Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those   aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of   chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although   women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest   among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.        An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being   former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were   former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons   aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users   (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%   CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users   was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%   95% CI=68.9-78.1).        Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)   currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%   CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%   CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.        Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%   95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-  49.6).     Reported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease   Prevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National   Center for Health Statistics, CDC.     Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless   tobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in   particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that   link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral   snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this   behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for   nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).        Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among   racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels   and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require   further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role   in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the   differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).        In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current   smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the   prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco   users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous   study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked   reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to   stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health   implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.        The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special   population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless   tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year   2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more   than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the   prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless   tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,   enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes   commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to   routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based   prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit   tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it  was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.  Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.

It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building  Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, ""This  second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope  with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve  the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away.""   Japan's 8.3-meter  Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes  will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!    And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research  was done with ""Star Wars"" funding, and some is now being shared with  astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few  years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their   theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.    To say that ""visible light astronomy is already a dying field"" is   pure hokum.  To use the ""logic"" that things are already bad, so it doesn't  matter if it gets worse is absurd.

1,"            I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majority  of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem  to be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some   interest to any of them.          It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great  respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why   they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery  to me (personally, I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier)  - but perhaps it's an accident of history.          Anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different  jews. According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph,  while in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah.            Who's right and why the name difference? I'm really curious.                  David. "

0,"  Short summary of what Bellovin says Hellman says the NSA says: There is  a global key G, plus one key U_C for each chip C. The user can choose a  new session key K_P for each phone call P he makes. Chip C knows three  keys: G, its own U_C, and the user's K_P. The government as a whole  knows G and every U_C. Apparently a message M is encrypted as  E_G(E_{U_C}(K_P),C) , E_{K_P}(M). That's it.    The system as described here can't possibly work. What happens when  someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? To get M  the receiving chip needs K_P; to get K_P the receiving chip needs U_C.  The only information it can work with is C. If U_C can be computed  from C then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key  escrow'' is bullshit. Otherwise how is a message decrypted?    ---Dan "
2,"  When constructing active filters,  odd values of resistor are often required   (i.e. something like a 3.14 K Ohm resistor).(It seems best to choose common   capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded).    Is there a PD program out there that will work out how best to make up such  a resistance, given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade?.(1,  1.2,1.5,1.8,2.2,3.3 etc ).  It is a common enough problem,  yet I cant   recall seing a program that tells that Rx+Ry//Rz gives Rq,  starting with   q and finding prefered values x,y and z.      			Cheers  				Ian H     "

Congradulations tim. I think the other people answered  you on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal  conflicts policy).   	Israel very often gets away with more  than most other nations (Due to U.S. vetos). While I am not  familiar with every instance I know that the reason Saudi  Arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the  pilgrims were iranian. Yes, the UN is biased but mostly in  favor of the US and its allies (Including Israel, Saudi Arabia  and Pakistan) and against ""Outlaw"" countries like iran and more  recently Iraq. Far be it from me to support the repressive  governments there but I think they get more slack than Israel  for things they do ""wrong"". Again the reason some condemnations  don't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. The  gassed Iraqi kurds got associated with Iran in the war and  since Iran was perceived as worse than Iraq no condemnation  resulted. The palestinians killed by arab countries involved  another case of who cares. It seems that until very recently no  one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including  in Israel and the occupied territories).  	Again I appreciate the lack of personal insults. "

Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never  be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no  materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids  and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low  grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,   and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat   sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military  weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space   travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as   Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor   activity in the global scope of things.    Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent  calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's  too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories  that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna  has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital  sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers  a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,  and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and  heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity  wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.    We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually  ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to  deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more  expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the  easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few  centuries, if not much longer.    Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio  astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site  of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for  defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is  unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.  The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good  enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for  conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a  bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little  ultimate profit either.

So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you, Master of Wsidom,   							       ^^^  ------------------------------------------------------------------  If you insist on giving me names/titles I did not ask for you could at  least spell them correctly. /sigh.       when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that      the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE,      and hence ALL their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on      the ground of occupied territories.    No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I'm merely asking you whether the existance  of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right  to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the   question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have   not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.       What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my     point in the post, that you ""responded to"". The point is that since Israel      is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights      to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic      deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.    If a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then   tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?       |> |> In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others      |> |> territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or      |> |> unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights.        |> Such as the right to live? That's nice. The swedish government is a group     |> of people that rule me by force. Does that give me the right to kill     |> them?       Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?    Worthy or not, I was just applying your logic to a related problem.  Am I to assume you admit it wouldn't hold?       |> |> What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue?     |> |> The answer is to be found in a certain system such as International law,     |> |> US law, Israeli law ,...       |> And now it's very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a      |> point.. Excuse me while I throw up.       ok, Master of Wisdom is throwing up.      You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !    Oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?  I'll let you in on a secret... It's not for real.. Take my word for it.       |> |> It seems that the US law -represented by US State dept in this case-     |> |> is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories.     |> |> Anyway, as for Hamas, then obviously they turned to the islamic system.       |> And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?       The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because     any system can solve it.      The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine).     I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for   all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won't repeat that   mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I'm eagerly awaiting your   reply.       Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization)      said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:  	   ""Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both  	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal  						^^^                  ^^^  	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.  	   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of  	   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than  	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to  	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be   	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to  	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.""  				   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967  				   (""Courtesy"" of Marc Afifi)    Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to   getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS  charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information I'd  be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to   a _private_ paper even older? I'm not going to get into the question if he  wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have  their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will  make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It's those who are willing to   make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get   something back.         ""We"" and ""our"" either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which).        Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the      imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !       I think that is fair enough .    No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve   the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.  Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land.          ""The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children"".  			   -Rabbi Shoham.    Oh, and by the way, let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are  a real bummer, when I try giving your posts any credit.  --    --------------------------------------------------------  Jonas Flygare, 		+ Wherever you go, there you are  V{ktargatan 32 F:621	+  754 22 Uppsala, Sweden	+ "

If I forgot or botched your  favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not*  on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure  it out, I'll add it to the list.    Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*  acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated  every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)    The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All  comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.    Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your  own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of  acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that  are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.  Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of  the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply  different ways of referring to the same thing.    Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of  the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),  who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in  character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),  who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and  terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).    Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA  Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and  Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly  mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.    Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program  written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the  acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government  is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests.  As a   left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as  you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto  dealers.      But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,  to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,  and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a   particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special  interests cannot influence public policy.

1,"  Just to follow up on Casper's posting. I have been following this business  since it started 52 days ago.  The Branch Davidians have occupied the Mt.  Carmel location for some years, and their neighbors (you know, the people  next door) have said to a man, that the BD folks were quiet and never  bothered anybody.    There were some defector from the BD who alleged child abuse within the  movement, but how does this bring in the Feds? In particular what interest  would ATF have in child abuse. O.K. It was the allegation of possesing  illegal automatic weapons.  A search warrant could have been obtained  (properly) only on probable cause. This means that some evidence that an  illegal auto weapon was shipped in, or an illegal kit for converting  semi-auto weapons to full automatic was purchased or shipped.    In either case, how does this require an NO-KNOCK warrent, with a bunch of  macho hot dog assholes busting into the place *without* identifying  themselves. Milleniests tend to be a bit paranoid anyway. It is no  surprise they shot when invaded. Hell I am not a religious extremist and I  might have done the same myself. If the DEA busted into my house by  mistake without identifying themselve and I had a gun in my hand, I would  shoot first and wonder later.    So if it was illegal guns, the ATF should have gotten a normal warrant  (how can you flush a 50 calibre machine gun down the toilet?) and  presented it in a peaceful normal way. David Koresh has had brushes with  the law, even standing trial for attempted murder in which he was  acquitted. In every prior brush with the law, Koresh and his people acted  peacibly. There was no prior action on the part of the BD folks to  indicate that they were any danger to society.    NOTE: The question of whether the BD people were religious extremists or  slight daft is totally irrelevant. It is *not* against the law to be  looney or zany.    Look and learn folks. And be VERY afraid.    Conan the Libertarian      --   ""If you can't love the Constitution, then at least hate the Government""   "

There are *lots* of military targets in Israel.  There are  lots of legitamate targets in Israel.  Old ladies, children, and  civilians in general are not acceptable targets.    	If the only person you can kill is a civilian, you hold your  fire.  If that means you can't kill anyone, then you can't kill  anyone.  Claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they  are easy kills is rediculous.    >If Irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that  >they might obtain some objective, I'm sure they would have done so.    	Did they make a policy of it?    >I also don't  >exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism.    	Did you mean excuse? :)  Killing a soldier and killing a  civilian are two very different acts.    >The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with  >regards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups made  >a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and  >fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued  >presence in Palestine.    	No, they killed soldiers so that the British government would  leave.  The objective was not to scare civilains, but show that the cost  of staying was way too high.      	In contrast, a terrorist kills civilains to scare other  civilains.  They use random violence against people to make a point  that no one is safe until their demands are met.  An analogy would be  the Irgun blowing up Harrods or 10 Downing.    >  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me, and not much removed from  >Arab terrorism.    	Thats because you missed the essential point of arab  terrorism, which is to scare civilains away from Israel, by killing  those who have something to do with Israel.  It is to kill Jews  because they might be Zionists.  It is to kill people who live in  Israel because of where they live.  The targets are rarely soldiers,  or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of  duty, but innocent civilians, to underscore the message that no one  who deals with Israel is safe.    >	I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but  >I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they  >were a bit screwed.    	Oh, you mean you favor the Israelis, outnumbered 2 to 1,  outgunned, surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a  peace treaty in 45 years?  You favor the Jews, people like Leon  Klofhinger, a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was Jewish?  You support the right of the Jewish people to live in peace?

2,"  Getting back to the original question in this thread:    I experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those  described.  In my case, it turned out that I was developing Type I  diabetes.  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from my  doctor, I think that the breathing problem was associated with the  presence of ketones due to the diabetes.    I think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting  their food intake drastically.  I don't know if this relevant in this  case, but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating  properly.  --   Steve Kirchoefer                                             (202) 767-2862  Code 6851                                      kirchoefer@estd.nrl.navy.mil  Naval Research Laboratory                       Microwave Technology Branch  Washington, DC  20375-5000              Electronics Sci. and Tech.

Once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing  the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.    Basicaly Ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass.

I must congratulate your analytical and excellent  reportage about  Diana. From  the writings  of tye  biographers  you  quoted,  I can  perceive,  maybe  chauvinistically,  the  remnants of  her  Armenian  genes. Even  though she  is only  1/64th Armenian,  she   seems   to   have   many   of   the   strong  characteristics  of Armenian  women. Her  Armenian  ancestry is  traced to Eliza Kewark  (an Armenian  from  India), who  married  the Scottish  merchant  Thedore Forbes.  From the union was  born Kathleen  Scott  Forbes,  who  married  James  Crombie  from  Aberdeen. They  had a  daughter Jane,  who married  David  Littlejohn.  Their  daughter  Ruth  married  William Gill. Ruth Silvia Gill, the grandmother of  Lady  Diana,   married  Lord  Fermoy,   and  their  daughter, Frances  Ruth Burke Roache,  married the  eight Earl of Spencer, who  was the father of Lady  Diana.

You have set up straw horses and knocked them down. I'm not impressed.  Anyway, the Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,  massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly   people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated   the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between   1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today   in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide   that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought   they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the   Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian   terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle   resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent  Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that   they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia   today.      Source: Stanford J.

""Knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,   Armenians looked to Russia and Europe for the fulfillment of their aims.   Armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the First   World War with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse   to serve their state, the Ottoman Empire, and to assist instead other   invading Russian armies. Their hope was their participation in the Russian   success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of   Ottoman territories. Armenian political leaders, army officers, and common   soldiers began deserting in droves.""    ""With the Russian invasion of eastern Anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of   World War I, the degree of Armenian collaboration with the Ottoman's enemy   increased drastically.

Call   waiting is an optional service, but having the number ""3"" work on one's phone  is a basic service. Just because some nutcase doesn't happen to use the ""3""  on his phone, since none of the numbers he calls has a ""3"" in it, doesn't mean   that he has the right to demand that the phone company ""unbundle"" the charges  for the use of each phone digit; an unbundling that would be horrendously  inefficient because of all the billing & bookkeeping overhead. Similarly,   abortion can be seen as a ""basic service"".    Furthermore, public funding of abortion SAVES money, as well as being, in the   views of a substantial portion of the population, probably a clear majority,   an ethical thing to do. If you don't like saving money on your taxes in that   way, why don't you take the taxes you save and invest in private charities   with programs that help reduce the NEED for abortion. If every pro-lifer did   the same, it would create a massive economic negative feedback loop which   would all but ELIMINATE the need for public funding of abortion. Then you   would get your wish. And, you know what? No pro-choicer I know would stop  you carrying out that plan. They might even HELP you with it...    								- Kevin "

Doing this in anything like reasonable time would require more  propulsion capability than we can manage.  You would have to boost to  Pluto and then slow back down.

The prisoners would ""communicate""  with other distant sections (sometimes 50-100 yards away) by  taking stones, tying written notes to the stones, and throwing  them with incredible precision to other sections.

The idea of the U.S, or any other nation, taking action, i.e., military  intervention, in Bosnia has not been well thought out by those who   advocate such action. After the belligerants are subdued, it would require  an occupation force for one or two generations. If you will stop and  think about it, you will realize that these people have never forgotten  a single slight or injury, they have imbibed hatred with their mother's  milk. If we stop the fighting, seize and destroy all weapons, they will  simply go back to killing each other with clubs. And the price for this  futility will be the lives of the young men and women we send there to  die.

All of the Jewish people  that I have known as friends were not brought up to hate. To be wary of  others, most certainly, but not to hate. And except for the Warsaw  uprising, they were unarmed (and even in Warsaw badly out-gunned).  It is very easy to speak of muscle when they are someone else's muscles.  Suppose we do this thing, what will you tell the parents, wives, children,  lovers of those we are sending to die? That they gave their lives in some noble cause? Noble cause, separating some mad dogs who will turn on them.    Well, I will offer you some muscle. Suppose we tell them that they have  one week (this will give foreign nationals time to leave) to cease  their bloodshed. At the end of that week, bring in the Tomahawk firing  ships and destroy Belgrade as they destroyed the Bosnian cities. Perhaps  when some of their cities are reduced to rubble they will have a sudden  attack of brains.

2,"  Archive-name: space/data  Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:07 $    ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.      INTRODUCTION        A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and      other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.      A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the      remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as      providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on      the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP      directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via      email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com      or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions      on how to make requests.        The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames      SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.        Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is      huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.      VIEWING IMAGES        The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly      large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To      read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,      use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu      (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP      sites.        The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image      formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document      is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at      pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory      pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.      ONLINE ARCHIVES        NASA AMES        Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via      anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and      a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press      releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please      note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.        FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in      pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the      archive (the index is about 200K by itself).        To access the archives by email, send a letter to      archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the      subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:    	send SPACE Index  	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.        The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in      caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use      one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this      section for images or programs.        The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image      disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The      disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are      available in these collections.        The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory      contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in      the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is      found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).        The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to      contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing      specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.        Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee      (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).          NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM        The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and      provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data      from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140      data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can      be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS      also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,      ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to      query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,      keywords, title words, or abstract text words.        ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to      become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and      ""QuickStart"" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu      in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).        Contact Carolyn Stern Grant (stern@cfa.harvard.edu).          NASA JET PROPULSION LAB (MISSION INFORMATION AND IMAGES)        pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) is an anonymous FTP site operated by      the JPL Public Information Office, containing news releases, status      reports, fact sheets, images, and other data on JPL missions.

NASA LANGLEY (TECHNICAL REPORTS)        techreports.larc.nasa.gov is an anonymous FTP site offering technical      reports. To get started, cd to directory pub/techreports/larc/92 and      retrieve files README and abstracts.92. Most files are compressed      PostScript. The reports are also in a WAIS database with the following      description:    	(:source  	 :version 3  	 :ip-name ""techreports.larc.nasa.gov""  	 :tcp-port 210  	 :database-name ""nasa-larc-abs""  	 :cost 0.00  	 :cost-unit :free  	 :maintainer ""M.L.Nelson@LaRC.NASA.GOV""  	 :description ""NASA Langley Research Center Technical Reports        Contact tr-admin@techreports.larc.nasa.gov.          NASA SPACELINK        SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center      in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for      teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current      and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and      technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom      activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a      number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA      Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it      does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments      for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered      electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by      mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during      missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop      between the user and NASA.        SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs      useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images      from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.        You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8      bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov      (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the      Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.        Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in      directory SPACELINK.          NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)        The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for      NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.      Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and      log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending      email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.        You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,      no parity, one stop).

The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent      all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long.      Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00      while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII      along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate      ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of      $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue      alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for      $300.00.        Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic      media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion      non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may      not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more      expensive than those given.

There is the possibility that there is some degree of constipation causing  chronic straining which has caused the bowel movements.  The classic   problems that are supposed to be looked for in someone with a hernia are  constipation, chronic cough, colon cancer (and you're not too young for  that) and sitting for long periods of time at the computer, reading news.

2,"  While in grad school, I remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with  ""heat shock proteins"". Apparently, burning protein will induce changes in he  DNA. Whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion  I don't know, but I never eat burnt food because of this.     Also, many woods contain toxins. As they are burnt, it would seem logical that  some may volatilise, and get into the BBQed food. Again, I don't know if these  toxins (antifungal and anti-woodeater compounds) would survive the rather harsh  conditions of the stomach and intestine, and then would they be able to cross  the intestinal mucosa?    Maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself (which is almost  *anyone*... :)) can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that  may be in the wood used to make charcoal and BBQ.

It  makes me proud to be a libertarian.  It appears both conservatives and  liberals prefer to cold war until you win, then nurse the enemy back to  health for another go around.    It's like subsidizing the wealthy countries (Japan, Germany, etc.) with  free defense, and then trade-warring with them because of the economic  competition.  It's like subsidizing tobacco farmers while paying  bureaucrats to pursuade people not to smoke.    I ask myself, what law could we pass to prevent government from doing  stupid, frivilous things with OUR money?  Then I think, the Constitution  was supposed to do that.  Could someone please tell me what legitimate  constitutional power the federal government is using when it takes money  from my paycheck and gives it to needy countries?  Seriously.

This is a   critical point in the history of world and we can make a change otherwise things  will not change there in Bosnia.. Rapes/killings/ethnic cleansing will  go on as a norm in the days to follow. The UN will get to the towns after the fall  of thousands of inocent civilians (like in Zapa just the past weekend!). It happened  to the Jews in 1940's, it's happening to the muslims today and who will be the next  victim??    Since the Europeans want to remain indifferent in this issue, time has come for US to  take a leadership role to stop these crimes against humanity. Time is now and  this is for real folks, the people of New England Bosnian Relief Committee seriously believe  that Clinton's Adminstration will stop supporting the Bosnian cause without sustained  public pressure. I just called Democaratic Sen. John Kerry's office and they are saying that   he (the senator) is waiting for president to take a decision, means that he will wait and   join the band-wagon later if it ever moves!     Please don't rely on others to take part in this demonstration -You as an individual  will make a big difference. Bring your families too, not only you will help a great  cause but also it will be fun for all. I know of several families from Massachusetts  who are travelling friday night to participate there. Contact the local Islamic center  or Bosnia relief agency if you want to travel by pre-arranged busses. The best option   for students is to rent-a-car and car-pool. Please, spread the word around...

MJM>I have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of  MJM>circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.    Digi-key has the NE-622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on  one chip.    For a great combination of theory with actual circuits, the best  reference for non-engineers is probably the Radio Amateur's Handbook  from the ARRL.

0,"         In previous postings by Hellman, Bellovin, etal it was  reported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in  64 bit blocks as is done with DES.  The users key K which can be  derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt  plaintext M and is then used to form a ""three part message"".       This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted  with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part  message is then encrypted by still another key.       My question is: What is a message?       For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized  voice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized  and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block.  This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure  communications link.       Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to  each 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the  session?       If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how  do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does  just that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?  Is a facility clearance required to manufacture?       Any ideas? "

Luckily for us, some  of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws.

Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay  for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don't like  it, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a  floating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.  It's the same   reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.    Pat writes:  George.    	It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry.  If ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include  a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government  here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental  civil rights.    I say:   	Any reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show  	you that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice,  	discrimination, and violence against others of different  	races, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.    Pat says:  If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation  to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected  in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you  know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,  they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent  you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.  In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.    I say:  What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,  would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating  at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and  would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and  aesthetic values that make us human.  This includes the need for wild  and unspoiled things, including the night sky.

I cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic.  Technology is neutral  to good or evil.  When technology is used by ""evil"" men, it is called  evil technology.  When it is used by ""good"" men, it is called good  technology.  Really, it is just technology that allows action to be  realized more efficently and on a larger scale.    > By its very nature,  it  favors  > the  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-  > not).

2,"  Actually I am entering vet school next year, but the question is   relevant for med students too.    Memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.  Since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy,   histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass   memorization -- I am a little concerned.  As I am sure most   med students are.    Can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  I   have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like  thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  But I have  never applied them to large amounts of ""data"".    Has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or  cheap software?       Can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  Being an  older student who returned to school this year, organization (another  one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.    Please no griping about how all you have to do is ""learn"" the material  conceptually.  I have no problem with that, it is one of my strong   points.  But you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is  rote memorization.      Thanks for your help. "

Not because the engineers at BMW are  putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile  environment for electronics, and I would expect the software to be conservative.

Good luck getting at the counter :-).        I wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's  probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.

That's  why they're used.      Actually, I don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a ""sugar pill"".  I don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always  labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the  name.    It's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just  not for what you have.

Apologies to those who've  seen the following before:]    To explain my position on the ""War On Drugs,"" I offer this:    Drugs And Crime: A New Approach    by Ken Barnes      Given that:    1. The trade in illegal drugs is responsible for   much of the crime which afflicts our nation.    2. People who want drugs (particularly people who   are predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get   them, whether or not they are legally available.    3. Despite current law enforcement efforts, drugs   are readily available to those who want them.    4. Addiction to drugs, both legal and illegal, is   responsible for a significant drain on the productive   resources of our country, and this occurs in a variety   of ways, from the cocaine-addicted babies who are   unable to learn, to the spread of disease among   addicts, to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse   and tobacco smoking.    5. A general economic principle of government is   that whatever is subsidized you get more of, and   whatever is taxed you get less of.  To be most   effective in confronting the nation's drug problem,   some way must be found to utilize these additional   powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use   less attractive.    While this country's current efforts to combat   legal drugs have succeeded in some respects, (there is   a greater awareness of the health consequences of   smoking, and designated-driver programs have helped   reduce drunk driving, for example), the same cannot be   said for the ""war"" on illegal drugs.  There remains a   core group of illegal drug users which support   international networks of smugglers, pushers, growers,   processors, kingpins, and gangsters.  These networks   and their ""marketing activities,"" which include drive-  by shootings, corrupting law enforcement authorities,   and smuggling weapons, are directly or indirectly   responsible for a large proportion of the crimes   committed in our country every day.    Clearly, illegal drugs and rising crime are   linked.  It takes only a moment's reflection to   recognize how they are linked.  The link is money.  As   with this country's failed effort to prohibit alcohol   consumption, a black market has been created, in which   greedy local monopolies, like the gangsters of a   bygone era, have profited enormously from their   illegal trade.  The victims of this trade include not   only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be   caught in the crossfire, but, I would argue, the drug   users themselves.    Were it not for the black market, and the violent   monopoly of the drug lords, drug users might not be   the thieves, robbers, prostitutes and murderers they   have become in order to pay the high prices the drug   lords demand.  In the absence of the drug lords, most    would be, I believe, simply people with a problem,   either a moral problem_or_a medical problem, but_not_a   criminal problem.    Let me be clear however, I am_not_advocating that   we let the criminals who have been preying on our   society for these many years of Prohibition off the   hook.  On the contrary, the new approach I advocate is   one which would not result in either the government or   private industry getting into the business of   promoting crack cocaine, or any other presently   illegal drug for that matter.  Neither is it an   approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over   more and more of their freedom and privacy in an   effort to track down illegal drug users, until ""the   land of the free and the home of the brave"" looks like   a police state.    Here then is my proposal:    1. Possession and use of all presently illegal   drugs is decriminalized, but buying and selling them   remains illegal.  'Potheads' can grow their own   marijuana (as many already do today), other drug users   can legally import their poison of choice as long as   they pay the tariffs, and a barter economy of drug   experimenters develops.    2. Because of the barter economy which supplies   the drug users, the black market profits that have so   enriched the drug lords dwindle.  If these drugs can   be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing, why buy   them?  Nevertheless, there will be those who will seek   to sell these ""noncommercial"" drugs even at relatively   low prices.  Therefore,    3. Law enforcement activity is concentrated on   those individuals who continue to buy and sell, and   also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to   afford even low prices.  But here is where the   strategy begins to differentiate between the drug   dealers, the victimizers, and the drug users, their   victims.    4. Upon arrest for_any_crime,_suspects are   permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a   drug test.  Those who choose to cooperate are informed   that upon conviction for the crime they are accused   of, if they are found to be a drug user, they will be   institutionalized until they are clean, and only then   will they begin to serve their sentence.  If they   choose to cooperate and are already drug-free, they   can begin to serve their sentence right away.  Those   who choose not to undergo the drug test and are   convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer   sentences.    5. Institutionalization of drug using criminals   serves several purposes:    Drug using criminals (and this includes drunk   and/or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their   sources of supply, thus reducing the total number of   drug users in society at large, and consequently   decreasing the demand for drugs on the street, putting   more of the remaining drug dealers out of business.    Institutionalization provides an incentive for   drug using criminals to straighten themselves out,   before becoming part of the general prison population.    While helping protect society from crime,   institutionalization could also serve to deter drug   users from becoming criminals, since drug using   criminals, unlike other criminals, would be delayed   prior to serving their sentences by the additional   time it takes for them to sober up.    Institutionalization of drug using criminals   separate from the general prison population would also   provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could   volunteer for research studies of new techniques and   treatments for addictive disease, with the potential   to benefit both themselves and others.    6. Dealers in illegal drugs are generally not   drug users themselves, and this is particularly true   of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit   organizations.  Under this proposal, dealers would be   more readily identifiable, since upon arrest they   would presumably pass the drug test, or else decline   to take it in order to avoid having to explain why   they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent   they do not use them.  Declining to take the test,   they would of course face stiffer penalties.  While   each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug   would have to stand on own its merits, the outcome of   a suspect's drug test could provide additional   evidence for the prosecution.    7. Just as cigarette taxes have contributed to   the decline of smoking in our country by making   cigarettes more costly while at the same time   providing revenue for anti-smoking campaigns,   noncommercial drugs should be taxed, and the money   generated should be used to combat their use.    Enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis   however, and should not be used as an excuse to   infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial   drug users, since to do so would have the effect of   reintroducing Prohibition.    Instead, drug users will be encouraged to pay the   tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever   found in their possession during the course of routine   police operations, they will be required to pay the   tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to   be destroyed.  If drug dealers are found to be selling   noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid,   they will face additional prosecution for evading the   tax.  The strategy of adding tax evasion to drug   dealing charges is already in use in some   jurisdictions, but its effectiveness is currently   limited by the illegality of drug possession.    Revenue from drug possession taxes and import   tariffs would be used to fund anti-drug advertising   campaigns, and provide support to private sector drug   treatment programs for those unable to afford   treatment.    8. Taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must   be ended.  Federal support of tobacco farming is both   immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets, and   the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands   in many states must likewise be eliminated.    While my proposal would have the effect of   permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs, it   would hold the users of all drugs responsible for   their actions, and I believe, would reduce the harm   drugs have on our society, particularly the crime   caused by the illegal drug trade.  So long as we   remain a free nation, with relatively porous borders,   and freedom for our citizens to travel, we will always   have a drug problem.  Whether it takes the form of   heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings, drunk   drivers killing and maiming others on our streets, or   emphysema patients struggling for breath after a   lifetime of smoking, the results are the same:   needless suffering and death.  As a society we must   recognize that while our society permits us to harm   ourselves with drugs, as we are already doing   (regardless of the drug laws), we must take a stand   against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to   others.  We must particularly oppose the vicious and   violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug   users.  By taking the profits out of their deadly   trade, my proposal goes a long way towards shutting   down these powerful criminal organizations.    The question of whether drug use is a moral or   medical problem depends on which group of drug users   you're talking about.  Different drugs have different   effects, and some are more addictive than others.  The   addictiveness of a drug also often varies between   individuals, and so we have some people who can drink   alcohol in moderation, while others find they cannot   resist the bottle.  Nicotine, which former Surgeon   General C. Everett Koop declared to be as addicting as   heroin, is a legal drug with known harmful effects,   and while some people can stop smoking by willpower   alone, others continue to smoke even after treatment   for lung cancer.    For those individuals who can stop taking drugs   on their own, we may argue that because they have   chosen to use them, this represents a moral failure on   their part, or an unwillingness to face the   difficulties of life.  But for the addicts, while they   may have chosen to use drugs the first time, by the   time they discover their addiction it is too late.  We   cannot hold them responsible for their disease, any   more than we would blame someone who is drowning for   an inability to swim.  Perhaps they should have known   not to go near the water, or perhaps someone should   have warned them of the danger, but in their present   circumstances warnings will not help.  Neither does it   help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing   them weights.       --Standard disclaimer--   *.x,*dna**************************************************************  *(==) Ken Barnes, LifeSci Bldg.      * Conservative libertarians     *  * \'  KEBARNES@memstvx1.memst.edu    *      for Pro-Balance!         *  *(-)**Memphis,TN********75320.711@compuserve.com**********************  ""I find television very educating.

Just about the only circumstances   in which I could think that they would be interested in their political   views would be to recruit them as spooks. They can be guaranteed to give  the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the   socialists such as myself who have been persecuted.       Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which  the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force  lets try thinking.    In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as  a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush  was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook   remember.    Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply ""ask"" their  chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be ""nice""  boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the  chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.    Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the  same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know  this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and   Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show   trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed? I have, it was when he said that socialism  and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.

The sad truth is: sometimes that is  good, or at least, better than the alternative.    >But let's ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents.    Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the  number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these  accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.    ...  >But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.   This is not so you  >can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range.    In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that.   The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber  handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,  would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't  why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,  and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to  kill people.    >This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show  >someone  that you have a gun and they go ""Gee, perhaps I should leave"".    In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses  of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer  not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what  you say when you point a gun at them.    If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to  immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is  about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work  the best.[3]    >No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human  >body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most.    Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)  aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of  them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with  having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to  use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,  but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and  knowing how to use the tools to do that.    ""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear  arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in  government.""  	- T. Jefferson.    I think what Jefferson said is still true.    >And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes  >off into the wrong fleshy target.    Not very often compared to other use.[3]    >Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife.    This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is  very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly ""get-pissed"" and kill  someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long  histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these  people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.    >Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to  >kill things.  Right?    Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I  never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from  rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than  is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them  to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,  I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and  ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm  after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,  people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,  particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per   1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been   steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate   of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.

However, with a 32kHz crystal the  lowest current drain I can acheive at 3.7V Vcc is 150uA.  This is  three times the specified MAXIMUM under the conditions I am attempting  to create.    I have done the following things:    1) Made sure that RESET/ is asserted for Trlh after powerup, and AS is     low during this time.      2) Made sure that there is a cycle on AS after the negation of RD/ or     WR/ during which STBY/ was asserted.    What am I doing wrong?    Thanks very much,    Martin. "

The American press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to  refer to both Christians and Jews.  Christian fundementalists are  often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests.

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to  answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What these  people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.    It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful object  oriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on  both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming  approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software  development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is  not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis   capability.    Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great  idea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on  the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation  studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There  are tons of applications, with the ability to create ""virtual"" instruments  that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the  addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station,  allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial  I/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control software  for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.    Dennis, University of Alabama in Huntsville "

EDT  	       	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Good evening and welcome to all of you   in the thousands of communities around the country that are taking   part in this satellite town meeting for the month of April.  	       	     You know, today is April 13th.  In 1743, Thomas   Jefferson was born, 250 years ago.  I think that's appropriate to   mention at the beginning of this meeting because since that time he   has been, of course, a person who has been one that we've all   followed in terms of our democracy and the importance of education   here in this great country.  The success of our democracy according   to Jefferson really depends upon the success of our educational   system.  	       	     His philosophy of government, his belief in the   importance of education is also very meaningful to our special guest   here this evening.  Tonight we're so pleased to have with us   President Clinton.  He's come over from the White House to join us in   the Chamber of Commerce studios.    	       	     Mr. President, it's good to have you.  We thank you for   taking the time to visit with these communities here on the satellite   network and we welcome you here this evening.  	       	     Also we have with us Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.    And, Bob, it's certainly pleasant to have you with us this evening   also.  	       	     I have some questions for our two guests, and I'm sure   many of you do, too.  So please call us if there's something that   you'd like to ask.  The number is 1/800/368-5781 or 5782.  In   Washington, D.C. the number is 202/463-3170 or 3171.  	       	     I believe the President has a few words that he might   want to share with us.  And, Mr. President, I'll ask you to do that   at this time.  It's great to have you.  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  	       	     I'm glad to be here with my friends, Dick Riley and Bob   Reich -- also members of my Cabinet -- at the headquarters of the   Chamber of Commerce to support the effort that the Chamber is making,   along with its Center for Work Force Preparation, to help to examine   tonight the whole critical question of how to move our young people   from school to the work place.  	       	     I want to compliment the Chamber on all their efforts,   recognizing that without an educated work force we can't grow this   economy or remain competitive, and recognizing that we all have to   work together -- business and government, labor and educators -- to   make things happen.  	       	     This satellite town meeting is a good example of that   kind of working together.  And if you'll forgive me a little home   state pride, I want to say a special word of thanks to the Wal-Mart   Corporation, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, for providing   several hundred of the sites for this town meeting tonight.  I   appreciate that a lot, as well as the sites that are provided for all   the rest of you.  	       	     I have tried as hard as I could to move toward   constructive change for this country.  Secretary Riley talked about   this being Thomas Jefferson's 250th birthday.  If Thomas Jefferson   believed in anything, he believed in these three things:  first, in   education; second, in real personal liberty, freedom of religion,   freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of the press; and   third, in the absolute imperative of changing as times change.    	       	     If you go to the Jefferson Memorial here in this   beautiful city, which is now bedecked with all of its wonderful   cherry blossoms, you will see Jefferson saying that we have to change   with changing times.  	       	     For us here in America, that means reducing our deficit   and increasing our investment and putting our people first so that we   can compete in the world.  We're here to talk about that tonight --  about what we can do to educate and train our people better.  Unless   we do that, none of the efforts that all the rest of us make in   government, even to bring the budget into balance, even to increase   our investment in other things which will grow jobs, will last in the   long run.  	       	     We also have to have people who can carry their load.    And in a world where the average young person will change jobs seven   or eight times in a lifetime, that begins with the education system   and continues into the work force where education must go on for a   lifetime.  It's not just important what you know, but what you can   learn.  	       	     And if I might, I'd like to close just by emphasizing   we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership   between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the   private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're   trying to get off to a good start this summer with a program that   would create more than 700,000 new summer jobs, including many   thousands that have a strong education component so our young people   can be learning and working at the same time.  	       	     Dick, I think I ought to stop there.  That's a good   place we can begin, I think, the discussion.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you so much, Mr. President.  	       	     Each month we get together and talk about ways that all   citizens can work towards reaching the national education goals.  And   tonight, we'll focus on goal five, and how communities such as yours   can prepare students for this world of work.  	       	     This week, the Education Department and the Labor   Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called   Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.    The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's   proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched   jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged   areas of the country.    	       	     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it   somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls   for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your   words is that so important?  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.    First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may   have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want   them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to   continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of   research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may   forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year   over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for   schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already   taught before.  	       	     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress,   not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to   abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is   learning because we think that the best and most productive workers   will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience   could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to   succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are   disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go   into the next year, is really even greater.    	       	     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs   throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this   educational component of training.  	       	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr.   Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer   or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with   education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people,   for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning   geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or   working on something, and they can see the exact and direct   application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a   lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between   education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.    It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of   young people even beyond the summer.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.    	       	     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship   program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell   us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it   developing.  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why   it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade   will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will   require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people   get in a high school diploma.    	       	     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries   of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school   education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young   people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not   go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because   they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their   employers.  	       	     So we think America has a big economic interest in   trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school   but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes   two years of further training either in a community college, a   vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in   this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some   funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states   and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in   a way that would be customized essentially by the business community,   based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could   revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and   the earnings of American workers.  	       	     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think   you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the   people watching this program -- that the business community and   educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many   of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In   fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The   people watching this program probably are the ones who are most   directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley   and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes   already out there.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight   about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning    career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal   with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of   these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?  	       	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and   you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much   longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business   community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're   doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The   Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these   kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've   aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.  	       	     The business community is going to be actively engaged   in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and   helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions   develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.  	       	     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is   one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these   players in a community come together and work together and cooperate   together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and   the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody   is talking, but they're not really working together in a common   strategy.  	       	     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick,   would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic   excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a   tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to   make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be   eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year   college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're   talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation   skills for on-the-job learning.  	       	     And again, those are the critical components.  It's   already being done.  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one   point based on my personal experience at home -- the business   community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are   the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught,   but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort   of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are   going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the   second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and   influence them.  So I think that's very important.  	       	     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at   the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some   funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make   sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the   quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to   determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of   course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery   program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about   long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr.   President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the   communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be   coming forth before too long.  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I   were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public   schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that   a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.    	       	     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals   that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President   Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to   do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in   Congress that will actually define the things that the national   government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the   children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those   goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school   ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school   graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are   confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are   second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe,   disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took   them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of   life-long learning in this country.  	       	     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a   state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector   role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to   introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is;   and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job   is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality   that we need to meet.  	       	     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite   like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.    Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their   money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and   partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really   it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms   of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to   support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform   efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.  	       	     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to   the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of   course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and   I wonder if you would comment on that.  	       	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of   our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they   don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system   of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had   national skill standards to which they could aspire and which   employers would understand as a national credential, many of these   young people would actually find that they were much more eligible   for jobs.  	       	     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other   countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to   college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain   technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If   you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to   develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working   with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private   industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the   kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other   institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go   ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce   Todd of Austin, Texas.  	       	     Q	  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and   Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We   have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who   have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me   simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with   much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are   very supportive.    	       	     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our   summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to   have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much   as 3,500 with the federal assistance.    	       	     Much of the question that we had designed you have   answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But   the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day   would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round   is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal   level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-  round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the   local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's   something that we believe is very important to success in this   effort.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to   answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling,   and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.    I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.    	       	     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can   structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer   program and that will move a lot of these young people back into   schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in   the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to   try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs   to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're   working on that.  	       	     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the   Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to   build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job   training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give   heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you   asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we   hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being   trained on a year-round basis.  	       	     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said   a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen   as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people   actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when   they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we   hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and   we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget   cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue   raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be   able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.  	       	     Bob, do you want to say anything?  	       	     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out   of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing,   and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high   school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in   addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of   jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.    It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the   economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything   else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I   think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I   think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or   greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going   to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything   right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000   will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into   next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it   will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working   together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And   then the state, with all the various school districts, a very   important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I   think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that   moving.  	       	     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.    	       	     Doctor?  	       	     Q	  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to   be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school   and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since   its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two   alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages   we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an   extremely effective learning strategy.  	       	     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are   several principles that are very important in bridging the school and   work.  And these include integrating theory in the classroom with   practice in the workplace, with providing all students early exposure   to careers, as well as providing opportunities for them to reflect   upon these experiences while they strengthen their skills; and   lastly, the critical role of the liberal arts, particularly in the   development of high performance competencies.    	       	     My question, then is:  How can the general education   faculty and the academic curriculum be more closely integrated with   transition to work experience?  And what mechanisms and strategies   can you suggest to achieve this integration?  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, thank you very much.  I think --   and we'll get a response from you all on that, and very interesting   work going on there.  We're going to have three people, our next   guests on the program this evening, that will be some specialists     in that area that you're speaking, and I'll certainly pass that on to   them and we can discuss it later.  	       	     You all care to comment -- any comments you might have?  	       	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'd just like to say, if I might, one   thing.  I want to reemphasize this and I don't think I'm being as   clear about it as I'd like, although I think at least one of the   people who will be on the second panel will be able to say it more   explicitly than I.  I think this whole concept of applied academics   is very important.  And I think that we have to basically abolish   what I consider to be a very artificial distinction between what is   vocational learning and what is academic learning.  	       	     I think we should keep the liberal arts going.  I think   we should have a strong component for people who are in the   vocational program.  	       	     SECRETARY REICH:  It seems to me that we also need to   rethink our entire tracking system, because a lot of these school and   work combinations are important for mainstream students.  They're   important for all students.  It's not just a special group of   students that needs them.  	       	     Some of the experiments that I've seen around the United   States -- Dick, I'm sure you've seen them as well -- are mainstream   experiments.  They're mainstreaming all the students.  At 11th and   12th grades they're giving them a combined work and school experience   and then a transition program.  And again, the kids can either go on   to college if they want; they can go on to technical community; they   can go on to an entirely -- a large variety of possibilities and   career directions.  	       	     But we have to get away from the stigmatizing that often   goes on with young people who simply are doing job-related or work-  related work within the classroom, within our schools.  	       	     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you, very much.  I think that's   going to be the last call that we have time for.  Mr. President, I   think you've got to move on to another matter, and I want to thank   you and Secretary Reich for being here.  We appreciate your time and   your ideas, and it's been a tremendous help to us.                                       END9:00 P.M. EDT       "

This sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in  DES.  Merritt and I pointed out this weakness in Kerberos in a paper  that came out about 2.5 years ago, in both Computer Communications  Review and Usenix.  For that matter, it was loudly discussed on the  Kerberos mailing list even earlier.    The problem has nothing whatsoever to do with DES, and everything to do  with bad password selection.    I'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks  possible on DES.  I'm quite dubious that private research labs know  them.  And the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well  established; see, for example, the Garon and Outerbridge paper in the  July '91 Cryptologia.  You're not going to do it in an hour with only  ``rather powerful DES hardware''.  I'll leave the arithmetic as an  exercise for the reader.  On average, you'll need to do 2^55 trials.  Pick your own parameters for how fast the DES engine runs, and for  how many such engines are used. "

In comparison, in   the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall   decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in   gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of   this disease from 1985 through 1992.        In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department   of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,   reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively   (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics   (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases   with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%   of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by   age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or   equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all   reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the   largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age   group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).        Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver   metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the   state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area   occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods   considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency   syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.        When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among   men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in   the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits   by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases   diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,   the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised   94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among   self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,   respectively).        Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,   university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted   to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea   culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased   23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the   fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).        From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and   Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado   increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,   the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for   whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)   (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from   1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases   increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.     Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE   Hoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD,   Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br,   Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for   Prevention Svcs, CDC.     Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992   may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more   complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH   surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea   cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories   suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.   However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning   laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the   gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.        One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in   Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a   recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs   (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area   coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires   further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated   previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)   -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom   gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,   and gang affiliation.        The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the   national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective   19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for   gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at   greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-  specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as   socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.        In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,   interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting   partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at   increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black   males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in   schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted   primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to   perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational   interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of   members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders   and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety   belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50   states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety   belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by   an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major   cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of   occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for   those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In   addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to   use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between   adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints   for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC   analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System   (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this   study.        Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to   18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,   random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury   Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499   (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent   was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for   that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in   this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than   consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).   Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software   for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates   and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined   by p values of less than 0.05.        Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six   (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no   law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,   and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a   vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse   of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary   enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a   safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states   used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.   The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law   requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law   (no-law states).        Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not   consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and   adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square   test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus   43.2%, respectively).        High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1   year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than   consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported   high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age   (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for   adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-  occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1%   for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of   consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult   safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age   groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).        Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded   that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,   higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with   increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated   with increased adult safety-belt use (8).     Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National   Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.     Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others   indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely   to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these   nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit   other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater   risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).        Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with   child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs   should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low   educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such   programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve   low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are   directed at parents with young children.        Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In   addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,   those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do   not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety   belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and   safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may   increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --   the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the   highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                                 IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                           AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88          Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance   systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.        Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance   in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for   the years 1983-1988.        Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program   and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-  based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The   prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-  1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan   Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,   sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.        Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal   alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the   kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general   diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand   limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are   probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these   defects are relatively easy to diagnose.        Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy   termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,   the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be   related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene   pool, or random variation.        Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several   collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in   the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on   the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89         Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza   virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually   from October through May.        Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance   conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.        Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices   of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO   collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza   viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and   territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians.   Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received   throughout the year.        Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B   viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency   overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted   over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices   of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were   similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of   identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype   increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the   1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were   reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza   A(H1N1).        Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of   influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the   importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since   amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.        Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced   throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make   informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual   surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates   for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons.   Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                     High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies    Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-  ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been   developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),   embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,   these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive   technology (ART) procedures.     Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or   pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility   management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to   proceed with one of the ART procedures.     Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility   service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and   Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in   ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients   in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the   traditional therapies.     The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our   Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the   realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are:     o in vitro   o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube     transfer   o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.   This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed   towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then   subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA   amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.     There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by   other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and   hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ   hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of   which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit   sex-linked disorders.     The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that   it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility   of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth   of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our   Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of   unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and   the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred   to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under   strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being   processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our   andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to   perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically   stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing   hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo   lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs   obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic   egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,   we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our   Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.         Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal   deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male   factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall   success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per   cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173   IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.        Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is   disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological   factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well   recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous   ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle   attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant   of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an   Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of   traditional therapies.        The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not   been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs   available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates   significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;   and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is   unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our   Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may   be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that   fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant   proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,   the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our   program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs   of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.          GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,   usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves   introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian   tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization   occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,   with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for   transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in     HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26  Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993    which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such   pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility   and/or idiopathic infertility.           The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990   indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained   with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36   percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might   expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our   program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while   substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the   patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing   a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing   general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from   obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,   and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.        The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial   environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between   January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT   cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.        Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when   embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.   This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for   success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical   issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated   by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from   both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs   should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.        Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,   is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but   who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in   combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10   percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the   procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under   the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm   through enzymatic digestion.        Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10   percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly   relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.   Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques   for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such   efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology   offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to   establish conception.

In fact, if a speach was not offensive to some, its  protection under Freedom of speach laws would be useless. It is  speach that some find questionable that must be protected, be  it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. It is only  through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can  enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant. That is the  idea behind freedom of expression.  	What you find offensive might be perceived as truth by  some and what they might find offensive might be your belief.

From the limited details released so far, It seems that the clipper chip   system must employ some sort of public key cryptography. Otherwise, the key   management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system   unworkable. It probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place  at the start of each call. Thats how they would identify the private key in   their data base?    This means that either the NSA has developed some non RSA public key   algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize PKP & RSADSI. The former is   rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making  chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard. If the feds  are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that   could break RSA's stranglehold on public key crypto in the U.S.       As for my impressions of the whole scheme It seems that instead of trying to  ban strong crypto, they are trying to co-opt it. Their contention that they   need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key  registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm. More likely  is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont   have the keys registered. Anyone else notice that in their Q&A session, they  talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but  carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed.  They seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without   court order even though tapping a phone line requires one. Also pick up on   their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we'll ban strong crypto outright?  I dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all (legal) ways  possible.

The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for  another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with  major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a  set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.    Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort.

My name is Elias Davidsson, Icelandic citizen, born in Palestine. My  mother was thrown from Germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'  (at that times this group was defined as 'Jews'). She was forced to go  to Palestine due to many  cynical factors. I have meanwhile settled in  Iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from  my homeland, Palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to  the 'indesirables'). These people include my neighbors in Jerusalem  with the children of whom I played as child. Their crime: Theyare  not Jews. My conscience does not accept such injustice, period. My  work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism  and racial discrimination. Those who protest against such practices  in Arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based  on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism  from Israel. The struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.    The Center for Policy Research is a name I gave to those activities  undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command  the support of many volunteers in Iceland. It is however not a formal  institution and works with minimal funds.    Professionally I am music teacher and composer. I have published   several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in Europe.    I would hope that discussion about Israel/Palestine be conducted in  a more civilized manner.

Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely  to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer  fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.    Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used  their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though  they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.    The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The  space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to  temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation  effects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibility  for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure  changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could  lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.    These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal  for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of  success.    -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office        kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368         ""Good ideas are common -- what's uncommon are people who'll        work hard enough to bring them about."" -- Ashleigh Brilliant "
1,"Nntp-Posting-Host: plains.nodak.edu    Just to shed some light on the fire, it was widely reported (AP, etc.) that  there WERE several witnesses to BD folks starting the fires.  It has also  been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once, which  rules out a Bradley knocking over a lamp, etc. as the cause.    What I would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident.  I  believe the moves made were right and proper, but I still have some problems  with some of the tactics.  After watching the ABC special on it tonight, as  well as CNN and Nightline, I question some of the ATF and FBI actions.    1) Could it have been possible to have taken Koresh outside the compound at  some time before the Feb. 28th raid?    2) Could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.    3) Were FBI actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the ""right"" course of action?    And a few other questions.  Like I said, I believe the actions taken, in  general, were proper.  But I still have some reservations.    One other point, I'm no fan of Janet Reno, but I do like the way she had the  ""balls"" to go ahead and take full responsibility.  Seems like the waffle boy  had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue. "

2,"  Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup   several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, ""How to improve your  sight - simple daily drills in relaxation"", by Margaret D. Corbett,   ('Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It   talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been  any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by   actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing   the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the   too-long eyeball?    Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most  logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,  i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been  any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by   changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of   eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the   eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Bates's   idea, right?)    Thanks for any information.     "

Oh great.      Today's headlines tell us that the Croatians and Bosnians are fighting    each other throughout central Bosnia, in battles that the UN describes    as ""out of control"" and atrocities being reported from both sides.    These people are crazy.      Right now the Serbians are Number One in violations of human rights    and general carnage but crazed violence in the Balkans is like the    car-rental business - if you're Number Two you just try harder.      The region doesn't need military aid; it needs psychiatric help!    We should bomb them with Thorazine and then air-drop several     regiments of psychotherapists.      There is no justification for US military involvement because there    is no reasonable, definable goal we can achieve militarily.  Sure,    if send in several divisions of mechanized infantry we can probably    stop the more egregious fighting; but only as long as we are willing    to stay in there and play policeman and get shot at.  The minute we     leave or turn our backs they'll be at each other's throats again.                                      BTW, with Bosnia's large Moslem population, why have nations like     Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and others with either money     or strong military forces not spoken out more forcibly or offered     to help out Bosnia?   The Turkish ambassador has ocassionally said    a thing or two, but that's all; I see no great enthusism from any     of those places to get *their* hands dirty.    Why does the US always    get stuck with this stuff?      Besides, there's no case that can be made for US military involvement    there that doesn't apply equally well to, say, Liberia, Angola, or    (it appears with the Khmer Rouge's new campaign) Cambodia.

Why doing it in such a rough manner? It is much more professional to  steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a  pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. Chances  are that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done  professionally.    > Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate  > with impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from  > key escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.    No, because the Feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations.  True, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say  something like ""The drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'Terminus'""  when the Feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the  speaker is.    No, the criminals will just use some secure encryption. The new  proposal does not stop criminals; it ensures that the government will  be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper.

OK, I see.     Lets not even act as if there is a chance they are human.  See Serdar, when you    judge people because of their race this is called racism.  I tend to frown on    this sort of thing.

I don't understand how the ratio to other accidental  deaths is important.  So guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.  What is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?  I am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a  justification for gun control.  Who needs to be convinced that accidental  gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  I assumed that any humane  person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents  gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.     >>More than anything, gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the  >>community.

If YOU look carefully you will see  that YOU greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.  The CPHV reports that 135,000 youth bring GUNS to school DAILY and that  400,000 bring GUNS to school at least once a year.  The CDC estimates  that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once  in 1990.  The CDC also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key  children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access  to guns in their home.  California schools reported a 200% increase in  student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between  1988 and 1990.  Florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in  schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  These are the ""statistics"".           >>thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the Messiah (Got news  >>for you folks, if the Big Cheese was on this crazy planet of ours  >>presently, he would NOT be carrying a gun or holding children when they  >>were in danger).  >  >""Holding kids?""

0,           Is it realistic for the government to try to keep the details  of the encrytion algorithm secret if it intends to use evidence from  wiretaps in court?

Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years.  The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about  how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and  the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light  shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences,  and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that  the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever  something was wanted, it was smuggled in.         If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced  years before.           Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.

According to U.S. News & World Report, British handgun deaths have  risen over 250% over the past twelve years.  The U.S. number has dropped  5%.           Maybe they're smuggling them across the U.S./U.K. border.  Yeah,  that's the ticket.    >CYA!           Have a nice day, Steve.

If the attack was justified or not is at least debatable. But this is not the  issue. The issue is that you were cheering DEATH. Read again your original  article. You find Israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers, that's  a reasonable (debatable) point, but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is   NOT REASONABLE  by any standards. No matter how you try to justify it.  I may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in S Lebanon.  But no matter what you say, I can not understand your satisfaction for dead  bodies.    I have a question for you. Let's assume a bosnian village, inhabited by serbs  untill a few (10-20) years ago, and later taken over by bosnian muslims (the means  are not very peaceful). Now, do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all (armed)  bosnian muslims ? I would not enjoy, but I would not enjoy ANY dead bodies -   israelis, lebanese or bosnians.      Dorin     "

1,"      It is interesting, sometimes, to listen to U.S. news as seen through  the eyes of another country.......    B.B.C. world news service, on short-wave, originating out of London,  reports that a survivor of the Waco massacre states that a tank, when  making a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosene  lamp and that is how the fire started.  Attempts were made by the  people inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly.    Has anyone in U.S. heard anything similar or are U.S. government  spin-doctors censoring such information?    The B.B.C. news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died  were british citizens.   "

And the 'Armenian Foundation' stole from the   children of Turkiye to fund the criminal activities of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF  terrorists in their cold-blooded murder of defenceless Turkish and  Kurdish people.     THE ARMENIAN FOUNDATION PROVIDED 30 BILLION TL TO ASALA        01/09/92, MILLIYET-- The Armenian Foundation based in  Istanbul is found to have provided 30 billion Turkish Lira ($6  million) to the Armenian terrorist organization ASALA which have  murdered several Turkish diplomats abroad...     Experts on international terrorism assert that the Armenian terrorists  use proceeds from drug trafficking (and from the Armenian Foundation)  to fund their deadly enterprises. The deadliest of terrorist assassins,  Carlos, proclaimed on Spanish television that his organization had  entered into a working relationship with Armenian terrorists and they  are using drug trafficking to raise money 'to continue' to slaughter  innocent people. Now, what is your personal and organizational role   in this scheme?    Recent reports which have been confirmed by the U.S. Administration,   indicate that Armenian terrorist organizations are collaborating with   those who are responsible for the bombing of the United States Marine   barracks in Beirut.

Well, here goes.    The first item of business is to establish the importance space life  sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared  to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested  or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can  make a major change in that lack of insight and education.    All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document  which can be released to the general public around the world.  The  document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long  term human habitation in space.    I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to   succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld  (i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,  chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created  to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.    So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective  methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies  which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed  literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates  and clearly important to existing space programs.    In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into  various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.  This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the  basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,  and any other source!    I'm eager to hear your comments and see posts on this thread. "

PST  	       	       	     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING   on the aid package.    	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The   President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed   yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic   and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.      	     Before taking your questions and running through the   basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.    First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do   with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds   have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is   no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund   any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently   are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin   tomorrow.  	       	     The second point is that this package is designed to   support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package   are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have   been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian   government.  	       	     Third, the President is determined that we will   deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed   to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we   wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we   feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in   front of you.  	       	     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of   trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's   capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend   well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of   governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do   so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make   trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.    	       	     They also agreed that there would be a new joint   commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by   Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister   Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through   the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote   a vastly expanded relationship.  	       	     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down   the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just   give you some general background on what these programs are.    I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.  	       	     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food   and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has   been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian   grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure   there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the   major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food   for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also   be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and   pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.  	       	     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you   know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship   with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia   that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the   Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.    The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are   concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out,   but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on   principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates   thereafter for the life of the deal.  	       	     The third program is a collection of private sector   support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're   going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses   is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.    And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American   enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the   goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in   Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.    	       	     The President has also decided to create a   privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian   government in its priority objective of trying to convert state   enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has   also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a   Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by   prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.  	       	     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary   page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that   this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of   pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total   of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed   tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're   launching.    	       	     The President is also calling for the development of   a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to   try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public   efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in   Russia.  	       	     The fifth program you see is Russian office of   resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and   conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration   project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military   to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic   states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to   make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's   with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American   construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration   basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working   very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say   that we have a long-term commitment to this project.    	       	     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They   are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our   initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the   possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and   gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in   the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much   environmental damage.  	       	     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment,   about the new group being created that the Vice President will   chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing   with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development   committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy,   to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede   trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time   investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this   problem full-time.    	       	     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and   investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an   analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we   just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a   commitment within our own government to have people work on it --   senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly   important.  	       	     You'll notice that the United States is going to   support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer   status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested   our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the   long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is   paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are   supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting   their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.    	       	     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in   credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended   $150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil   project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an   agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion   framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance   Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services.   We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll   get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo   conference, the G-7 conference.  	       	     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to   defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance   objectives with you.  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major   unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts   in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and   secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory   under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.     Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important   agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding   to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130   million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement   program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for   bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.  	       	     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for   the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed   from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially   contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the   construction of that storage facility.    	       	     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help   in the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear   materials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we   add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance   which has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall   safety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety   measures that we have been working out with the Russians over the   last couple of years.    	       	     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more   work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks,   and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last   couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for   safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian   territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of   START I, an agreement to accede to NPT.   	       	     So we are working very hard with all the parties to   the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with   them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia   as a very important step in that process.  	       	     Q	  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in   Kazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with   Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the   same one, why do you feel it's necessary?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same   deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil   field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights   oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced   today.  So it's completely new.  	       	     Q	  Can you tell us more about what's involved?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like   other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do   two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west   Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating   oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.    The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the   natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which   will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what   Russia needs.  	       	     So we think this deal is very, very good development   for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an   American company.  And the American government has played a   leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility   in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.  	       	     Q	  So it's to search and also to renovate fields   that are already there?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.  	       	     Q	  On that point, should other American companies   expect to get administration support for such deals, or should   they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2   billion?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know,   Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the   U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department   and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we   think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th,   there will be $2 billion in financing available for American   companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.  	       	     Q	  That should take up all of the rest of the   deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be   support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a   tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas   companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and   gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will   soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may   even extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.  	       	     Q	  What's the current year budget costs of that   $2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any   current year budget costs --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer   you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.  	       	     Q	  The concessional food sales -- is there any   current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in   which the payments are due?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional   food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.    USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to   expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd   refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.  	       	     Q	  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?  	       	     Q	     and the private sector -- how many folks are   going to be involved in that?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start   with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt   coming into office that there were literally thousands of   organization, private organizations in the United States that in   one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve   democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.    And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that   had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the   administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try   to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give   some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the   efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.  	       	     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will   soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in   the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might   use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of   our own government, but the resources of the American private   sector and schools and communities across the nation.  	       	     Q	     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word   yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated   besides the $300 million the President talked about?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration   is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What   the President has done this weekend is to consult really   intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional   measures the United States could take in some of these areas to   support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he   returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other   ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.  	       	     Q	  Two questions about the $700 billion   agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of   consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.    So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you   explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans   for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit   into that situation?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the   United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains   and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think   between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history   here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through   the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle   to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of   last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on   that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and   therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that   program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and   other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we   could promote American grain sales.    	       	     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've   announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the   Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient   authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked   for a concessional loan program.    	       	     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a   short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but   a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what   this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are   worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of   principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the   life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of   interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we   believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal   for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments   and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this   very important grain relationship, which is important for them,   and it's important for the American farm community.  	       	     Q	  I gather from what you say that this could make   it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC   loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through,   is that right?   	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit   about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing    the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program   because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you   know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around   $640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having   taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American   market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to   respond to a specific request from the Russian government for   major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the   grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there,   we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to   great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with   the Russian government and arrived at this solution.    	       	     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides   them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on   the short-term payments.  	       	     Q	  Where do those funds actually come from?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the   Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's   authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do   not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want   to make that general point again:  Everything in this package,   the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been   allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration   can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very   important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year,   that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be   able to do so.  	       	     Q	  How did you arrive at the figure of $700   million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually   have a range from 0 to --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason   for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us   that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and   harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the   shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the   harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the   same level of food imports from the West.  	       	     Q	  I would imagine there's going to be some   considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other   republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.    Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for   the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with   some of the other republics?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very   conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending   American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet   Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the   area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that   you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and   roughly 50 percent to the other countries.   	       	     In the area of food sales, we have been active with   Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We   will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this   summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the   other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are   productive and they're hard-hitting.  	       	     Q	  Has anything happened at the summit to lead   American energy companies and other companies to believe that   Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of   taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our   primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not   only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd   like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're   convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to   support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of   Western governments have the financial resources over the next   decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private   sector can do that.    	       	     We look at our own society and we see tremendous   capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very   good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial   investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new   technology and new capital to finance new production.    	       	     That's what the Russian government has told us it   wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis   on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on   the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently   last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President   Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong   signal to the American business community that we support their   efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-  Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to   support them.  	       	     Q	  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to   deliver on making Russia a more --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I   would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr.   Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas   sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice   President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the   barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil   and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that   committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to   the work.  	       	     Q	  What type of mechanism is already in place to   administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will   the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of   the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the   Russian government for distribution at their will?  	     	      	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking   about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the   program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working   through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure   that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to   the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the   Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can   account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of   months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of   these programs.  	       	     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in   the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it   is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of   the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working   through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the   housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers,   we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the   democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian   private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with   journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have   noticed.  	       	     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different   activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be   carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the   Russian government, some with Russian citizens.  	       	     Q	  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and   on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the   President has to do on that?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George   noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in   the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's   fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we   return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and   we'll get back to the Russian government.  	       	     Q	  You were not prepared for these questions when   you got here?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared   for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not   prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --  let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require   consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with   the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those   concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before   we take any action.  	       	     Q	  Is this package designed so that you will not   have to go to Congress for anything at this point?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the   beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all   the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.    So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to   seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In   effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the   agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And   that's the advantage of this particular initiative.  	       	     Q	  If this, as the President says, is a long-term,   long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment   heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to   Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are   prepared to go to Congress for various things?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been   clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with   President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American   funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a   major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by   Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that   delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.    And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where   it stands now.  	       	     Q	  We've been told repeatedly that a number of   these items represent different or new ways of spending the money   already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these   items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways   that it was not previously set to be?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've   said that these are all projects that either Congress had   allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were   some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this   administration took office and had some new ideas about how the   funds might be expended.  	       	     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or   the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --  Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to   further our programs.  	       	     And example of that is the Food for Progress   concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of   funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we   looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American   market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we   found it.  	       	     Q	  Where, for example, are you getting the money   for this Russian officer resettlement --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the   Freedom Support Act funds.  	       	     Q	  In other words, all of the money is being   directly spent in new ways, so to speak --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant   projects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the   second chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if   you look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that   total $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act   funding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year   '92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the   legislative history of those funds.  	       	     Q	     cooperation --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I   don't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.  	       	     Q	  Could you tell us please, has anything happened   here this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and   Russia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's   happened here --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents,   President Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this   issue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security   and arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's   session.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly   reinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been   talking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple   of weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the   discussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very   important negotiation that's been going on essentially between   Moscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially   discussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute   to this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.    	       	     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend,   I don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.  	       	     Q?	    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is   any of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current   year appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been   earmarked and put it into this fund?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and   mirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We   could have given you a page of assistance numbers that included   out-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to   many of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the   privatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already   talked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.    	       	     We could have put in really big numbers and this   could have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:    This package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're   going to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President   feels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy   that the western governments, the combination of governments, put   up large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not   able to meet them, we're determined, and the President is   determined, to carry out every single program in this package.    And we'll do it.    	       	     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's   part of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking   for Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively   support reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment   on some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.  	       	     Q	     taken it way from any --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.    Okay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds;   so have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in   Russia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.  	       	     Q	  In terms of funding, there is no available   monies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money   somewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I   don't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the   example is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit   guarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay   back within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt   problem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we   looked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement   for grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and   also meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers   have a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply   look for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative   authority to do it.  This program has been successful in other   areas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union,   but we thought we should now.  	     	    	     Q	  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package   for Russia, since these funds were really first derived by   initiatives put forward by President Bush?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think   that's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were   appropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This   administration took office and inherited some obligations that   the Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven   week review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments   that had been made by the previous administration.    	       	     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the   enterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not   been filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to   it.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them   into a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say,   is another Clinton initiative.    	       	     Further, we listened to the Russian government and   listened to the Russian military who told us that the   resettlement of their officers was important to them for   political and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton   has responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment   that beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out   a way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.    	       	     I would also say that the President has given   impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly   about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we   have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends   itself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the   creation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative,   we're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private   sector as well as the American government, to achieve that   objective.    	       	     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And   as most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the   last administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last   administration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton   assistance package for Russia.  	       	     Q	  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the   past has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this   outside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money   will not just disappear because it's being administered by the   Russian government?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I   know that the President and other senior officials of our   government are concerned that American money be spent wisely and   that it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's   intended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the   State Department will take great care in making sure that the   funds are expended properly and that they're reaching their   source.  	       	     I would not that this package is not simply a   package of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of   these projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are   going to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals,   with businesses.  The private enterprise support is another   example of that.  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add   a word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one   area that we've been looking at very, very closely is   consideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting   for these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely,   of course, with the American firms, who would be the prime   contractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of   a imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that   funding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in   Russia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent   efficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.  	       	     Q	  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly   when do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President   is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think   it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over   the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties   on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over   the last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach   out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us   to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said   that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate   in a much more effective way the activities of our own   government.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in   Russia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw   them together and to focus their efforts.  	       	     Q	  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will   actually be spent in the United States by American made goods?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any   figures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something   up in the next couple of days on that.  	       	     Q	  This figure is larger than the figure that has   been in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result   of the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --  unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and   I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put   us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was   briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the   intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of   the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we   had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have   been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week   going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in   Washington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.    And so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been   together for about two weeks.  	       	     Q	  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There   was so much talk before about the President wanted to get   Yeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.    Is that in the out years?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.    President Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance,   that support for the creation of private businesses is important   to him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is   important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize   the state industries is important to them.    	       	     And so what we did was to try to make those the   centerpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We   listened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been   working with the Russian government for months on this trying to   work out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of   these programs was involved every step of the way.    	       	     But let me get at the other part of your question.    The President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader   set of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking   for his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the   table -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in   housing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to   consult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other   allied governments that are also active.  	       	     Q	  There's essentially nothing that happened in   the last day and a half that measurably altered the package that   you came in with?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular   package, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks   ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on   the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've   primarily talked about future, about what more the United States   and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia,   which is our base objective here.  	       	     Q	  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated   to train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me   what about job training for workers who are displaced by   privatization?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we   have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and   financial services in the United States.  Part of the housing   initiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain   Russian officers who are retiring into other professions.  	       	     Q	     money for job training for workers whose   jobs are disappearing because of privatization --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet   allocated any money for that.  	       	     Q	  Why not?  	       	     Q	     of the $6 million is going to build 450   housing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the   Western dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do   housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework   of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've   got to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think   about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also   retraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming   out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.    We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers   as well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian   government.  	       	     Q	     of the $6 million will go to retrain --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.  	       	     Q	  Are you talking about apartment buildings or   single --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about   single, individual dwellings.  	       	     Q	  You're saying that only 450 families will be   served by this?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I   thought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.    What we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the   Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building   housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with   a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next   couple of months and try to figure out with American   organizations in the private sector the best way to get this job   done.    	       	     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.    And so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into   this in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to   spend the money wisely.  	       	     Q	  What is it about this program that convinces   you that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be   in a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back,   especially considering their other debt problem?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think   it's important to note that the United States on its own does not   have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.    It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to   our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what   the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We   can simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do   so, which is consistent with our national interests.  	       	     Q	  Did the President say that the value of the   U.S. contribution was that it would create security and   prosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this   program that does this?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to   go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia,   and that is we want to do everything we can to support the   continuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay   in power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear   forces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction,   which are the three benefits to the United States from reform in   Russia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that   this program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we   have to make a long-term commitment to it.  	       	     Q	  And then on the question of Russia's ability to   repay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15   years from now?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian   government has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping   is that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve   their oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency   revenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years   from now to pay back those loans.  	       	     Q	     substantial government-to-government loan   we've ever gotten into with the Russians?  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to   answer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years   on this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because   the previous way that we financed grain exports was really to   just ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of   effort.  	       	     Q	     government loans in any other sector that   you recall?  I know it wasn't done in --  	       	     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair   to say this is a new and unique effort.                                   END10:25 A.M. PDT "

""I have been closely following for two weeks the withdrawal of Russians and   Armenians from Turkish territories through Armenia. Although two months   have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I   have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at    almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from   Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly   slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to   save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful   events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then   taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people    well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these   places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.   They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the   Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality   problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers   who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and   Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the    Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.    I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is    destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are    speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as    well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is    proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.""

If Irgun had to attack civilian  targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some  objective, I'm sure they would have done so.  I also don't  exclude Irgun's action against British soldiers as terrorism.  The British were showing signs of favoring a compromise with  regards to Palestine, and the Irgun and branch off groups made  a point to kill young British recruits so that mothers and  fathers back in Britain would get angry at Britains continued  presence in Palestine.  Sounds like a form of terrorism to me,  and not much removed from Arab terrorism.  We must not also  forget that Irgun, or Irgun branch off groups [more likely]  killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or  who cooperated with the British.    	I'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but  I'll favor the underdog in this case because I do think they  were a bit screwed. "

Try not to take it so personally.    Look, people with a last Chen don't necessarily own a Chinese restaurant.  I am not interested if you enjoy Chinese food or not. Exploiting my last  name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt.    What I am interested in is the truth. Let me give you an excert from  a recent FDA hearing:               ``There is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect  on the brain,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman of Massachusetts Institute  of Technology. The anecdotal experiences of individuals is  ``superstition, not science,'' he said. ``I don't think glutamate  has made them sick.''    And Dr. Robert Kenney of George Washington University conducted an double  blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to MSG also  had similar reaction when they thought they had MSG but actually not.    Although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group,  some of them might have been due to other causes. But because the anti MSG  emotion runs so high, that some blame it for anything and everything.     My purpose is to present a balance view on the issue, although I am probably  20-1 outnumbered.

At that time there were no radar  detector Detectors!  I am not sure of the impact but I would  imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a  radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!    As I said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the VA law  against radar detectors has been in vain.  In fact, effective  Jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector  accessable to the driver of a vehicle in VA is now $250.00.      I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2  meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector  scream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the  brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)    ==============================================================================  Randy T.

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in  any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference  power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which  should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms  in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted  notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of  the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*  (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted  reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.  So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation  such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.    For power:      dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )    For amplitude      dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )    'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base  10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.  It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for  the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation  convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.    Common references for audio are:    	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms  	0 dBV = 1 volt    	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)  	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)      Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using  the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all  done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application  or moment.    Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear  impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the  power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done  with the above two identities and ohm's law.    --   --------------------------------------------------------------------         Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)      SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)      Intergraph Corp.

0,"Nntp-Posting-Host: snarfblatt.ch.apollo.hp.com  Organization: Hewlett Packard    Read this through once or twice.  Then replace ""prince"" with  ""government"" or ""president"", as appropriate, and read it again.      [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated by  Daniel Donno.]    	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes have  disarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within the  cities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities against  themselves; others have sought to win the approval of those they  initially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others have  destroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definite  judgements on all of these measures without considering the particular  circumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shall  nevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itself  will allow.    	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new prince  disarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, he  proceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make their  arms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,  while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects they  are transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,  nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed by  extending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment of  the two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, while  the former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added duties  and dangers should receive advantages.      	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, by  showing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, you  distrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.  Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you would  have to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already been  discussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never be  good enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtful  subjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquired  state has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history is  full of examples proving that this is so.    	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which he  annexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm all  the subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquire  it; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to render  soft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms of  the entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native to  his original domain.    	...    	And since the subject demands it, I will not fail to remind  any prince who has acquired a new state by the aid of its inhabitants  that he soundly consider what induced them to assist him; if the  reason is not natural affection for him, but rather dissatisfaction  with the former government, he will find it extremely difficult to  keep them friendly, for it will be impossible to please them.  If he  will carefully think the matter through in the light of examples drawn  from ancient and modern affairs, he will understand why it is much  easier to win the favor of those who were happy with their former  government, and hence were his enemies, than to keep the favor of  those who, out of dissatisfaction with the former rule, helped him to  replace it.

1,"  From: baba@Tymnet.com (Duane Hentrich)  -BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic)  -  ---  -d'baba Duane M. Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com  -     I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling  himself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first  in the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term  but may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations  are quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the  eightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar  Max Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the  Nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is  synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who  originally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans  and possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word  by Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is  nontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim  to call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-  shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.      If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In  search of the Indo-Europeans"" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.  The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature  as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and  for Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible  things done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have  no clear claim.

2,"  Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain  chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell,  (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized  example), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location  and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying  external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances  caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will  be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.    Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred  years old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few  tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the  investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some  hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding  the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.    Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. Ideas such as Frankenstein  reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as  when Volta invented the battery.  I personally don't care to revert to supernatural  cause to explain things we don't yet understand. "

When that baby was   crushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited,   would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV   news.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.  Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent   with what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...    : And if the government did start the fire, then why weren't people trying  : to get out of the compound?    Remember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.  Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being  worn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those  on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they  thought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to  put it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and   concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable  of moving.    : And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.    Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the   things that the FBI said (""The BD's started the fire.""  ""The BD's bodies  were found with gunshot wounds."") that are now being refuted by the   evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making  statements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make  them sound like fact.      : I find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe  : a murderous, heavily-armed religious cult, despite much evidence to the  : contrary. Thought Experiment: Suppose this exact same thing happened under  : the Bush administration. What would your answer be then? Would you still  : prefer to believe the cultists?    Yes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop  string of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations  on numerous occasions.    And as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until  they were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If  the BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be  dead today?      : (No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)    : >But then  : >again, that is how Mr. Clinton was elected, by people who believe that  : >his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.    : Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?    Yes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now  if we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of  apologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected  accountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would  happen as often as they do.    : So is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty  : people? Are they, like, just plain evil, or what? Did they just wake up  : one day, stretch and yawn, and throw a dart at a map of the United States  : to figure out who to oppress that day? I'm eager to know.    Acutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of  this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.    Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after  the initial raid on the BD's.  ""Coincidence?  I think not!""    And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over  walls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince  the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by  the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to   a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the  building.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to   cover its ass.      : And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? How is he  : on diabolical laughter?

Worse, you seem to accept without question what the  government says is wrong to be wrong.    David Koresh's religion was not mine but then again, neither are the baptists,  methodists, catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions.  BUT  even though Koresh's, the Baptists, the methodists, etc, don't believe  the same way I do, I recognize that their religions are equally valid  to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st Amendment.  You see, I'm not that much different than Koresh and I suspect many others  fit the same catagory.  I read the Bible many times and as I learned   from it, I discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice  just isn't justified by MY interpretation of the Bible.  Therefore I go  my own way.  So did Koresh.  And neither you nor I nor anyone else,  either individually or collectively as the great socialist ""we"" has ANY   RIGHT WHATSOEVER to tell me or you or Koresh that our religions are wrong.    You seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the Davidians to  just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound  in order to ""save themselves"".  Think (if you're capable) for a moment  about some belief you hold dearest.  Would you abandon that belief if  suddenly told to do so by the government?  If you would do so you are  beneath contempt.  Let's assume you have a belief that you hold dear  enough to commit your life to.  Do you think it would be the correct  course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically  designed to force you to make that ""forsake or die"" decision?    The ""forsake or die"" option is exactly what the government forced on the  Davidians the day the first wave of black-clad stormtroopers fired that  first shot and tossed that first grenade.  The FBI clenched it on Day 51  when they sent in heavy armor against 80-some-odd men, women and  children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms.  The  people who stayed, who held to their beliefs over personal safety, whose  individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit, who  believed that the Bill of Rights meant exactly what it says, to those  people go my deepest respect, regardless of their religion.

I probably could have lived with the insomnia if the  Prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  Maybe  because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a  20mg dose didn't work.

The only problem I'm  having is some minor GI distress, but nothing too annoying.  Hopefully the  Zoloft will work.  Maybe your friend should try this one next.    My psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin  drugs, usually Prozac.  If that works, great.  If it works but has too many  side effects, try Zoloft or maybe Paxil.

The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in   exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an   endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure   of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but   fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have   comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former,   in the long term, unless you have the latter.    One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird   cross between a libertarian and an ""establishment tool"" is that I end up   taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when   the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my   lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.      As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government   to be ""fair"".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed,   whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the   government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.    What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal,   so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong)   sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth   it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its   citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the   major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a   couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it   would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I   agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly   participate if it happens when I'm around.  There is a reason I am such a   strong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.    I've already written off politics.    And yes, this may get me in trouble some day.

2,"NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu    The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly  had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and  commercial space.  This is how it went...        After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,  I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty  Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard  the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.  Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.    We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,  who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not  bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to   make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.    Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking  to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.  We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.    Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another  woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that  we brought up.    But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate  aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.  So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to  LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming   feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.  We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism  paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the  atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog  over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is   more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to   understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education   whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that  they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other  fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday   would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.    We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business  angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal  communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided  in those sectors.    Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..  We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.    We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order  to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.    We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are  proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the  results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),  and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along  the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.    In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data   Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.  He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,  and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually  happen immediatly there.    The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we  knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they  could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know  the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who  really did know the answers.    Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He  said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this  would be something that she would be very interested in, although they  do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the  state 1 week out of 6 these days.    All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.    			John. "

Again, your desire for consistency disappears when it does not suit  your needs.  The principle of protecting life is abandoned based  on ""action versus inaction.""  Not much of a principle.

Hmm, here are a couple:    1) If the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce  pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and  privacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands.    2) Since SkipJack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to  agree on a session key.

2,"  MSG is common in many food we eat, including Chinese (though some oriental  restaurants might put a tad too much in them).  I've noticed that when I  go out and eat in most of the Chinese food restaurants, I will usually get  a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards.  This happens to many  of my friends and relatives too.  And, heh, we eat Chinese food all the  time at home :) (but we don't use MSG when we're cooking for ourselves)    So, when we put one and one together, it can be safely assumed that  MSG may cause some allergic reactions in some people.    Stick with natural things.  MSG doesn't do body any good (and possibly  harms, for that matter).  So, why bother with it?  Taste food as it should  be tasted, and don't cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of MSG.    -michael    --   Michael M. Huang               | Don't believe what your eyes are  telling you.

I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the major  problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion  reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so  small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some  fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would  have to be processed.    This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon  as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't  content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,  average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the  market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.  This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.    On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11  and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...  terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in  titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and  sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are  *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the  world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If  even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2  at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti  basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon  could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the  ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being  mined today).

In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health  insurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like  socialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary  insurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition  has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,  including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,  you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and  be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The  public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount  for a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or  according to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of  French have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health  costs in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other  taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures  for total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure  for the U.S.    That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund  is to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back  in Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health  insurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff  of traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian""  faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that  just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average  Canadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American  counterparts on issues like these).    I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about  leftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian  newsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%  insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know  it, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American  conservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who  seriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the  Americans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans  who spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that  shouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for  insurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that  the Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite  being open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to  spend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a  different culture.    >Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two   >elements of the current health care system that reformers most often   >criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the   >employer-based system of coverage.

Insurance companies, doctors, hospitals and other health   >care providers then bid for the pool's business, competing- in   >theory- on the basis of price and quality.     ""Managed Care"" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western  nations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France  and Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says  of HMO/NHS approaches, ""We left that behind with East Germany!"").  Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling  doctors with budget strings.    In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France  and Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public  hospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions  are different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked  ""sickness funds"" over a century old while Canada divides by their  provinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the  doctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)    With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to  the U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The  French and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations  in more compact geography to improve scales of economy.    gld  --  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Gary L.

What do you think 75% of you is?    But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the  neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water  turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would   also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives  would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear  warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.    As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince  is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in  a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private  ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must  be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe  condition. If any random private citizen could not properly  keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation  is clearly appropriate.    >>  Plus these things have no self-  >>defense purposes.

I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend  themselves and their community. If you look at the American   revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves  from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They  didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for   example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same  old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and  destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.  But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited  for that.    There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The  Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal  weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members  to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers  other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)  a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)  should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a   disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.  The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely  democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only  50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would  be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular  will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the  members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the  form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's  firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not  of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite  different from the general public (at the very least, they  would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and  character of the militia requires that each member provide  a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal  weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.

In fact, be-  fore BATSE, having this widely separated ""Interplanetary Network"" was the  only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot  locate a burst (except to say ""It's somewhere in the field of view."").  With  two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector  to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,  one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these  locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the   sky), voila, you have an error box.    BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,  but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like  to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-  pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.    You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe  (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen  in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be  a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss  neutron star...but this is getting too far afield.    Peter  peterf@oddjob.uchicago.edu   "

1,"  04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANES    By David Ljunggren    MOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weapons  x and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted it  might try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.    Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latest  offensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions in  the Transcaucasian region soaring.    The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of the  Armenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending   planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.    It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey about  the impermissibility of such actions,"" the journalists quoted Duliyan as   saying.    ""If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriate  measures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraft  units.""    Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in the  conflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in which  more than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.    The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane to  Azerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.    A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directly  on a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocket  launchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.    Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troops  and arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from where  they were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.    ""All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by the  country which is affording military assistance over our airspace,"" he said.    Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops   involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.    Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensive  along the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.    ""The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independent  inspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)  leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,"" the agency said.    Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire in  Karabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit of  Commonwealth leaders.    ""The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing the  protection of the Karabakh population,"" Tass quoted him as saying.         At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all have  collapsed.    ""The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to the  legal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" he  said. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not   been recognised by any other country.    Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in future  peace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.    Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister Iskender  Gamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute with  Armenia, had resigned.    Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.  Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant of  Baku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.
