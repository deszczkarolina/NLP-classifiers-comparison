"Dry flowable formulations of Bacillus subtilis strain T429 with fungicidal activity against the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea were synthesized by spray drying. Inert ingredients including wetting agents, dispersants, disintegrants, and adhesives that show good biocompatibility with B. subtilis T429 were obtained. The formulations were optimized by a four-factor and three-level orthogonal experiment. The optimal contents of the wetting agent AEO-5, dispersant NNO, disintegrant (NH4)(2)SO4, and adhesive CMC-Na were 1%, 9%, 5%, and 1% respectively, the filler kaolinite supplemented to 100%. The mixture was suspended in the fermentation broth of T429 at a ratio of 20% (m/v). After being ground in a ball mill for 3 h, the suspension was spray-dried, and the dry flowable formulations were obtained. The formulation showed good physical characteristics, such as high dispersibility and viability. After 12 months of storage at room temperature, it revealed long shelf life and high viability. Field tests in rice crops illustrated that dry flowable formulations at 50 and 75 g/667 m(2) concentrations were as effective as a commercial fungicide in controlling rice blast, control efficiency up to 77.6% and 78.5%, respectively. No significant differences in disease control efficiency were observed between the formulations and the chemical pesticide tricyclazole (79.5%). Overall, a new shelf-stable and effective dry flowable formulation of the biocontrol agent B. subtilis T429 was obtained by spray drying to control rice blast. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",0
"Streptococcus suis is a major bacterial pathogen of young pigs causing worldwide economic problems for the pig industry. S. suis is also an emerging pathogen of humans. Colonization of porcine oropharynx by S. suis is considered to be a high risk factor for invasive disease. In the oropharyngeal cavity, where glucose is rapidly absorbed but dietary alpha-glucans persist, there is a profound effect of carbohydrate availability on the expression of virulence genes. Nineteen predicted or confirmed S. suis virulence genes that promote adhesion to and invasion of epithelial cells were expressed at higher levels when S. suis was supplied with the alpha-glucan starch/pullulan compared to glucose as the single carbon source. Additionally the production of suilysin, a toxin that damages epithelial cells, was increased more than ten-fold when glucose levels were low and S. suis was growing on pullulan. Based on biochemical, bioinformatics and in vitro and in vivo gene expression studies, we developed a biological model that postulates the effect of carbon catabolite repression on expression of virulence genes in the mucosa, organs and blood. This research increases our understanding of S. suis virulence mechanisms and has important implications for the design of future control strategies including the development of anti-infective strategies by modulating animal feed composition.",0
"We first determined the analytical specificity and ubiquity (i.e., the ability to detect all or most strains) of a Clostridium perfringens-specific real-time PCR (rtPCR) assay based on the cpa gene (cpa rtPCR) by using a bacterial strain panel composed of C. perfringens and non-C. perfringens Clostridium strains. All non-C. perfringens Clostridium strains tested negative, whereas all C. perfringens strains tested positive with the cpa rtPCR, for an analytical specificity and ubiquity of 100%. The cpa rtPCR assay was then used to confirm the identity of 116 putative C. perfringens isolates recovered after filtration of water samples and culture on mCP agar. Colonies presenting discordant results between the phenotype on mCP agar and cpa rtPCR were identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA and cpa genes. Four mCP(-)/rtPCR(+) colonies were identified as C. perfringens, whereas 3 mCP(+)/rtPCR(-) colonies were identified as non-C. perfringens. The cpa rtPCR was negative with all 51 non-C. perfringens strains and positive with 64 of 65 C. perfringens strains. Finally, we compared mCP agar and a CRENAME (concentration and recovery of microbial particles, extraction of nucleic acids, and molecular enrichment) procedure plus cpa rtPCR (CRENAME + cpa rtPCR) for their abilities to detect C. perfringens spores in drinking water. CRENAME + cpa rtPCR detected as few as one C. perfringens CFU per 100 ml of drinking water sample in less than 5 h, whereas mCP agar took at least 25 h to deliver results. CRENAME + cpa rtPCR also allows the simultaneous and sensitive detection of Escherichia coli and C. perfringens from the same potable water sample. In itself, it could be used to assess the public health risk posed by drinking water potentially contaminated with pathogens more resistant to disinfection.",0
"The compatible solute glycine betaine is a powerful osmostress protectant, but many microorganisms can also use it as a nutrient. K. J. Hampel et al. (J. Bacteriol. 196:7-15, 2014) defined a regulon in the notorious pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa that comprises modules for the harvest and import of the glycine betaine biosynthetic precursor choline and its subsequent catabolism to pyruvate. The reported data link the GbdR activator with the metabolism of host-derived compounds (e.g., phosphocholine) and virulence traits of P. aeruginosa.",0
"Subcellular organization of the bacterial nucleoid and spatiotemporal dynamics of DNA replication and segregation have been studied intensively, but the functional link between these processes remains poorly understood. Here we use quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy for single-cell analysis of chromosome organization and DNA replisome dynamics in Mycobacterium smegmatis. We report that DNA replication takes place near midcell, where, following assembly of the replisome on the replication origin, the left and right replication forks colocalize throughout the replication cycle. From its initial position near the cell pole, a fluorescently tagged chromosomal locus (attB, 245 degrees from the origin) moves rapidly to the replisome complex just before it is replicated. The newly duplicated attB loci then segregate to mirror-symmetric positions relative to midcell. Genetic ablation of ParB, a component of the ParABS chromosome segregation system, causes marked defects in chromosome organization, condensation, and segregation. ParB deficiency also results in mislocalization of the DNA replication machinery and SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) protein. These observations suggest that ParB and SMC play important and overlapping roles in chromosome organization and replisome dynamics in mycobacteria. IMPORTANCE We studied the spatiotemporal organization of the chromosome and DNA replication machinery in Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fast-growing relative of the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We show that genetic ablation of the DNA-binding proteins ParB and SMC disturbs the organization of the chromosome and causes a severe defect in subcellular localization and movement of the DNA replication complexes. These observations suggest that ParB and SMC provide a functional link between chromosome organization and DNA replication dynamics. This work also reveals important differences in the biological roles of the ParABS and SMC systems in mycobacteria versus better-characterized model organisms, such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.",0
"The Gram-positive, spore-forming pathogen Clostridium difficile is the leading definable cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea worldwide. C. difficile infections are difficult to treat because of their frequent recurrence, which can cause life-threatening complications such as pseudomembranous colitis. The spores of C. difficile are responsible for these high rates of recurrence, since they are the major transmissive form of the organism and resistant to antibiotics and many disinfectants. Despite the importance of spores to the pathogenesis of C. difficile, little is known about their composition or formation. Based on studies in Bacillus subtilis and other Clostridium spp., the sigma factors sigma(F), sigma(E), sigma(G), and sigma(K) are predicted to control the transcription of genes required for sporulation, although their specific functions vary depending on the organism. In order to determine the roles of sigma(F), sigma(E), sigma(G), and sigma(K) in regulating C. difficile sporulation, we generated loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding these sporulation sigma factors and performed RNA-Sequencing to identify specific sigma factor-dependent genes. This analysis identified 224 genes whose expression was collectively activated by sporulation sigma factors: 183 were sigma(F)-dependent, 169 were sigma(E)-dependent, 34 were (sigma)G-dependent, and 31 were sigma(K)-dependent. In contrast with B. subtilis, C. difficile sigma(E) was dispensable for sigma(G) activation, sigma(G) was dispensable for sigma(K) activation, and sigma(F) was required for post-translationally activating sigma(G). Collectively, these results provide the first genome-wide transcriptional analysis of genes induced by specific sporulation sigma factors in the Clostridia and highlight that diverse mechanisms regulate sporulation sigma factor activity in the Firmicutes.",0
"An effective intramolecular C-H arylation reaction catalyzed by a bimetallic catalytic system Pd(OAc)(2)/Cul for the synthesis of fluorine -substituted carbazoles from corresponding N-phenyl-2-haloaniline derivatives under ligand free conditions is demonstrated. The established method is effective for both N-phenyl-2-bromoaniline and N-phenyl-2-chloroaniline, and requires the low loading of Pd(OAc)2 (0.5 mol %). A series of new fluorinated carbazoles were synthesized in excellent yields using the protocol (>83%, 19 examples) and were fully characterized by H-1, C-11 and F-19 NMR spectral data, HRMS and elemental analysis. All compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against four bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with resistance to gentamicin) by serial dilution technique. All tested compounds showed antibacterial activity against three test strains (S. aureus, B. subtilis and MRSA), and most of these compounds displayed pronounced antimicrobial activities against these three strains with low MIC values ranging from 0.39 to 6.25 mu g/mL. Among them, compounds 7 and 14 exhibited potent inhibitory activity better than reference drugs meropenem and streptomycin. Three compounds (2, 4 and 5) showed antibacterial activity against E. coli. with MIC values from 12.5 to 25 mu g/mL. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Fusobacterium nucleatum acts as an intermediate between early and late colonizers in the oral cavity. In this study, we showed that F.nucleatum subsp. polymorphum can bind to a salivary component with a molecular weight of approximately 110kDa and identified the protein and another major factor of 55kDa, as salivary -amylase by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and immuno-reactions. Salivary -amylase is present in both monomeric and dimeric forms and we found that formation of the dimer depends on copper ions. The F.nucleatum adhered to both monomeric and dimeric salivary -amylases, but the numbers of bacteria bound to the dimeric form were more than those bound to the monomeric form. The degree of adherence of F.nucleatum to four -amylases from different sources was almost the same, however its binding to -amylase was considerably decreased. Among four -amylase inhibitors tested, acarbose and type 1 and 3 inhibitors derived from wheat flour showed significant activity against the adhesion of F.nucleatum to monomeric and dimeric amylases, however voglibose had little effect. Moreover F.nucleatum cells inhibited the enzymatic activity of salivary -amylase in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that F.nucleatum plays more important and positive role as an early colonizer for maturation of oral microbial colonization.",0
"The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected animals was investigated. Demodex bovis and D. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. The mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. Pathogenic bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A)) and opportunistic organisms ( Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and Moraxella bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. Pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of Demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. The ""high-turnover"" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that Demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.",0
"Probiotics are live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. The main probiotic bacteria are strains belonging to the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, although other representatives, such as Bacillus or Escherichia coli strains, have also been used. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are two common inhabitants of the human intestinal microbiota. Also, some species are used in food fermentation processes as starters, or as adjunct cultures in the food industry. With some exceptions, antibiotic resistance in these beneficial microbes does not constitute a safety concern in itself, when mutations or intrinsic resistance mechanisms are responsible for the resistance phenotype. In fact, some probiotic strains with intrinsic antibiotic resistance could be useful for restoring the gut microbiota after antibiotic treatment. However, specific antibiotic resistance determinants carried on mobile genetic elements, such as tetracycline resistance genes, are often detected in the typical probiotic genera, and constitute a reservoir of resistance for potential food or gut pathogens, thus representing a serious safety issue.",0
"The insect cuticle is non-cellular matrix secreted from a monolayer of epidermal cells. After abrasion of the larval cuticle of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, a protein with molecular mass of 135 kDa is newly detected in the cuticle. Mass spectrometric analysis of the tryptic fragments from this protein revealed that the 135-kDa protein is encoded by the Cb10 gene. In the predicted amino acid sequence of Cb10, three repeated motifs with [YxGGFGGppG(L/V)L] sequence are found in the C-terminal region. In addition to the repeated motifs, Cb10 has seventeen CxxxxC motifs randomly distributed throughout the polypeptide chain and serine rich region at the N-terminal region. The Cb10 gene is strongly expressed in epidermal cells after pupal ecdysis, and its expression in the larval epidermal cells is induced not only by cuticular abrasion, but also by bacterial infection. These expression patterns suggest some specific roles of this protein in pupal cuticle formation and defense reactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"A group of non-ribosomally produced antimicrobial peptides, the tyrocidines from the tyrothricin complex, have potential as antimicrobial agents in both medicine and industry. Previous work by our group illustrated that the more polar tyrocidines rich in Trp residues in their structure were more active toward Gram-positive bacteria, while the more non-polar tyrocidines rich in Phe residues had greater activity toward Plasmodium falciparum, one of the major causative pathogens of malaria in humans. Our group also found that the tyrocidines have pronounced antifungal activity, dictated by the primary sequence of the tyrocidine. By simply manipulating the Phe or Trp concentration in the culture medium of the tyrothricin producer, Bacillus aneurinolyticus ATCC 10068, we were able to modulate the production of subsets of tyrocidines, thereby tailoring the tyrothricin complex to target specific pathogens. We optimized the tailored tyrothricin production using a novel, small-scale, high-throughput deep 96-well plate culturing method followed by analyses of the peptide mixtures using ultra-performance liquid chromatography linked to mass spectrometry. We were able to gradually shift the production profile of the tyrocidines and analogues, as well as the gramicidins between two extremes in terms of peptide subsets and peptide hydrophobicity. This study demonstrated that tyrothricin peptide subsets with targeted activity can be efficiently produced by simple manipulation of the aromatic amino acid profile of the culture medium.",0
"4'-Phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases) catalyze a post-translational modification essential to bacterial cell viability and virulence. We present the discovery and medicinal chemistry optimization of 2-pyridinyl-N-(4-aryl)-piperazine-1-carbothioamides, which exhibit submicromolar inhibition of bacterial Sfp-PPTase with no activity toward the human orthologue. Moreover, compounds within this class possess antibacterial activity in the absence of a rapid cytotoxic response in human cells. An advanced analogue of this series, ML267 (55), was found to attenuate production of an Sfp-PPTase-dependent metabolite when applied to Bacillus subtilis at sublethal doses. Additional testing revealed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and chemical genetic studies implicated efflux as a mechanism for resistance in Escherichia coli. Additionally, we highlight the in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism; and excretion and in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles of compound 55 to further demonstrate the potential utility of this small-molecule inhibitor.",0
"Verticillium wilt is considered the most important disease of cotton in the world, including Iran. Cultural practices and the use of resistant varieties are the most common strategies used to control Verticillium wilt of cotton. These strategies are not always available or effective. In recent years, biological control using fungal and bacterial antagonists, has been applied to control some cotton diseases including damping-off. In this study, we investigated the possibility of biological control of Verticillium wilt of cotton using bacterial antagonists. Suspension of eight bacterial strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus spp. isolated from different rhizospheric soils and plant roots in the Iranian cotton fields, were prepared with a concentration of 10(8) cfu/ml. Ten cotton seeds (cv Varamin) were then coated with each bacterial suspension and were planted in soil pre-inoculated with Verticillium dahliae microsclerotia. The efficacy of bacterial antagonists in reducing wilt disease was evaluated by determination of the disease index in different treatments. The results indicated that most isolates were effective in reducing disease (compared to the untreated control) 90 days after sowing. Isolates B5, B6, B2, B7, and B3 were the most effective, respectively, in reducing wilt index. In contrast, isolates B1, B4, and B8 did not significantly reduce the disease. In general, P. fluorescens isolates were more effective than Bacillus isolates. This study suggests that bacterial antagonists might be potential biological control agents of cotton.",0
"Duckweed (Lemnaceae) is a plant which grows in the sewage surface teeming with rich microbes, and it is proved that duckweed has a protective mechanism against microbes. In order to study the antibacterial mechanism of duckweeds and provide the basis for screening anti-bacterial substances and studying the infection mechanism of plant and animal pathogens or human pathogenic microorganisms, we first extracted using solvents with different polarities four strains of duckweed belonging to Lemna minor L. zh0018, Landoltia punctata zh0224, Spirodela polyrrhiza (L.) Schleid zh0003 and zh0225. The antimicrobial activities of their extracts were compared by Oxford Cup method and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurement. Meanwhile, the contents and the composition of total flavonoids were determined by spectrophotometry combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The results showed that the methanol extracts and 95% ethanol extracts of the duckweed had different degrees of antimicrobial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium. The antimicrobial activity of the methanol extracts from S. polyrrhiza was the strongest (MIC: 6.25 mg/mL), followed by L. minor L. extracts; die ethyl acetate phase had the strongest activity (MIC: 0.78 mg/mL) followed by the n-butanol phase. The methanol extracts of L. minor L. had the highest level of total flavonoids content, 9.8% of the total extracts, followed by the 8.1% content of the methanol extracts of L. punctata. In addition, the ethyl acetate phase of S. polyrrhiza zh0225 methanol extracts had the highest content of total flavonoids (22.46%) followed by the 17.2% content of the n-butanol extracts. In HPLC measurement, the composition of flavonoids showed tremendous difference among the duckweed extracts, with the two strains of S. polyrrhiza having similar composition with different contents. The results suggested an enormous potential of S. polyrrhiza zh0225 as an excellent duckweed species for active substance extraction and pharmaceutical production.",0
"RNA processing is an essential pathway in the regulation of genetic expression in the cell. In this work, Bacillus subtilis was used to understand the effects of mercury on the mechanism of tRNA metabolism. The CVAAS (cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy) method revealed that from the addition of HgCl2 (0.75 mg ml(-1)) during the bacterial exponential phase, ca. 48% of the added mercury was taken up by the cells. This led to an immediate reduction in the rate of cell division. During this response, we observed accumulation of species shorter than mature tRNA(Cys) over a 10 h period. We did not observe this accumulation for another five tRNAs analyzed. tRNA processing is largely dependent on RNase R and PNPase in B. subtilis. Thus, when the exonuclease PNPase was absent, we found that the shorter tRNA(Cys) species increased and mature tRNA(Cys) decreased after mercury addition, but this proportion changed during the time analyzed. However, in the absence of RNase R and PNPase the accumulation of the shorter tRNA(Cys) was more pronounced and the mature form was not recovered. In the single rnr mutant strain the shorter tRNA(Cys) was not observed. All together, we provide in vivo evidence that PNPase and RNase R are indispensable in controlling tRNA(Cys) quality in the presence of mercury.",0
"In view of the ecological hazards of fungicides, a greenhouse study was conducted to determine the efficiency of seven Bacillus isolates against 32 isolates of Macrophomina phaseolina. Bacillus isolates, M. phaseolina isolates, and their interaction were all highly significant sources of variation in infection (damping-off), plant height, and dry weight. The highly significant (p=0.0000) of Bacillus isolates x M. phaseolina isolates interaction implies that a single isolate of the antagonist can be highly effective against an isolate of M. phaseolina, but may have minimal effects on the other isolates ofM. phaseolina. Therefore, isolates of the antagonist should be tested against as many isolates of M. phaseolina as possible, as this will improve the chance of identifying antagonist isolates effective against several isolates ofM. phaseolina.",0
"As an antimicrobial agent, silver nanoparticles functionalized with both bacitracin A and polymyxin E (AgNPs-BA&PE) were designed and synthesized with complementary antibacterial functions to act against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. AgNPs-BA&PE could easily get attached and penetrate into the bacterial cell membrane through surface-immobilized BA and PE with a membrane target, resulting in up to 10-fold increase in the antibacterial activity, without the emergence of bacterial resistance. Analysis of the antimicrobial mechanism confirmed that the synthesized nanoparticles caused disorganization of the bacterial cytomembrane and leakage of cytoplasmic contents. This antimicrobial agent with better biocompatibility can promote healing of infected wounds, and has promising and useful applications in biomedical devices and antibacterial control systems.

"Antibacterial resistance to infectious diseases is a significant global concern for health care organizations; along with aging populations and increasing cancer rates, it represents a great burden for government healthcare systems. Therefore, the development of therapies against bacterial infection and cancer is an important strategy for healthcare research. Pathogenic bacteria and cancer have developed a broad range of sophisticated strategies to survive or propagate inside a host and cause infection or spread disease. Bacteria can employ their own metabolism pathways to obtain nutrients from the host cells in order to survive. Similarly, cancer cells can dysregulate normal human cell metabolic pathways so that they can grow and spread. One common feature of the adaption and disruption of metabolic pathways observed in bacterial and cancer cell growth is amino acid pathways; these have recently been targeted as a novel approach to manage bacterial infections and cancer therapy. In particular, arginine metabolism has been illustrated to be important not only for bacterial pathogenesis but also for cancer therapy. Therefore, greater insights into arginine metabolism of pathogenic bacteria and cancer cells would provide possible targets for controlling of bacterial infection and cancer treatment. This review will summarize the recent progress on the relationship of arginine metabolism with bacterial pathogenesis and cancer therapy, with a particular focus on arginase and arginine deiminase pathways of arginine catabolism.",0
"Two new isocoumarin derivatives, including a new 5-hydroxy-8-methyl-2H, 6H-pyrano[3,4-g]chromen-2,6-dione (1) and 6,8-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethylisocoumarin (2b), a new chevalone derivative, named chevalone E (3), and a new natural product pyripyropene S (6) were isolated together with 6, 8-dihydroxy-3-methylisocoumarin (2a), reticulol (2c), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, chevalone B, chevalone C, S14-95 (4), and pyripyropene E (5) from the ethyl acetate extract of the undescribed marine sponge-associated fungus Aspergillus similanensis KUFA 0013. The structures of the new compounds were established based on 1D and 2D NMR spectral analysis, and in the case of compound 3, X-ray analysis was used to confirm its structure and the absolute configuration of its stereogenic carbons. Compounds 1, 2a-c and 3-6 were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, and multidrug-resistant isolates from the environment. Chevalone E (3) was found to show synergism with the antibiotic oxacillin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).",0
"Bacteria sense and respond to many environmental cues, rewiring their regulatory network to facilitate adaptation to new conditions/niches. Global transcription factors that co-regulate multiple pathways simultaneously are essential to this regulatory rewiring. CodY is one such global regulator, controlling expression of both metabolic and virulence genes in Gram-positive bacteria. Branch chained amino acids (BCAAs) serve as a ligand for CodY and modulate its activity. Classically, CodY was considered to function primarily as a repressor under rich growth conditions. However, our previous studies of the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes revealed that CodY is active also when the bacteria are starved for BCAAs. Under these conditions, CodY loses the ability to repress genes (e.g., metabolic genes) and functions as a direct activator of the master virulence regulator gene, prfA. This observation raised the possibility that CodY possesses multiple functions that allow it to coordinate gene expression across a wide spectrum of metabolic growth conditions, and thus better adapt bacteria to the mammalian niche. To gain a deeper understanding of CodY's regulatory repertoire and identify direct target genes, we performed a genome wide analysis of the CodY regulon and DNA binding under both rich and minimal growth conditions, using RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq techniques. We demonstrate here that CodY is indeed active (i.e., binds DNA) under both conditions, serving as a repressor and activator of different genes. Further, we identified new genes and pathways that are directly regulated by CodY (e.g., sigB, arg, his, actA, glpF, gadG, gdhA, poxB, glnR and fla genes), integrating metabolism, stress responses, motility and virulence in L. monocytogenes. This study establishes CodY as a multifaceted factor regulating L. monocytogenes physiology in a highly versatile manner.",0
"Anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs) are antimicrobial peptides with binding and neutralizing activities to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in crustaceans. This study identified and characterized a novel ALF homolog (SpALF4) from the mud crab Scylla paramamosain. The complete cDNA of SpALF4 had 756 bp with a 381 bp open reading frame encoding a protein with 126 aa. The deduced protein contained a signal peptide and a LPS-binding domain. SpALF4 shared the highest identity with PtALF5 at amino acid level but exhibited low similarity with most of other crustacean ALFs. Furthermore, different from the previously identified three SpALF homologs and most of other ALFs, SpALF4 had a low isoelectric point (pI) for the mature peptide and the LPS-binding domain with the values of 6.93 and 6.74, respectively. These results indicate that SpALF4 may be a unique ALF homolog with special biological function in the mud crab. Similar to the spatial structure of ALFPm3, SpALF4 contains three alpha-helices packed against a four-strand beta-sheet, and an amphipathic loop formed by a disulphide bond between two conserved cysteine residues in LPS-binding domain. SpALF4, mainly distributed in hemocytes, could be upregulated by Vibrio harveyi, Staphylococcus aureus, or white spot syndrome virus. Recombinant SpALF4 could inhibit the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (V harveyi, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio alginolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas putida), Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and Bacillus megaterium), and a fungus Candida albicans to varying degrees. Further study showed that it could also bind to all the aforementioned microorganisms excepts. aureus. These results demonstrate that SpALF4 is a unique ALF homolog with potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. This characteristic suggests SpALF4 plays an essential function in immune defense against pathogen invasion in mud crab. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Context: Hyptis suaveolens (Linn.) Poit., Hyptis rhomboidea Mart. et Gal., and Hyptis brevipes Poit., are three species of Hyptis Jacq. (Lamiaceae). Hyptis suaveolens is used for the treatment of fever, headache, gastrointestinal bloating and rheumatism in the traditional folk medicine; Hyptis rhomboidea for hepatitis, ulcer and swollen poison; and Hyptis brevipes for asthma and malaria. Objective: To characterize chemical compositions of the oils from three Hyptis species and evaluate their potential antimicrobial, radical scavenging activities and toxicities against brine shrimp. Materials and methods: The oils were obtained by hydrodistillation, and their chemical compositions were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the tube double-dilution technique. The antioxidant activities were investigated using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and toxicities by the brine shrimp bioassay. Results: Forty-seven, 33 and 28 constituents of oils isolated, respectively, from H. suaveolens, H. rhomboidea and H. brevipes were identified. Among the essential oils, the strongest antioxidant activity was exhibited by H. brevipes with an SC50 value of 2.019 +/- 0.25 mu g mL(-1). The H. brevipes oil exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity (3.125-6.25 mu g mL(-1)) on pathogens employed in the assay. They all showed significant toxicities with median lethal concentration (LC50) values of 62.2 +/- 3.07 mu g mL(-1), 65.9 +/- 6.55 mu g mL(-1) and 60.8 +/- 9.04 mu g mL(-1), respectively. Discussion and conclusions: The three Hyptis species oils possess strong antimicrobial activities and toxicities. Hyptis rhomboidea and H. brevipes showed considerable antioxidant activity compared to the positive control.",0
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis persists inside granulomas in the human lung. Analysis of the metabolic composition of granulomas from guinea pigs revealed that one of the organic acids accumulating in the course of infection is acetate (B. S. Somashekar, A. G. Amin, C. D. Rithner, J. Troudt, R. Basaraba, A. Izzo, D. C. Crick, and D. Chatterjee, J Proteome Res 10:4186-4195, 2011, doi:10.1021/pr2003352), which might result either from metabolism of the pathogen or might be provided by the host itself. Our studies characterize a metabolic pathway by which M. tuberculosis generates acetate in the cause of fatty acid catabolism. The acetate formation depends on the enzymatic activities of Pta and AckA. Using actyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as a substrate, acetyl-phosphate is generated and finally dephosphorylated to acetate, which is secreted into the medium. Knockout mutants lacking either the pta or ackA gene showed significantly reduced acetate production when grown on fatty acids. This effect is even more pronounced when the glyoxylate shunt is blocked, resulting in higher acetate levels released to the medium. The secretion of acetate was followed by an assimilation of the metabolite when other carbon substrates became limiting. Our data indicate that during acetate assimilation, the Pta-AckA pathway acts in concert with another enzymatic reaction, namely, the acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs) reaction. Thus, acetate metabolism might possess a dual function, mediating an overflow reaction to release excess carbon units and resumption of acetate as a carbon substrate. IMPORTANCE During infection, host-derived lipid components present the major carbon source at the infection site. beta-Oxidation of fatty acids results in the formation of acetyl-CoA. In this study, we demonstrate that consumption of fatty acids by Mycobacterium tuberculosis activates an overflow mechanism, causing the pathogen to release excess carbon intermediates as acetate. The Pta-AckA pathway mediating acetate formation proved to be reversible, enabling M. tuberculosis to reutilize the previously secreted acetate as a carbon substrate for metabolism.",0
"1,3-Thiazole is one of the most important scaffolds in heterocyclic chemistry and drug design and discovery.

"Protein-protein interactions can be studied in vitro, e.g. with bacterial or yeast two-hybrid systems or surface plasmon resonance. In contrast to in vitro techniques, in vivo studies of protein-protein interactions allow examination of spatial and temporal behavior of such interactions in their native environment. One approach to study protein-protein interactions in vivo is via Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Here, FRET efficiency of selected FRET-pairs was studied at the single cell level using sensitized emission and Frequency Domain-Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FD-FLIM). For FRET-FLIM, a prototype Modulated Electron-Multiplied FLIM system was used, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first account of Frequency Domain FLIM to analyze FRET in single bacterial cells. To perform FRET-FLIM, we first determined and benchmarked the best fluorescent protein-pair for FRET in Bacillus subtilis using a novel BglBrick-compatible integration vector. We show that GFP-tagRFP is an excellent donor-acceptor pair for B. subtilis in vivo FRET studies. As a proof of concept, selected donor and acceptor fluorescent proteins were fused using a linker that contained a tobacco etch virus (TEV)-protease recognition sequence. Induction of TEV-protease results in loss of FRET efficiency and increase in fluorescence lifetime. The loss of FRET efficiency after TEV induction can be followed in time in single cells via time-lapse microscopy. This work will facilitate future studies of in vivo dynamics of protein complexes in single B. subtilis cells.",0
"To investigate antibacterial activity against the tomato pathogen Clavibacter michiganense subsp. michiganense ATCC 7429 (Cmm ATCC 7429), Bacillus subtilis DJM-51 was isolated from rhizosphere soil. For isolation of bacteria, samples were taken from rhizosphere soil. The isolate, DJA-51, had strong antagonistic ability against Tomato pathogen Cmm ATCC 7429 on nutrient-broth yeast extract agar (NBYA) as indicated by inhibition zones around colonies. On the basis of the nucleotide sequence of a conserved segment of the 16S rRNA gene, the bacterium has been identified as B. subtilis DJM-51. The growth of Cmm ATCC 7429 on NBYA plates was inhibited by culture broth of B. subtilis DJM-51 including cells, by the supernatant of culture broth of B. subtilis DJM-51, and by the liquid material resulting from butanol extract of bacterial cultures. The OD value in co-culture mixture was lower than the control throughout the entire incubation period. Antibiotics obtained from B. subtilis DJM-51 inhibited the growth of Tomato pathogen Cmm ATCC 7429. These results provide potentially information about the protection of tomato from pathogen Cmm ATCC 7429 under greenhouse conditions in Quebec. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Vacuolating cytotoxic activity in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264 was reported in Pasteurella multocida B: 2 strains associated with haemorrhagic septicaemia in buffaloes and cattle. A putative virulence-related gene mviN was reported in the sequenced genome of P. multocida serotype A (avian strain Pm70). MviN is an integral membrane protein that belongs to MATE (multi-antimicrobial extrusion) family. The present study was undertaken to detect the presence of putative virulence-related genes, viz. vacB and mviN among P. multocida B: 2 strains (8). Sequence information for the vacB gene was obtained from the sequenced genome of P. multocida serotype A (avian strain Pm70). Oligonucleotide primers were designed for these genes and synthesized. All the 8 P. multocida B: 2 strains, 1 P. multocida type A 3 (bovine) and 1 P. multocida type D (pig) strain had both of these genes of the expected size (1.5 Kb for mviN and 2.4 Kb for vacB) as confirmed by PCR. E. coli K12 used as negative control did not show any band. Both these putative virulence-related genes were amplified in a single reaction mixture using multiplex PCR. The expected size (1.5 Kb for mviN and 2.4 Kb for vacB) of both the genes was obtained. This is the first report of the detection of these virulence-related genes among P. multocida B: 2 strains. Besides providing additional targets for diagnostic applications, the identification and subsequent analysis of virulence-related genes in P. multocida B: 2 strains may help in improving our understanding of molecular mechanism of adaptation, survival and virulence of P. multocida B: 2.",0
"A series of novel 2H-chromen-2-one derivatives decorated with 1,2,3-triazole moiety were designed and synthesized using the click reaction of azidoalkyloxy-2H-chromen-2-ones with different propargylamines. Propargylamines were obtained by alkylation of various heterocyclic amines with propargyl bromide. Newly synthesized compounds and intermediates were evaluated for their antifungal activity against four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans). Antibacterial studies were also carried out against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermis) and four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae). In vitro, bioassay results showed that all the synthesized compounds exhibited excellent activity against fungal strains Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans. Interestingly, all the compounds have shown even superior activity than the reference drug miconazole against Aspergillus fumigatus. Morpholine and N-acetyl piperazine containing compounds 10c and 10e have shown promising activity against various bacterial strains. Compound 10e was found to be most active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on, in silico pharmacokinetic studies, compounds 10a-e were identified as lead compounds for future investigation due to their lower toxicity, high drug score values and good oral bioavailability as per OECD guidelines.

"A series of fifteen novel triazinyl derivatives, with various natural nucleobases by mono, di and tri substitution in cyanuric chloride at the 2,4- and/or 6-positions was synthesized. Target molecules were synthesized by stoichiometric addition of various nucleophiles to cyanuric chloride in the presence of suitable base. The structural characterizations of all the compounds were made by spectral and analytical techniques, IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and 2D NMR (HSQC, HMBC), mass spectral and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against a panel of selected bacterial and fungal strains using Streptomycin and Amphotericin B as standards. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) results revealed that most of the purine (1a-2a, 1b-2b, and 1c-2c) compounds exhibit excellent activity against selected bacterial and fungal strains.

"Chitosan (partially deacetylated chitin), a component of fungal cell walls, caused epidermal cell (EC) death in the leaves of pea (Pisum sativum L.) and tobacco Nicotiana tabacum or Nicotiana benthamiana detected by destruction of cell nuclei. The mitochondria-targeted quinone SkQ1 prevented the destruction of EC nuclei induced by chitosan. Chitosan increased and SkQ1 suppressed the activity of protein kinases in N. benthamiana and P. sativum and eliminated the effect of chitosan. Chitosan induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the guard cells (GC) of pea plants. Treatment with chitosan or H2O2 did not cause destruction of GC nuclei; however, it resulted in disruption of the permeability barrier of the plasma membrane detected by propidium iodide fluorescence. Treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide but not peptidoglycan caused destruction of pea EC nuclei, which was prevented by SkQ1. Leaves of tobacco plants containing the N gene responsible for resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells. These cells contained a genetic construct with the gene of the helicase domain of TMV replicase (p50); its protein product p50 is a target for the N-gene product. As a result, the hypersensitive response (HR) was initiated. The HR manifested itself in the death of leaves and was suppressed by SkQ3. Treatment of tobacco epidermal peels with the A. tumefaciens cells for the p50 gene expression stimulated the destruction of EC nuclei, which was inhibited by SkQ1 or SkQ3. The p50-lacking A. tume-faciens cells did not induce the destruction of EC nuclei. The protective effect of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants SkQ1 and SkQ3 demonstrates the involvement of mitochondria and their ROS in programmed cell death caused by pathogen elicitors.",0
"We investigated the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from raw shelled and roasted salted pistachios. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), food and clinical isolates, of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mirabilis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis and the fungus Aspergillus niger were used. Pistachio extracts were active against Gram-positive bacteria with a bactericidal effect observed against L.monocytogenes (ATCC strains and food isolates), S.aureus and MRSA clinical isolates. Extracts from raw shelled pistachios were more active than those from roasted salted pistachios. The bactericidal activity of pistachio extracts could be used to help control the growth of some microorganisms in foods to improve safety and may find application as a topical treatment for S.aureus.",0
"Safe drinking water is the one which is free of both chemical and microbial contaminants. But these days water borne diseases like cholera, typhoid etc. are increasing by the microbial community in drinking water which proves that the current disinfection methods are not sufficient. Some organisms are capable of producing bio films and show resistance to treating agents like chlorination. There is evidence that drinking water may be the source of infections with non-tuberculous Mycobacteria in human. Though chlorination was suggested to be the best method of disinfection, Mycobacterium is still resistant to this treatment. The effect of H 2O 2 and HOCl in Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium aurum were studied in this present work with initial concentrations of 2 to 15 mg/l of hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid for test cases (0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30 mM). Oxidative stress induced in these microbial cultures and ROS was measured along with the cell viability. There was a direct relationship between the superoxide levels and the concentration of the treating agents. Treatment with disinfectants produced the expected decrease in cell concentrations. Higher concentration levels of disinfectants to larger cell decreases.",0
"Isolates of Rhizoctonia spp. associated with stem canker and black scurf disease of potato were examined for their anastomosis group, sequence variations in the ITS-5.8S rDNA region, pathogenicity and sensitivity to fungicides. A total of 92 isolates were obtained from diseased tuber, stolon and sprouts of the potato plants, collected from five districts of Bolu province, Turkey. Based on the anastomosis group and the similarity of the nucleotide sequence of the ITS-5.8S rDNA, most of the isolates (81.5%) were identified as AG 3 PT. Other isolates belonged to AG 2-1 (1.08%), AG 2-2 IV (1.08%), AG 4 HG II (8.07%), AG 5 (2.17%), binucleate Rhizoctonia AG A (1.08%) and AG K (4.35%). Pathogenicity tests showed that isolates of AG 3 PT, AG 4 HG II and AG 5 caused similar degrees of disease severity on 45-day-old potato seedlings, whereas AG 2-1 was moderately virulent. AG 2-2 IV and binucleate Rhizoctonia spp. were weakly pathogenic or non-pathogenic on potato seedlings. In this study, anastomosis groups of Rhizoctonia spp. isolates associated with potato in Turkey were characterized for the first time using molecular techniques and classified at the level of subgroups. Furthermore, the effect of selected fungicides was evaluated on disease development caused by soil-borne inoculums of different anastomosis groups (AGs). Flutolanil and Bacillus subtilis QST 713 were found to be most effective against the Rhizoctonia isolates tested. These results revealed significant differences among the fungicides on disease development resulted from the different AGs.",0
"Chemical investigation of the ethanol extract of the whole plant of Megacodon stylophorus led to the isolation and identification of two new secohopane triterpenoids, 2,3-seco-22(29)-hopene-2-carboxyl-3-aldehyde (1) and 2,3-seco-4(23),22 (29)-hopene-2-carboxyl-3-aldehyde (2), along with 10 known compounds, 3-12. All the isolates were reported from this plant for the first time. The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were determined by detailed analysis of their spectral data including 1D and 2D NMR. In addition, compound 1 was further analyzed by X-ray crystallography. Compounds 1-3 were evaluated for their in vitro anti-proliferative activities on HeLa, MCF-7, and Hep-G2 tumor cell lines. Compound 2 was active against the three cell lines with IC50 values of 3.6, 7.5, and 13.6 mu M, respectively, while compound 1 exhibited cytotoxicity on MCF-7 (IC50 14.0 mu M) and HeLa (IC50 18.2 mu M) cell lines. Antimicrobial activities of compounds 1-2 (minimum inhibitory concentration values in the range of 3.12-12.50 mg/mL) were also observed.",0
"Seaweed-associated heterotrophic bacterial communities were screened to isolate potentially useful antimicrobial strains, which were characterized by phylogenetic analysis. The bacteria were screened for the presence of metabolite genes involved in natural product biosynthetic pathway, and the structural properties of secondary metabolites were correlated with the genes. Bioactivity-guided isolation of polyene antibiotic 7-O-methyl-5'-hydroxy-3'-heptenoate-macrolactin from Bacillus subtilis MTCC10403 associated with seaweed Anthophycus longifolius using mass spectrometry and extensive 2D-NMR studies was carried out. The newly isolated macrolactin compound is a bactericidal antibiotic with broad spectrum activity against human opportunistic clinical pathogens. The biosynthetic pathway of 7-O-methyl-5'-hydroxy-3'-heptenoate-macrolactin by means of a stepwise, decarboxylative condensation pathway established the PKS-assisted biosynthesis of the parent macrolactin and the side-chain 5-hydroxyhept-3-enoate moiety attached to the macrolactin ring system at C-7. Antimicrobial activity analysis combined with the results of amplifying genes encoding for polyketide synthetase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase showed that seaweed-associated bacteria had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The present work may have an impact on the exploitation of macrolactins for pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications.",0
"Some years ago, MRSA clonal complex (CC) 398 emerged, which spread extensively in livestock animals. People in contact with food production animals are at high risk of colonization. A reduction of MRSA CC398 in livestock might be achieved by application of virulent phages. However, there have not yet been any reports published on phages lysing MRSA CC398 strains. In this study, three virulent phages (PSa1, PSa2 and PSa3) with lytic activity against MRSA CC398 strains were isolated from German pig farms. Morphologically, the phages are members of the family Podoviridae, and they exhibited an identical host range. They lysed 52 (60 %) out of 86 tested MRSA CC398 strains representing 18 different spa types. While the PSa1 and PSa3 genomes have a similar size of approximately 17.5 kb, the PSa2 genome is somewhat larger (ca. 18.5 kb). Southern hybridization revealed strong DNA homologies between the phages, which was confirmed by sequence analysis of cloned restriction fragments and PCR products. Moreover, the whole PSa3 genomic sequence (17,602 bp) showed a close relationship to 44AHJD-like phages, which are not known to contain virulence-associated genes. To assess whether these phages might be candidates for applications, in vitro experiments were carried out in which the number of MRSA CC398 cells could be reduced by up to four log(10) units. The phages were stable at a wide range of temperatures and pH values.",0
"This report is to our knowledge the first to study plant growth promotion and biocontrol characteristics of Bacillus isolates from extreme environments of Eastern Algeria. Seven isolates of 14 (50 %) were screened for their ability to inhibit growth of some phytopathogenic fungi on PDA and some roots exudates. The bacteria identification based on 16S r-RNA and gyrase-A gene sequence analysis showed that 71 % of the screened isolates belonged to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and the rest were closely related to B. atrophaeus and B. mojavensis. Most of them had high spore yields (22x10(8)-27x10(8) spores/ml). They produced protease and cellulase cell wall-degrading enzymes while the chitinase activity was only observed in the B. atrophaeus (6SEL). A wide variety of lipopeptides homologous was detected by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, some additional peaks with new masses were characterized, which may correspond to new fengycin classes. The isolates produced siderophores and indole-3- acetic acid phytohormone. The greenhouse experiment using a naturally infested soil with Sclerotonia sclerotiorum showed that the B. atrophaeus (6SEL) significantly increased the size of the chickpea plants and reduced the stem rot disease (P<0.05). These results suggest that these isolates may be used further as bio-inoculants to improve crop systems.",0
"One of the most important achievements of bacteria is its capability to adapt to the changing conditions of the environment. The competition for nutrients with other microorganisms, especially in the soil, where nutritional conditions are more variable, has led bacteria to evolve a plethora of mechanisms to rapidly fine-tune the requirements of the cell. One of the essential nutrients that are normally found in low concentrations in nature is inorganic phosphate (Pi). Bacteria, as well as other organisms, have developed several systems to cope for the scarcity of this nutrient. To date, the unique mechanism responding to Pi starvation known in detail is the Pho regulon, which is normally controlled by a two component system and constitutes one of the most sensible and efficient regulatory mechanisms in bacteria. Many new members of the Pho regulon have emerged in the last years in several bacteria; however, there are still many unknown questions regarding the activation and function of the whole system. This review describes the most important findings of the last three decades in relation to Pi regulation in bacteria, including: the PHO box, the Pi signaling pathway and the Pi starvation response. The role of the Pho regulon in nutritional regulation cross-talk, secondary metabolite production, and pathogenesis is discussed in detail.",0
"Every day, food processing industries release wastes, which are environmental menance. Chicken feathers have been discarded in bulk as waste from poultry industries, globally. Degrading these wastes, as unused disposals, without acquiring any additional benefits has led to an idea to develop a new technology. We have reported earlier that Bacillus thuringiensis serovar israelensis (Bti) can be used for biodegradation of feather waste for biopesticide production. In the present study, purification and characterization of keratinase from feather degrading bacterium (Bti) is reported. Protein precipitate obtained at Ammonium sulphate saturation at 60% level and Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography resulted in 2.3 and 11.68 fold purification of the enzyme respectively. The purity was revealed in SDS-PAGE by a single band of molecular weight of 40 kDa and it was characterized. The optimum pH of the enzyme shifted to a more neutral range (6.0-8.0) with the highest activity (7.0). The optimum temperature of the reaction was determined to be 30 degrees C. The keratinase enzyme retained 51% residual activity (303 U/mg protein) at 70 degrees C (60 min) and the half-lives of the enzyme were 130 minutes at 40 degrees C, 90 min at 50 degrees C and of 60 min at 70 degrees C, respectively. Keratinase activity was enhanced by calcium and magnesium ions while EDTA, PMSF, beta-mercaptoethanol and manganese inhibited the activity. This is the first report investigating the keratinase from Bti degraded chicken feathers for the bio-synthesis of mosquitocidal toxins.",0
"Staphylococcus aureus resistance to antibiotics is a significant clinical problem worldwide. In this study, an untargeted lipidomics approach was used to compare the lipid fingerprints of S. aureus clinical isolates that are resistant and sensitive to antibiotics. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was employed to rapidly and comprehensively analyze bacterial lipids. Chemometric and statistical analyses of the obtained lipid fingerprints revealed variations in several lipid groups between S. aureus strains resistant and sensitive to tested antibiotics including methicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and fusidic acid. The levels of identified monoglycosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and diglycosyldiacylglycerol lipid groups were found to be upregulated in antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains, whereas the levels of diacylglycerol lipid groups were downregulated. Differences in the lipid patterns between sensitive and resistant S. aureus strains suggest that antibiotic susceptibility may be associated with the lipid composition of bacterial cells. The lipids that were found to significantly differ between antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive clinical isolates are involved in the biosynthesis of major S. aureus membrane lipids and lipoteichoic acid. This study indicates that S. aureus lipid biosynthesis pathways should be explored further to better understand the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus strains.",0
"The production of highly efficient, recyclable and cost-effective enzymes is one of the most important goals in industrial biotechnology. Bacterial spores are highly resistant to harsh environmental conditions, easy to produce and are suitable for manipulation of genetic materials. These features make them a very efficient tool for biotechnology. Here, we show the use bacterial spores for presentation of functional enzyme. Spore coat display was used to produce a biocatalyst, which expresses beta-galactiosidase (LacA). This enzyme is commonly used to produce lactose-free milk for lactose intolerant individuals. The lacA gene from Bacillus subtilis strain 168 was expressed on the surface of B. subtilis RH101(Delta cotC) spores using CotC as protein carrier. Presence of LacA protein is verified by western blotting. Results of beta-galactiosidase assay show that the expressed enzyme retained its activity in condition of freezing and drying, as well as after recovery from the reaction's mixture.",0
"Bacterial pathogens, including several Vibrio spp. and Roseovarius crassostreae, cause severe mortality of larval and juvenile eastern oysters. The introduction of beneficial bacterial isolates in oyster hatcheries and nurseries for the biocontrol of bacterial diseases is a good alternative to the use of antibiotics. The goal of this study was to screen and characterize marine bacterial isolates as potential agents to prevent larval and juvenile mortality by the oyster pathogens Vibrio tubiashii and R. crassostreae. Screening of bacterial isolates from Rhode Island marine organisms and environment using agar-based assay methods for detection of antimicrobial activity against oyster pathogens led to the isolation of candidate probionts Phaeobacter sp. S4 and Bacillus pumilus RI06-95. Pretreatment of larval and juvenile oysters for 24 h with 10(2)-10(6) cfu/mL Phaeobacter sp. S4 or B. pumilus RI06-95 protected larval oysters against mortality resulting from challenge with R. crassostreae and V. tubiashii (relative percent survival (RPS) range, 9%-56%). These probiotics also protected juvenile oysters against challenge with V. tubiashii (RPS, 37%-50%). Probiotic isolates had no negative impact on oyster survival. Protection conferred to larvae against bacterial challenge was short-lived, lasting for only 24 h after removal of the probiotics from the incubation water. These results suggest the potential of marine bacterial isolates Phaeobacter sp. S4 and B. pumilus RI06-95 to serve as biocontrol agents to reduce the impact of bacterial pathogens in the culture of Crassostrea virginica.",0
"Active support is needed for low copy-number plasmids to be stably maintained in bacterial cells. The mechanisms that fulfill this role are (i) partition systems (PAR) acting to separate plasmid molecules to daughter cells and (ii) toxin-andidote (TA) (post-segregational killing-PSK) systems which arrest cell growth until the plasmid reaches the correct copy-number or kill the cells that have not inherited the plasmid. Our knowledge of toxin-antidote systems comes mainly from studies on Gram-negative bacteria. However, some addiction systems of Gram-positive bacteria have been characterized in detail or recently identified. Altogether, they bring new interesting data on toxin-antidote functioning in bacteria.",0
"A series of novel 1-methyl-3-substituted quinazoline-2,4-dione derivatives was designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against six strains of bacteria and five fungi in vitro. The synthesized compounds were characterized by spectral methods. The bioactive assays showed that most of the compounds exhibited moderate antimicrobial activities against the tested strains.",0
"Different fractions of root and stem of Derris scandens demonstrated good antibacterial (Escherichia coli, and Bacillus megaterium), antialgal (Chlorella fusca), and antifungal (Microbotryum violaceum) activities. Phytochemical investigation resulted in isolation of scandenin, scandenin A, betulinic acid, lupeol, beta-amyran-3-one, beta-amyrin, beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterol glucopyranoside. Study showed that scandenin has strong antibacterial activity against B. megaterium and good antifungal and antialgal properties. Scandenin A showed good antibacterial, antifungal and antialgal properties. (C) 2015 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.",0
"The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is dependent on purine salvage from the host environment for survival. The genes bbb22 and bbb23 encode purine permeases that are essential for Borrelia burgdorferi mouse infectivity. We now demonstrate the unique contributions of each of these genes to purine transport and murine infection. The affinities of spirochetes carrying bbb22 alone for hypoxanthine and adenine were similar to those of spirochetes carrying both genes. Spirochetes carrying bbb22 alone were able to achieve wild-type levels of adenine saturation but not hypoxanthine saturation, suggesting that maximal hypoxanthine uptake requires the presence of bbb23. Moreover, the purine transport activity conferred by bbb22 was dependent on an additional distal transcriptional start site located within the bbb23 open reading frame. The initial rates of uptake of hypoxanthine and adenine by spirochetes carrying bbb23 alone were below the level of detection. However, these spirochetes demonstrated a measurable increase in hypoxanthine uptake over a 30-min time course. Our findings indicate that bbb22-dependent adenine transport is essential for Borrelia burgdorferi survival in mice. The bbb23 gene was dispensable for Borrelia burgdorferi mouse infectivity, yet its presence was required along with that of bbb22 for Borrelia burgdorferi to achieve maximal spirochete loads in infected mouse tissues. These data demonstrate that both genes, bbb22 and bbb23, are critical for Borrelia burgdorferi to achieve wild-type infection of mice and that the differences in the capabilities of the two transporters may reflect distinct purine salvage needs that the spirochete encounters throughout its natural infectious cycle.",0
"Whey acidic proteins (WAP) belong to a large gene family of antibacterial peptides that perform critical immune system functions. The function of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), a 124-amino acid long polypeptide that has two whey acidic protein four-disulfide core (WFDC) domains, is not well studied. Here, a fusion gene encoding the HE4 protein fused to an IgG1 Fc domain was constructed. The recombinant HE4 protein was expressed as a secretory protein in Pichia pastoris and mammalian HEK293-F cells and was subsequently purified. Our data suggested that the HE4 protein produced by these two expression systems bound to both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, but demonstrated slightly inhibitory activity towards the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, HE4 exhibited proteinase inhibitory activity towards trypsin, elastase, matrix metallopeptidase 9, and the secretory proteinases from Bacillus subtilis. The effects of glycosylation on the biochemical characterization of HE4 were also investigated. LC-ESI-MS glycosylation analysis showed that the high-mannose glycosylated form of HE4 expressed by P. pastoris has lower biological activity when compared to its complex-glycosylated form produced from HEK293-F cells. The implications of this are discussed, which may be provide theoretical basis for its important role in the development of cancer and innate immune system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"Twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. All the compounds had MICs between 0.49 and 15.63 mu g/ml toward Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. In order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) at MICs of 1.95-7.81 mu g/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at MICs of 0.49-1.95 mu g/ml and MDR-MRSA at MIC of 0.98 and 3.90 mu g/ml, respectively. Finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. The majority of cells in biofilm populations of MSSA and MRSA were eradicated at low level of 3, with MBICs in the range of 7.82-15.63 mu g/ml.",0
"Formation of endospores allows some bacteria to survive extreme nutrient limitation. The resulting dormant cell, the spore, persists in the environment and is highly resistant to physical and chemical stresses. During spore formation, cells divide asymmetrically and the mother cell engulfs the developing spore, encasing it within a double membrane and isolating it from the medium. Communication between mother cell and isolated forespore involves a specialised connection system that allows nurturing of the forespore and continued macromolecular synthesis, required to finalise spore maturation. Here, we review current understanding of this feeding channel formed by a forespore protein, SpoIIQ, and a mother cell protein, SpoIIIAH, in the model organism Bacillus subtilis and the important human pathogen Clostridium difficile. We also analyse the presence of this channel across endospore-forming bacteria and highlight the main questions still remaining.",0
"The use of antibiotics to treat mastitis and other infectious diseases in dairy sheep and goats is a widespread practice nowadays that can, when not properly applied, result in the contamination of the milk supply. Spanish legislation establishes the control of the presence of antibiotic residues in sheep and goat's milk using screening methods that detect, at least, beta-lactam drugs. Microbial inhibitor tests using Geobacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis and specific receptor-binding assays are most widely employed for this purpose. The detection rates of screening tests routinely used in Spain have been calculated considering the frequency of use of veterinary drugs commonly applied in ovine and caprine livestock to treat and prevent mastitis as well as the test sensitivity toward these substances at safety levels. In general, the use of a single test allows detecting 62.8-82.4% of the antibiotics employed. For sheep milk, the total detection range achieved with microbial tests was significantly higher than that reached with rapid receptor tests. However, no significant differences between the two types of methods were found when goat's milk was analysed. In both types of milk, the simultaneous use of two screening tests with a different analytical basis increases the total detection range significantly, reaching values >= 90% in some cases (81.5-90.1% for sheep and 84.7-92.6% for goats). However, the periodical use of screening tests able to detect quinolones, macrolides or aminoglycosides would be recommended to carry out more efficient screening and ensure the safety of milk and dairy products from sheep and goats.",0
"The biocontrol activity of many Bacillus species has been traditionally related to the direct antagonism of pathogens. In previous works, we reported that B. subtilis strain UMAF6614 was an efficient biocontrol agent that produced bacillomycin, fengycin and surfactin lipopeptides. Bacillomycins and fengycins were shown to have antagonistic activity towards fungal and bacterial pathogens of cucurbits; however, the functionality of surfactin remained unclear. In this study, the role of surfactin in the biocontrol activity of this strain was investigated. We observed that a deficiency in surfactin production led to a partial reduction of disease suppression by this biocontrol agent, which coincided with a defect in biofilm formation and the colonization of the melon phylloplane. These effects were due to a dramatic reduction in the production of exopolysaccharide and the TasA protein, which are the two major components of the extracellular matrix. We propose that the biocontrol activity of this strain is the result of the coordinated action of the three families of lipopeptides. B. subtilis UMAF6614 produces surfactin to trigger biofilm formation on melon phylloplane, which ensures the long-term persistence and the adequate secretion of suppressive lipopeptides, bacillomycins and fengycins, which efficiently target pathogens.",0
"Virulence of the nosocomial pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis is crucially linked to formation of adherent biofilms on artificial surfaces. Biofilm assembly is significantly fostered by production of a bacteria derived extracellular matrix. However, the matrix composition, spatial organization, and relevance of specific molecular interactions for integration of bacterial cells into the multilayered biofilm community are not fully understood. Here we report on the function of novel 18 kDa Small basic protein (Sbp) that was isolated from S. epidermidis biofilm matrix preparations by an affinity chromatographic approach. Sbp accumulates within the biofilm matrix, being preferentially deposited at the biofilm-substratum interface. Analysis of Sbp-negative S. epidermidis mutants demonstrated the importance of Sbp for sustained colonization of abiotic surfaces, but also epithelial cells. In addition, Sbp promotes assembly of S. epidermidis cell aggregates and establishment of multilayered biofilms by influencing polysaccharide intercellular-adhesin (PIA) and accumulation associated protein (Aap) mediated intercellular aggregation. While inactivation of Sbp indirectly resulted in reduced PIA-synthesis and biofilm formation, Sbp serves as an essential ligand during Aap domain-B mediated biofilm accumulation. Our data support the conclusion that Sbp serves as an S. epidermidis biofilm scaffold protein that significantly contributes to key steps of surface colonization. Sbp-negative S. epidermidis mutants showed no attenuated virulence in a mouse catheter infection model. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of sbp in commensal and invasive S. epidermidis populations suggests that Sbp plays a significant role as a co-factor during both multi-factorial commensal colonization and infection of artificial surfaces.",0
"To investigate the effect of Bacillus coagulans on blood serum antioxidant indices of broiler chickens under Clostridium perfringens challenge, a total of 312 male broilers (Cobb 500) were randomly assigned to 4 experimental treatments. The 4 treatment groups were an uninfected control and an infected control supplemented with B. coagulans at 0 and 400 mg per kg feed. The feeding trial lasted for 42 d. Supplementation of B. coagulans significantly improved ADG and feed conversation ration (FCR) during d 14 to 21. Salmonella enteritidis (SE) infection significantly increased the MDA content at 7 d after infection and significantly decreased the T-AOC and CAT at 15 d after infection. Supplementation of B. coagulans significantly increased the activity of T-SOD and the content of NO 7 d after infection, and significantly increased the activity of T-AOC and significantly increased the activity of CAT at 15 d after infection. Supplementation with B. coagulans significantly decreased the content of MDA and extremely significantly increased the activity of T-SOD at 30 d after infection. The results indicated that SE challenge had an adverse effect on the antioxidant function of broilers, and supplementation of B. coagulans could improve antioxidant capacity against oxidative stress due to SE challenge in broiler chickens.",0
"The strains having antagonistic activity against Verticillium dahliae Kleb were isolated and screened from the soil of cotton fields from different regions. A strain named LZ2-70 with a rather higher antagonistic activity was obtained. The morphology characteristics, physiological and biochemical properties and 16S rRNA gene sequence of this strain were further studied. The strain LZ2-70 was finally identified as a type of Bacillus subtilis. The antagonistic substance was antifungal protein. Through single factor experiment and orthogonal experiment, the optimal shaking flask fermentation condition of strain LZ2-70 was determined as follows: medium composed of 5% amidulin, 1% peptone, 0.03% MnCl2, 0.01% KCl, initial pH 8.0 and 10% inoculation volume, media volume 30/250 (mL/mL), fermentation temperature 37 degrees C, rotating speed 200 r/min, fermentation time 96 h. A distinguished elevation of the antagonistic activity was observed at about 41.1%.",0
"Moringa oleifera plant has nutritional contents which are diseases preventing and it has been used from ancient age in the treatment, prevention of disease or infection. The essential vitamins and minerals are used to prevent and cure the diseases and to save the populations from microbial infection and that may be a most potent antimicrobial medicine from natural source. So it is important to study the phytoconstituents of different part of the plant. The plant have been used for various diseases in the folk medicine and the secondary metabolites is the most important bioactive constituents which include alkaloids, phenolic compounds, tannins, phytosterols and terpenoids are the most popular phytomedicine works instead of antibiotics and that have lesser side effects or adverse effects or other hypersensitive reactions or allergic reactions. So, there have possibility of good antimicrobial and antifungal activity. Now there have many studies available on leaves extract but there has no sufficient study on flower. So the comparable study of the leaves and flower constituents is beneficial for future. In the sense the plant has a rich polyphenolic compounds so there may have most useful antioxidant activity.",0
"Yellow sigatoka caused by Mycosphaerella musicola (Leach) is economically important disease on banana in Tamil Nadu. Antagonistic bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BS 30, 15) and Bacillus subtilis (BS 13) were used to control yellow sigatoka of banana (Musa spp.) under glasshouse conditions. Superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide generation rates and changes in phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were studied in banana plants. Banana plants treated with Bacillus showed the maximum activity of these four enzymes occurred at 7th day in different stages upon pathogen inoculation compared with untreated control plants. CAT is the key H2O2 detoxifying enzymes. This work supports the view that increased antioxidant enzyme activities could be involved at least in part the beneficial effects of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria strains on the performance of banana grown under the pathogen infection conditions.",0
"Toxin expression of Cry1Ac was studied in plant parts of Bollgard II cotton genotype MRC 7031 sown on different planting dates and receiving different treatments of nitrogen application. The expression was quantified by using Cry1Ac/Ab ELISA kit. Mean per cent mortality of one day old larvae of Helicoverpa armigera was observed on different plant parts of Bollgard II and its respective non Bt cotton genotype. The studies indicated that at higher nitrogen doses i.e 225 and 300 kg/ha, maximum expression of Cry1Ac was observed, while the expression was minimum at low nitrogen doses i.e 150 kg/ha. Among different planting dates, the expression of Cry1Ac was found to be maximum during late sown (15th May) as compared to early sown crop (Ist May and 15th April). Quantitative expression of Cry1Ac was found to be variable among different plant parts, it was more in leaves followed by squares and bolls. Mortality of H. armigera was significantly more at higher nitrogen doses i.e 225 and 300 kg/ha than 150 kg/ha. Statistically non significant difference in mortality was observed between different planting dates.",0
"The presence of pyrogens in the human body can activate the immune system leading to pathological effects, such as fever, tissue damage, septic shock, possibly even death. This is a major concern in the pharmaceutical field where injectable solutions are widely used. The main pyrogens are the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules from Gram-negative bacteria and the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria. Conventional sterilization methods cannot fully inactivate these molecules. A significant decrease of the pyrogenic activity of both LPS and LTA is obtained after exposure to the flowing afterglow of a N-2-O-2 discharge. We also investigated the level of pyrogenic activity ensuing from the inactivation of bacterial spores by the flowing afterglow.",0
"A microorganism inhibits the growth of various plant pathogens, and is not reduced in its efficacy even when the microorganism is used in combination with a chemical pesticide.

"Objectives: Psoralea corylifolia L. (seeds) and Plumbago zeylanica L. (bark) were combined in the ratio of 8: 2 and named as ""Swithranasini"" and used for the treatment of skin diseases in ayurvedic medicine. Scientific studies validating the therapeutic properties for this indigenous medicine are lacking. This study focused on determining antimicrobial efficacy of methanol and butter milk extracts along with antioxidant efficacies of these plant parts independently and in combination. Materials and Methods: Antimicrobial activity was tested against seven pathogenic bacteria and six pathogenic fungi by measuring the zone of inhibition. In vitro antioxidant activities were assayed by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method and Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method. Results: Individual extracts of the two plants showed better zone of inhibition (12- 40 mm) when applied alone but the activity was more when applied in combination (18-50 mm) against the tested pathogens. DPPH activity of methanol extracts showed higher radical scavenging activity when compared with the positive control, ascorbic acid. The IC 50 values are 442.080, 457.825, 432.040 and 394.563 ug/ml for A, B, A+B and ascorbic acid respectively. The FRAP method also showed excellent antioxidant potential in combination (85.454 mg of Gallic acid equivalents/g) when compared with individual extracts A (78.571 mg GAE/g) and B (75.472 mg GAE/g). Conclusion: The results validate the potent use of ""Swithranasini"" against skin infections and results are an evidence for the existence of synergism among the compounds.",0
"Cell division in bacteria is initiated by the polymerization of FtsZ into a ring-like structure at midcell that functions as a scaffold for the other cell division proteins. In Bacillus subtilis, the conserved cell division protein EzrA is involved in modulation of Z-ring formation and coordination of septal peptidoglycan synthesis. Here, we show that an ezrA mutant is hypersensitive to tetracycline, even when the tetracycline efflux pump TetA is present. This effect is not related to the protein translation inhibiting activity of tetracycline. Overexpression of FtsL suppresses this phenotype, which appears to be related to the intrinsic low FtsL levels in an ezrA mutant background. A transposon screen indicated that the tetracycline effect can also be suppressed by overproduction of the cell division protein ZapA. In addition, tetracycline sensitivity could be suppressed by transposon insertions in galE and the unknown gene ypmB, which was renamed tseB (tetracycline sensitivity suppressor of ezrA). GalE is an epimerase using UDP-glucose and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as substrate. Deletion of this protein bypasses the synthetic lethality of zapA ezrA and sepF ezrA double mutations, indicating that GalE influences cell division. The transmembrane protein TseB contains an extracytoplasmic peptidase domain, and a GFP fusion shows that the protein is enriched at cell division sites. A tseB deletion causes a shorter cell phenotype, indicating that TseB plays a role in cell division. Why a deletion of ezrA renders B. subtilis cells hypersensitive for tetracycline remains unclear. We speculate that this phenomenon is related to the tendency of tetracycline analogs to accumulate into the lipid bilayer, which may destabilize certain membrane proteins.",0
"Several new cyclic and acyclic naphthalimide and allylidene derivatives have been synthesized following the conventional and microwave synthetic methods and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains, like B. subtilis (NCIM-2156), S. aureus (NCIM-2079), S. epidermis (NCIM-2493), P. aeruginosa (NCIM-2036), E. coli (NCIM-2065), and P. vulgaris (NCIM 2027) following broth dilution method using ciprofloxacin and vancomycin as reference. All compounds showed MIC values in the range of < 0.65-80 mu g/mL concentration. Compound 6 showed the maximum antibacterial activity (MIC < 0.65 mu g/mL) almost equivalent to that of standards used, against all bacterial strains under study. Docking results on representative molecules with DNA topoisomerases I and II revealed the possible mode of action of these molecules.",0
"The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of electrolyzed oxidizing (ED) water in reducing natural microbiota on radish seed and sprout during seed soaking and sprouting. EO water with different available chlorine concentrations (ACC, 15, 20, 28, 33 and 40 mg/L) and different pH (2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5) were used to soak radish seeds for 12 h and the surviving population of total aerobic bacteria, yeast and mold, and germination rate were determined. On the other hand, EO water with ACC of 30 and 50 mg/L was applied to spray sprouts during seed sprouting and the antimicrobial efficacy of EO water, as well as length, gross weight and dry weight of sprout were evaluated. The results showed that the population of natural microbiota decreased with increasing ACC of EO water, while no significant difference was observed among EO waters with different pH levels that were applied while soaking the seeds. EO water with higher ACC and lower pH slightly reduced the germination percentage of radish seed during seed soaking. EO waters with ACC of 30 and 50 mg/L sprayed during seed sprouting resulted in 1.39 and 1.58 log reductions of total aerobic bacteria, yeast and mold, respectively, and improved the length, gross weight and dry weight of the sprouts. Therefore, EO water with low ACC and near neutral pH could be used to soak seeds and water sprouts throughout seed germination and sprouting to control the population of natural microbiota on seeds and sprouts.

"Several studies have exposed the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Curcuma longa, widely used in food industry as a colorant, among other functions. This study was implemented to examine the antimicrobial activity of Curcuma longa leaves against six Bacillus species. Antimicrobial activities of three different extracts of Curcuma longa leaves on Bacillus species were tested on the basis of disk diffusion method and the zone of inhibition was measured. The ethanol extract of the plant leaf produced maximum zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus Xb21 (12.50 mm) followed by Paenibacillus sp. BF38 (11.10 mm), Bacillus simplex Xb17 (10.40 mm), Bacillus megaterium Hb42 (9.15 mm), Paenibacillus sp. L32 (8.00 mm) with the exception of Terribacillus sp. 3 LF showed resistance, whereas the ethyl acetate and hexane extracts did not exhibit against all the tested bacteria. The chloroform extract of Curcuma longa leaves exhibited against only Bacillus simplex Xb17 (14.45 mm) and Paenibacillus sp. BF38 (12.25 mm). The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) values of ethanol extract against tested bacteria were almost 15.625 g/10 l. The results suggest that the ethanol extract of Curcuma longa leaves could be considered as potentially effective antimicrobial agents against tested Bacillus species.",0
"The betaproteobacterium Laribacter hongkongensis is associated with invasive bacteremic infections and gastroenteritis. Its genome contains two adjacent arc gene cassettes (arc1 and arc2) under independent transcriptional control, which are essential for acid resistance. Laribacter hongkongensis also encodes duplicate copies of the argA and argB genes from the arginine biosynthesis pathway. We show that arginine enhances the transcription of arcA2 but suppresses arcA1 expression. We demonstrate that ArgR acts as a transcriptional regulator of the two arc operons through binding to ARG operator sites (ARG boxes). Upon temperature shift from 20 degrees C to 37 degrees C, arcA1 transcription is upregulated while arcA2, argA2, argB2 and argG are downregulated. The transcription of arcA1 and arcA2 are augmented under anaerobic and acidic conditions. The transcription levels of argA1, argA2, argB1, argB2 and argG are significantly increased under anaerobic and acidic conditions but are repressed by the addition of arginine. Deletion of argR significantly decreases bacterial survival in macrophages, while expression of both arc operons, argR and all five of the anabolic arg genes increases 8h post-infection. Our results show that arginine catabolism in L.hongkongensis is finely regulated by controlling the transcription of two arc operons, whereas arginine anabolism is controlled by two copies of argA and argB.",0
"N-epsilon-Acetylation of lysine residues represents a pivotal post-translational modification used by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes to modulate diverse biological processes. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, one of the most formidable public health threats. Many aspects of the biology of M. tuberculosis remain elusive, in particular the extent and function of N-epsilon-lysine acetylation. With a combination of anti-acetyllysine antibody-based immunoaffinity enrichment with high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified 1128 acetylation sites on 658 acetylated M. tuberculosis proteins. GO analysis of the acetylome showed that acetylated proteins are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including metabolism and protein synthesis. Six types of acetylated peptide sequence motif were revealed from the acetylome. Twenty lysine-acetylated proteins showed homology with acetylated proteins previously identified from Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces roseosporus, with several acetylation sites highly conserved among four or five bacteria, suggesting that acetylated proteins are more conserved. Notably, several proteins including isocitrate lyase involved in the persistence, virulence and antibiotic resistance are acetylated, and site-directed mutagenesis of isocitrate lyase acetylation site to glutamine led to a decrease of the enzyme activity, indicating major roles of KAc in these proteins engaged cellular processes. Our data firstly provides a global survey of M. tuberculosis acetylation, and implicates extensive regulatory role of acetylation in this pathogen. This may serve as an important basis to address the roles of lysine acetylation in M. tuberculosis metabolism, persistence and virulence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Chemical examination of the ethyl acetate extract from the fermentation broth of the marine-derived bacterium Bacillus licheniformis resulted in the isolation of two new glycolipids, ieodoglucomide C (1) and ieodoglycolipid (2). The structural characterization of 1 and 2 was achieved by extensive spectroscopic evidence, including 2D NMR experiments. A combination of chemical derivatization techniques followed by NMR studies, LC-MS data analysis and a literature review was deployed for the establishment of the stereo-configurations of 1 and 2. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited good antibiotic properties against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 mu M. Furthermore, the antifungal activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated against plant pathogenic fungi Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea and Colletotrichum acutatum as well as the human pathogen Candida albicans. Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited the mycelial growth of these pathogens with MIC values of 0.03-0.05 mu M, revealing that these compounds are good candidates for the development of new fungicides.",1
"In this study, the pathogenicity of GFP tagged Vibrio parahaemolyticus Dahv2 and the protective effect of the probiotic strain, Bacillus licheniformis Dahb1was studied on the Asian catfish, Pangasius hypophthalmus. The experiment was carried out for 24 days with three groups and one group served as the control (without treatment). In the first group, P. hypophthalmus was orally infected with 1 mL of GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 at two different doses (10(5) and 10(7) cfu mL(-1)). In the second group, P. hypophthalmus was orally administrated with 1 ml of the probiotic B. licheniformis Dahb1 at two different doses (10(5) and 10(7) cfu mL(-1)). In the third group, P. hypophthalmus was orally infected first with 1 mL of GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 followed by the administration of 1 mL of B. licheniformis Dahbl (combined treatment) at two different doses (10(5) and 10(7) cfu mL(-1)). The growth, immune (myeloperoxidase, respiratory burst, natural complement haemolytic and lysozyme activity) and antioxidant (glutathione-S-transferase, reduced glutathione and total glutathione) responses of P. hypophthalmus were reduced after post infection of GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 compared to control. However, after administration with the probiotic B. licheniformis Dahb1 at 10(5) cfu P. hypophthalmus showed significant increase in the growth, immune and antioxidant responses compared to 10(7) cfu mL(-1). On the otherhand, the growth, immune and antioxidant responses of P. hypophthalmus infected and administrated with combined GFP tagged Vibrio + Bacillus at 10(5) cfu mL(-1) were relatively higher than that of GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 and control groups but lower than that of probiotic B. licheniformis Dahb1 groups. The results of the present study conclude that the probiotic B. licheniformis Dahb1 at 10(5) cfu mL(-1) has the potential to protect the P. hypophthalmus against V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 infection by enhancing the growth, immune and antioxidant responses. The probiotic B. licheniformis Dahb1 would be effectively used in the treatment of aquatic diseases for improvement of aquaculture industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Human APOBEC3A (A3A) cytidine deaminase is a host enzyme that can introduce mutations into chromosomal DNA. As APOBEC3B (A3B) encodes a C-terminal catalytic domain similar to 91% identical to A3A, we examined its genotoxic potential as well as that of a highly prevalent chimaeric A3A-A3B deletion allele (Delta A3B), which is linked to a higher odds ratio of developing breast, ovarian and liver cancer. Interestingly, breast cancer genomes from Delta A3B(-/-) patients show a higher overall mutation burden. Here it is shown that germline A3B can hypermutate nuclear DNA, albeit less efficiently than A3A. Chimaeric A3A mRNA resulting from Delta A3B was more stable, resulting in higher intracellular A3A levels and greater DNA damage. The cancer burden implied by the higher A3A levels could be considerable given the high penetration of the Delta A3B allele in South East Asia.",0
"2-Aminobenzimidazole was diazotized and made to react with active methylene compounds viz: ethylcyanoacetate and malanonitrile. The ligands [IIIa and IIIb] were isolated, characterized, and then condensed with Ni(II) chloride, Cu(II) chloride, and Ag(I) nitrate. The ligands and complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, IR, H-1 NMR, ESR, UV-Visible spectral techniques, and along with thermal studies. The antimicrobial activity of the ligands [IIIa (C12H11N5O2) and IIIb (C10H6N6)] and their metal complexes [IVa-IVf] against bacterial strains and fungal strains were investigated. The antimicrobial activity of the above metals and the ligands were discussed.",0
"Enrofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone derivative used for treating urinary tract, respiratory and skin infections in animals. However, low solubility and low bioavailability prevented it from using on humans. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is an inert, non toxic polymer with excellent hydrophilic properties, besides it can enhance bioavailability by forming drug polymer conjugates. With the aim of increasing solubility and bioavailability, enrofloxacin thin films were prepared using PVP as a polymer matrix. The obtained oral thin films exhibited excellent uniformity and mechanical properties. Swelling properties of the oral thin films revealed that the water uptake was enhanced by 21%. The surface pH has been found to be 6.8 +/- 0.1 indicating that these films will not cause any irritation to oral mucosa. FTIR data of the oral thin films indicated physical interaction between drug and polymer. SEM analysis revealed uniform distribution of drug in polymer matrix. In vitro drug release profiles showed enhanced release profiles (which are also pH dependant) for thin films compared to pure drug. Antibacterial activity was found to be dose dependent and maximum susceptibility was found on Klebsiella pneumonia making this preparation more suitable for respiratory infections.

"Capparis decidua L. (family Capparaceae) is widely used in Sudan for curing variety of ailments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial, antigiardial, antimalarial, antioxidant activities and cytotoxicity of plant extracts from the twigs of C. decidua. Extracts were evaluated for their effectiveness against four bacterial strains including both Gram-positive ( Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria as well as fungal species ( Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) using disc diffusion method. Antibacterial effects of twigs extracts showed different degrees of inhibition profiles against tested bacteria. The ethyl acetate extract showed the highest activity against S. aureus (21 mm), B. subtilis (20 mm) and P. pneumoniae (18 mm) while the n-butanol extract displayed best inhibition against P. pneumoniae (18 mm) and E. coli (16 mm). All extracts showed high antifungal activity against A. niger and C. albicans with inhibition zone ranged from 17 to 22 mm. Antimalarial activity assay showed that all extracts were less potent than chloroquine drug against P. falciparum. Antigiardial activity was determined against Giardia lamblia where the chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts possessed potent antigiardial activity after 24 h at concentration 500 g/ml with respectively 91 and 89% mortality comparable to that exhibited by metronidazole drug (89%). The antioxidant potential of extracts was determined on the basis of their scavenging activity of the stable 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). The petroleum ether and n-butanol extracts showed moderate DPPH scavenging activity, while the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts showed low activity. All extracts were inactive in the FRAP assay. All extracts were nontoxic against brine shrimps and vero cell lines suggesting that they were safe for traditional use.",0
"BACKGROUND: Dental unit water (DUW) could be contaminated by human pathogens coming from biological fluids penetrated during patient treatment and by opportunistic pathogens detached from aquatic biofilm. These microorganisms could be spread to following patients. We tested the disinfectant activity of hydrogen peroxide and monovalent silver ions (H(2)O(2)-Ag(+)) into DUW artificially contaminated with freshly isolated pathogens. METHODS: The tested microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium chelonae, non-pathogenic Bacillus clausii spores. Bacterial suspensions were inoculated into the waterlines of pre-sterilized dental turbines. The test-turbines were connected to DUW and contaminated water was treated for 10 minutes with H(2)O(2)-Ag(+)-based disinfectant (H(2)O(2) 3% v/v, Ag(+) 0.001% w/v). The control-turbines were left untreated. Turbines were washed with sterile hard water used to assess the residual bacterial loads (expressed in colony forming units -cfu). Each strain was tested five times and the mean log loads were assessed. Following the European Standardization Committee, the disinfectant activity was evaluated as mean log load reduction, that is, the difference between the mean log load detected on the control-turbines and the mean log load detected on the test-turbines. RESULTS: Mean bacterial loads detected on the control-turbines ranged between 105-107 cfu. The mean log load reductions resulted 7.5 log cfu for S. aureus, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, 6.3 for C. albicans, 5.4 for L. pneumophila, 5.3 for M. chelonae, 2.9 for B. clausii spores. CONCLUSIONS: DUW disinfection with H(2)O(2)-Ag(+) could help minimize the risk that planktonic pathogens are spread to patients during dental treatment.",0

"Two Pseudomonas strains, identified as closely related to Pseudomonas tolaasii, were isolated from milk of a farm with frequent false-positive Delvotest results for screening putative antibiotic residues in raw milk executed as part of the regulatory quality programme. Growth at 5 to 7 degrees C of these isolates in milk resulted in high lipolysis and the production of bacterial inhibitors. The two main bacterial inhibitors have a molecular weight of 1168.7 and 1140.7 Da respectively, are heat-tolerant and inhibit Geobacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis, the test strain of most of the commercially available microbiological inhibitor tests for screening of antibiotic residues in milk. Furthermore, these bacterial inhibitors show antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis and also interfere negatively with yoghurt production. Following their isolation and purification with RP-HPLC, the inhibitors were identified by NMR analysis as cyclic lipodepsipeptides of the viscosin group. Our findings bring to light a new challenge for quality control in the dairy industry. By prolonging the refrigerated storage of raw milk, the keeping quality of milk is influenced by growth and metabolic activities of psychrotrophic bacteria such as pseudomonads. Besides an increased risk of possible spoilage of long shelf-life milk, the production at low temperature of natural bacterial inhibitors may also result in false-positive results for antibiotic residue screening tests based on microbial inhibitor assays thus leading to undue production loss.",0
"Compost teas are fermented aqueous extracts of composted materials that are used for their ability to control plant pathogens. It had been previously reported that this inhibition by compost teas is at least partially attributed to the presence of live microorganisms. In this study, the inhibitory effects of bacteria from suppressive compost tea were examined against mycelial growth of Alternaria solani and Botrytis cinerea as well as disease development on tomato fruit. Isolation of antifungal extracts and identification of antifungal compounds from the most effective bacterial strains were also performed. Results showed that the bacteria had the ability to greatly inhibit the mycelial growth of B. cinerea and/or A. solani by up to 70%. The two most effective isolates, Brevibacterium linens (IC 10) and Bacillus subtilis, showed that co-application of bacterial antagonists (5 x 10(5) or 5 x 10(6) cells) with the pathogens on tomato fruit demonstrated inhibition of the development of B. cinerea lesions by up to 61%. A preventive application of the bacteria (5 x 10(5) or 5 x 10(6) cells) was more effective than co-application, allowing a significant reduction in lesions of A. solani and improving efficacy of low bacterial concentrations in reducing B. cinerea lesions. A combined B. linens/B. subtilis treatment was generally more inhibitory than either bacterium alone indicating possible synergistic effects. Antifungal compounds, including surfactins, were found in the bacterial extracts indicating that antibiosis is a main mechanism of action. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"The synthesis of a novel series of substituted 5-(aminomethylene)thiazolidine-2,4-diones was achieved using a wide range of heterocyclic models derived from eight drug-like molecules. The primary aim of this study was to combine medicinally known, biologically active molecules bearing a 2A degrees amine functionality, such as terbinafine, fluoxetine, atomoxetine, cetirizine, risperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, and clopidogrel, with a thiazolidinedione ring via an amino-methylene linker. By targeting this synergistic approach to compounds with skeletal, functional, and stereochemical diversity, we have developed a simple synthetic concept to enrich the thiazolidinedione collection with various biological activities. The biological activities of the newly synthesized 5-(aminomethylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives were explored. All compounds were found to have antibacterial activity, with compounds bearing pyridine or piperazine moieties showing good to excellent antibacterial activity. Compounds with piperazine moieties were also found to show good antifungal activity, whereas none of the synthesized compounds showed high cytotoxic activity.",0
"The Bacillus pumilus 15.1 strain, a recently described entomopathogenic strain active against Ceratitis capitata, contains at least two extrachromosomal elements, pBp15.15 and pBp15.1B. Given that B. pumilus is not a typical entomopathogenic bacterium, the acquisition of this extrachromosomal DNA may explain why B. pumilus 15.1 is toxic to an insect. One of the plasmids present in the strain, the pBp15.15 plasmid, was sub-cloned, sequenced and analyzed using bioinformatics to identify any potential virulence factor. The pBp15.15 plasmid was found to be 7785 bp in size with a GC content of 35.7% and 11 putative ORFs. A replication module typical of a small rolling circle plasmid and a sensing and regulatory system specific for plasmids was found in pBp15.15. Additionally, we demonstrated the existence of ssDNA in plasmid preparations suggesting that pBp15.15 replicates by the small rolling circle mechanism. A gene cluster present in plasmid pPZZ84 from a distantly isolated B. pumilus strain was also present in pBp15.15. The plasmid copy number of pBp15.15 in exponentially growing B. pumilus cells was determined to be 33 copies per chromosome. After an extensive plasmid characterization, no known virulence factor was found so a search in the other extrachromosomal elements of the bacteria is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Production of beta-lactamases of one of four molecular classes (A, B, C and D) is the major mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactams, the largest class of antibiotics, which have saved countless lives since their inception 70 years ago. Although several hundred efficient class D enzymes have been identified in Gram-negative pathogens over the last four decades, none have been reported in Gram-positive bacteria. Here we demonstrate that efficient class D. beta-lactamases capable of hydrolyzing a wide array of beta-lactam substrates are widely disseminated in various species of environmental Gram-positive organisms. Class D enzymes of Gram-positive bacteria have a distinct structural architecture and employ a unique substrate-binding mode that is quite different from that of all currently known class A, C and D. beta-lactamases. These enzymes thus constitute a previously unknown reservoir of novel antibiotic-resistance enzymes.",1
"The combined effect of heat treatment and electro-activated solution (EAS) on the heat resistance of spores of Clostridium sporogenes and Geobacillus stearothermophilus was assessed under various heating and exposure time combinations. The acid and neutral EAS showed the highest inhibitory activity, indicating that these solutions may be considered as strong sporicidal disinfectants. These EAS were able to cause a reduction of >= 6 log of spores of C sporogenes at 60 degrees C in only 1 min of exposition. For G. stearothermophilus spores, a reduction of 4.5 log was observed at 60 degrees C in 1 min, while in 5 min, >= 7 log CFU/ml reduction was observed. Inoculated puree of pea and corn were used as a food matrix for the determination of the heat resistance of these spores during the treatments in glass capillaries. The inactivation kinetics of the spores was studied in an oil bath. Combined treatment by EAS and temperature demonstrated a significant decrease in the heat resistance of C. sporogenes. The D-100 degrees C in pea puree with NaCl solution was 66.86 min while with acid and neutral EAS it was reduced down to 3.97 and 2.19 min, respectively. The spore of G. stearothermophilus displayed higher heat resistance as confirmed by other similar studies. Its D-130 degrees C in pea puree showed a decrease from 1.45 min in NaCl solution down to 1.30 and 0.93 mm for acid and neutral EAS, respectively. The differences between the spores of these species are attributable to their different sensitivities with respect to pH, Redox potential and oxygen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Ethnopharmacogical relevance: Bacterial infection is one of the main secondary infections caused by snakebite. The 88 plant species investigated in this study have been used as folk remedies for treatment of snakebite, and it is therefore the aim of this study to investigate whether the plants contain compounds with bacterial growth inhibition. Materials and methods: The water and ethanol extracts of 88 plant species were screened at 200 mu g/mL against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for their antibacterial activity by micro-broth dilution assay. The most active extracts were fractionated into microplates using analytical-scale RP-HPLC, and subsequently growth inhibition was assessed for each well. The biochromatograms constructed from these assays were used to identify compounds responsible for antibacterial activity. The structures of five compounds were elucidated by HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR. Results: Crude extracts of Boehmeria nivea, Colocasia esculenta, Fagopyrum cymosum, Glochidion puberum, Melastoma dodecandrum, Polygonum bistorta, Polygonum cuspidatum and Sanguisorba officinalis showed MIC values below 200 mu g/mL against either Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The biochromatograms demonstrated that tannins play a main role for the bacterial growth inhibition observed for all above-mentioned plants except for Polygonum cuspidatum. Furthermore, the high-resolution bacterial growth inhibition profiling combined with HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR allowed fast identification of three non-tannin active compounds, i.e., piceid, resveratrol and emodin from ethanol extract of Polygonum cuspidatum. Conclusion: The high-resolution bacterial growth inhibition profiling allowed fast pinpointing of constituents responsible for the bioactivity, e.g., either showing tannins being the main bacterial growth inhibitors as observed for the majority of the active plants, or combined with HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR for fast structural identification of non-tannin constituents correlated with antibacterial activity.

"We characterized two newly isolated myoviruses, Bp8p-C and Bp8p-T, infecting the ginger rhizome rot disease pathogen Bacillus pumilus GR8. The plaque of Bp8p-T exhibited a clear center with a turbid rim, suggesting that Bp8p-T could transform into latent phage. Lysogeny assays showed that both the two phages could form latent states, while Bp8p-T could form latent phage at a higher frequency and stability than Bp8p-C. The genomes of Bp8p-C and Bp8p-T were 151,417 and 151,419 bp, respectively; both encoded 212 putative proteins, and only differed by three nucleotides. Moreover, owing to this difference, Bp8p-C encoded a truncated, putative actin-like plasmid segregation protein Gp27-C. Functional analysis of protein Gp27 showed that Gp27-T encoded by Bp8p-T exhibited higher ATPase activity and assembly ability than Gp27-C. The results indicate that the difference in Gp27 affected the phage lysogenic ability. Structural proteome analysis of Bp8p-C virion resulted in the identification of 14 structural proteins, among which a pectin lyase-like protein, a putative poly-gamma-glutamate hydrolase, and three proteins with unknown function, were firstly identified as components of the phage virion. Both phages exhibited specific lytic ability to the host strain GR8. Bp8p-C showed better control effect on the pathogen in ginger rhizome slices than Bp8p-T, suggesting that Bp8p-C has a potential application in bio-control of ginger rhizome rot disease.",1
"The bacterial spore can rapidly convert from a dormant to a fully active cell. Here we study this remarkable cellular transition in Bacillus subtilis and reveal the identity of the newly synthesized proteins throughout spore revival. Our analysis uncovers a highly ordered developmental program that correlates with the spore morphological changes and reveals the spatial and temporal molecular events fundamental to reconstruct a cell. As opposed to current knowledge, we found that translation takes place during the earliest revival event, termed germination, a process hitherto considered to occur without the need for any macromolecule synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that translation is required for execution of germination and relies on the bona fide translational factors RpmE and Tig. Our study sheds light on the spore revival process and on the vital building blocks underlying cellular awakening, thereby paving the way for designing new antimicrobial agents to eradicate spore-forming pathogens.",0
"Finding new antimicrobial activities by functional metagenomics has been shown to depend on the heterologous host used to express the foreign DNA. Therefore, efforts are devoted to developing new tools for constructing metagenomic libraries in shuttle vectors replicatable in phylogenetically distinct hosts. Here we evaluated the use of the Escherichia coli-Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pHT01 to construct a forest-soil metagenomic library. This library was screened in both hosts for antimicrobial activities against four opportunistic bacteria: Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Micrococcus luteus. A new antibacterial activity against B. cereus was found upon screening in B. subtilis. The new antimicrobial agent, sensitive to proteinase K, was not active when the corresponding DNA fragment was expressed in E. coli. Our results validate the use of pHT01 as a shuttle vector and B. subtilis as a host to isolate new activities by functional metagenomics.",0
"Antimicrobial evaluation of methanol extract of Sarcochlamys pulcherrima leaf and its hexane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and water fractions against 31 strains of microorganisms, using agar well, agar disc diffusion, and broth microdilution methods, revealed the activity of methanol extract against Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus and Escheracia coli (zone of inhibition: 21-40 mm, 200 mg/mL, and MIC: 6.25-50 mg/mL). All fractions also displayed antimicrobial activity (5-20 mg/mL), indeed ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions showed better activity (MIC: 0.156 to 2.5 mg/mL). C. albicans was most sensitive to n-butanol fraction (15 mm, 2.5 mg/mL). Ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions were more active against T. mentagrophytes (12 mm at 1.25 mg/mL) and S. aureus (ethyl acetate-16 mm, n-butanol-14 mm at 0.625 mg/mL). E. coli was inhibited by n-butanol fraction (13 mm at 2.5 mg/mL). Further, n-butanol fraction (400 mu g/disc) exhibited promising activity against 14 bacteria, 2 dermatophytes and 2 yeasts strains.",0
"Endophytic bacterial isolate Bacillus subtilis EPCO16 which inhibited the mycelial growth (46.0%) of tomato vascular wilt pathogen Fusariutn oxy,sportan f.sp. lycopersici was selected for assessing its secondary metabolites. Polymerase chain reaction was carried out to screen isolate EPCO16 for genes involved in biosynthesis of antibiotics. Amplicons of the expected sizes were detected for NC, ItuD, BinyA, Bad), BacAB, and FenD involved in the biosynthesis of Iturin, Bacillomycin. Bacilysin and Fengycin. respectively. The identity of these genes was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the amplicons. lturin and surfactin were detected in culture filtrates from isolate EPCO16 by thin layer chromatography. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy analysis revealed the presence of antifungal volatile compounds from isolate EPCO16. Seed treatment, seedling dip and soil application of B. subtilis EPCO16 in liquid formulation upon challenge inoculated with F. oxy.sportnn f. sp. lyeopersici resulted in lower disease incidence (68.4% reduction) with increased plant growth and fruit yield of tomato relative to the control.",0
"New tridentate ligand 3-amino-4-{1,5-dimethy1-342-(5-methyl-1H-indo1-3-y1)-ethylimino]-2pheny1 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-ylazo}-phenol L was synthesized from the reaction of 1,5-dimethy1-342-(5methy1-1H-indo1-3-y1)-ethylimino]-2-pheny1-2,3-dihydr o-1H-pyrazol-4-ylamine and 3.4-amino phenol. A complexes of these ligand INKII)(L)(H20) Cl]Cl, [pt(IV)(L)C13]Cl and [M(II)(L)ClICI (M = Pd (II), Zn (II), Cd (II) and Hg (II) were synthesized. The complexes were characterized by spectroscopic methods and magnetic moment measurements, elemental analysis, metal content, Chloride containing and conductance. These studies revealed octahedral geometries for the Ni (II), pt (IV) complexes, square planar for Pd (II) complex and tetrahedral for the Zn (II), Cd(II) and Hg (II) complexes. The study of complexes formation via molar ratio and job method in DMF solution has been investigated and results were consistent to those found in the solid complexes with a ratio of (M:L) as (1:1). The thermodynamic parameters, such as AE, AS* AG. and K are calculated from the TGA curve using Coats Redfern method. Hyper Chem-8 program has been used to predict structural geometries of compounds in gas phase. The synthesized ligand and its metal complexes were screened for their biological activity against bacterial species, two Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

"We develop an optical imaging technique for spatially and temporally tracking biofilm growth and the distribution of the main phenotypes of a Bacillus subtilis strain with a triple-fluorescent reporter for motility, matrix production, and sporulation. We develop a calibration procedure for determining the biofilm thickness from the transmission images, which is based on Beer-Lambert's law and involves cross-sectioning of biofilms. To obtain the phenotype distribution, we assume a linear relationship between the number of cells and their fluorescence and determine the best combination of calibration coefficients that matches the total number of cells for all three phenotypes and with the total number of cells from the transmission images. Based on this analysis, we resolve the composition of the biofilm in terms of motile, matrix-producing, sporulating cells and low-fluorescent materials which includes matrix and cells that are dead or have low fluorescent gene expression. We take advantage of the circular growth to make kymograph plots of all three phenotypes and the dominant phenotype in terms of radial distance and time. To visualize the nonlocal character of biofilm growth, we also make kymographs using the local colonization time. Our technique is suitable for real-time, noninvasive, quantitative studies of the growth and phenotype distribution of biofilms which are either exposed to different conditions such as biocides, nutrient depletion, dehydration, or waste accumulation.",0
"Methanol extract of thirty-eight seaweeds samples were first screened against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051) and -negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Pseudomonas aerugenosa ATCC 9027) bacteria. Laurencia papillosa (Ceramiales, Rhodomelaceae, Rhodophyta) gave maximum antimicrobial activity against these bacteria. It was finally tested against four clinical Gram-negative isolates (E. coli, P. aerugenosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexineri) and exhibited antibacterial activity. The extract was fractionated by column chromatography and the active fraction was identified as a cholesterol derivative, 24-propylidene cholest-5-en-3 beta-ol using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and FT-IR spectroscopic analysis also supported the structure of the compound. The minimum inhibitory concentration ranged from 1.2 to 1.7 mu g/mL (IC50) against clinical isolates. This is the first report of antibacterial activity of this cholesterol derivative. This compound could be exploited as potential lead molecule against broad spectrum drug development. The results also affirm the potential of seaweeds as an important natural source of antimicrobial compounds for pharmaceutical industries. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",0
"In order to identify Bacillus strains with new toxin combinations, 26 bacterial isolate belonging to Bacillus sp. were isolated from warehouses in Trabzon. Firstly, colonial and cellular characteristics, then, physiological features and biochemical properties of these isolates were analyzed by the light microscopy, manual tests and API kit, respectively. For the molecular characterization, 16S rDNA sequence and cry gene contents were detected. As a consequence of characterization, the isolates were identified as Bacillus thuringiensis, B. pumilus, B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, B. atrophaeus, B. megaterium and Lysinibacillus sphaericus. It was also recorded that the isolates Bg5 have a cry1 gene, B2, B3 and N6 have a cry3 gene. The toxic effects of the isolates were determined by the bioassay using larvae of Plodi ainterpunctella (Indianmeal moth), Ephestia kuehniella (Mediterranean flour moth) and adults of Sitophilus granarius (Wheat weevil). As a results of the bioassay, the highest insecticidal effects were 100% with Bg5 (Bacillus thuringiensis) against the larvae of P. interpunctella and 63,3% with B4 (B. subtilis) against the adult of S. granarius. Especially, Bg5 has the highest insecticidal effect may be valuable as a microbial control agent for lepidopteran warehouse pests.",0
"The utilization of probiotic bacteria have been widely tested and applied in intestinal microflora modulation, through competitive exclusion of the pathogenic bacteria. Aeromonas hydrophila is a gram-negative bacterium, responsible for fish outbreaks in farms around the world, and is one of the major loss causes for neotropical fish farmers. 660 pacus (67 +/- 7 g) were distributed in 20 tanks (n =33), constituting five groups (four tanks for each treatment): four groups were fed with different levels (2, 4, 8 and 16 g kg(-1)) of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis (1:1, 10(8) CFU g(-1)), and the fifth group was fed with a control diet (without probiotic). Pacus fed with probiotic showed increment in the ROS production associated to elevated neutrophil and monocyte counts and increased phagocytic activity without affecting the growth parameters. Probiotic fed fish presented higher survival rates, subjected to an i.p. challenge with 10(8) CFU mL(-1) of A. hydrophila. The results demonstrated a dose response effect and the ideal level of the probiotic (Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis, 1:1, 108 CFU g(-1)) in P. mesopotamicus diets was around 8 g kg(-1), as the highest survival rates and immunological responses were found in groups of fish fed with this diet. In addition, too much probiotic should be avoided, as pacus fed diet with 16 g kg(-1) showed partial suppression of these responses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"A chlorpyrifos-degrading bacterium, Klebsiella sp. CPK, which can biodegrade chlorpyrifos and transform it into 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, was isolated by the enrichment culture technique. A classic stringent response triggered by chlorpyrifos stress was identified through the detection of (p)ppGpp accumulation in this strain. Sequence analysis of the (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA in Kiebsiella sp. CPK showed that it only had (p)ppGpp synthetase activity. Compared to its parent, the Delta relA strain was more sensitive to several stress conditions, such as high salt, low pH values and a high concentration of chlorpyrifos. In addition, growth curves and semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that chlorpyrifos stress affected the growth and relA expression. Together, these results indicated that chlorpyrifos could mount a stringent response in the Klebsiella sp. CPK strain, and relA expression modulated the response of the Klebsiella sp. CPK strain to chlorpyrifos stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"[Objective] To search for structurally novel and biologically active compounds from the secondary metabolites of gorgonian-derived actinomyces. [Methods] Strains of actinomyces with antimicrobial activities were screened by biological methods. Then, those active strains were cultured under different conditions to obtain crude extracts. Subsequently, the chemical diversities of the extracts were investigated by reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC), while the bioactivities of the extracts were evaluated by antifoulingand antibacterial assays. A target strain Streptomyces sp. SCSGAA0009 was selected to further study by large-scale fermentationon modified ISP2 medium. The compounds were isolated by column chromatography over silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and semipreparative HPLC, and their structures were determinated by spectroscopic analysis. [Results] The target strain was identified as actinomyces, Streptomyces sp. SCSGAA0009. A new alkaloid N-(2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl) propionamide (1) and a known compound phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (2) were purified from the culture broth. Compound 2 showed moderate antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudoaltermonas piscida, and exhibited strong antilarval settlement activity towards Bugula neritina larva.

"A bacteriocin-producing strain (9,000 AU/ml) was isolated from the rhizosphere of Algerian healthy plants Ononis angustissima Lam. and identified as Bacillus clausii strain GM17. The bacteriocin, called Bac-GM17, was purified from the culture supernatant after heat treatment, ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-50 chromatography and Mono Q fast-performance liquid chromatography (FPLC). Based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis, the purified Bac-GM17 is a monomer protein with a molecular mass of 5,158.11 Da. The N-terminal sequencing allowed for the straightforward identification of its first 20 residues, which were of pure bacteriocin. It also revealed that this bacteriocin contained a unique sequence, namely DWTCSKWSCLVCDDCSVELT, which suggests the identification of a novel compound. Bac-GM17 was extremely heat stable (20 min at 120 A degrees C) and was stable within the pH range (3-9). It was found to be resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin, pepsin, papain, pronase E, and proteinase K. It was also noted to display a bactericidal mode of action against Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 and a fungistatic mode of action against Candida tropicalis R2 CIP203.",0
"Antibacterial compounds typically act by directly inhibiting essential bacterial enzyme activities. Although this general mechanism of action has fueled traditional antibiotic discovery efforts for decades, new antibiotic development has not kept pace with the emergence of drug resistant bacterial strains. These limitations have severely restricted the therapeutic tools available for treating bacterial infections. Here we test an alternative antibacterial lead-compound identification strategy in which essential protein-protein interactions are targeted rather than enzymatic activities. Bacterial single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs) form conserved protein interaction ""hubs"" that are essential for recruiting many DNA replication, recombination, and repair proteins to SSB/DNA nucleoprotein substrates. Three small molecules that block SSB/protein interactions are shown to have antibacterial activity against diverse bacterial species. Consistent with a model in which the compounds target multiple SSB/protein interactions, treatment of Bacillus subtilis cultures with the compounds leads to rapid inhibition of DNA replication and recombination, and ultimately to cell death. The compounds also have unanticipated effects on protein synthesis that could be due to a previously unknown role for SSB/protein interactions in translation or to off-target effects. Our results highlight the potential of targeting protein-protein interactions, particularly those that mediate genome maintenance, as a powerful approach for identifying new antibacterial compounds.",0
"Context: Amanita ovoidea (Bull.) Link (Amanitaceae) is a well-known species due to its pleasant aroma and flavor since ancient times in the worldwide. This species is also known in Turkey and people consume it extensively. Objective: To evaluate medicinal importance of A. ovoidea for human health, to explain the effect of mushroom extracts on bacterial DNA, and to find preventive role on bacterial disease. Materials and methods: Chloroform, acetone, and methanol extracts of A. ovoidea were tested for the antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive bacteria, five Gram-negative bacteria, and yeast using a micro-dilution method. In addition, DNA binding, DNA cleavage activity, and restriction enzyme digestion of the methanol extract of A. ovoidea were examined at different concentrations (40.000-78.125 mu g/mL). Results: The highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value observed against the test micro-organisms was with the chloroform extract (MIC 19.5 mg/mL concentration) against Candida albicans. Other highest antimicrobial effects observed against the test micro-organisms were with the methanol extracts against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella enteritidis (MICs, 78 mu g/mL concentrations). All concentrations reduced the mobility of plasmid DNA. BamHI and HindIII targeted specially to supercoils and cut them. Amanita ovoidea extract prevented cutting with HindIII by binding especially to the AA region in open circular DNA. Discussion and conclusion: Present results demonstrated that A. ovoidea has excellent antimicrobial and antifungal activities by its DNA interaction activity on pBR322.",0
"Unlike bigger and more advanced animals, Caenorhabditis elegans does not generate NO, yet it was recently found that NO produced by chemical or biological sources exerts profound effects in that animal, leading to increased life span and thermotolerance. The biological source was Bacillus subtilis, a natural food for C. elegans. Yet once in the cell, NO might react with superoxide, leading to the production of the potentially toxic peroxynitrite. In this paper, a number of paradoxes that are involved in that situation are discussed. It is also argued that their solution might lead to a sizeable advancement of our knowledge of what constitutes oxidative stress and what role oxidative stress plays in the development of pathological processes and aging.

"Gene regulation accomplished by alternative folding of an mRNA is a widely used mechanism. Classical examples are the various transcriptional attenuation mechanisms that employ, for example, leader peptide translation, or binding of a modified protein, an uncharged tRNA or an antisense RNA to the 5' untranslated region of an mRNA. With the discovery of transcriptional and translational riboswitches, it became clear that small metabolites or even metal ions can also alter RNA secondary structures and, hence, gene expression. In addition, biophysical factors like temperature can affect RNA folding, as exemplified by RNA thermometers. We have investigated in detail the type I toxin-antitoxin system bsrG/SR4 from Bacillus subtilis. The antitoxin SR4 is a cis-encoded regulatory RNA that neutralizes BsrG toxin action. SR4 prevents toxin expression by promoting degradation of the toxin mRNA and inhibiting its translation. In addition, upon temperature shock the amount of toxin mRNA decreases significantly. Here, we demonstrate that heat shock induces a refolding in the central region of the toxin mRNA that makes it more accessible to degradation by RNases Y and J1. Furthermore, we show that BsrG might play a role at the onset of stationary phase, when the antitoxin SR4 can no longer prevent toxin synthesis.",0
"Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a widely distributed second messenger that appears to be essential in multiple bacterial species, including the Gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. In this study, the only L. monocytogenes diadenylate cyclase gene, dacA, was deleted using a Cre-lox system activated during infection of cultured macrophages. All Delta dacA strains recovered from infected cells harbored one or more suppressor mutations that allowed growth in the absence of c-di-AMP. Suppressor mutations in the synthase domain of the bi-functional (p) ppGpp synthase/ hydrolase led to reduced (p) ppGpplevels. A genetic assay confirmed that dacA was essential in wild-type but not strains lacking all three (p) ppGpp synthases. Further genetic analysis suggested that c-di-AMP was essential because accumulated (p) ppGpp altered GTP concentrations, thereby inactivating the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator CodY. We propose that c-di-AMP is conditionally essential for metabolic changes that occur in growth in rich medium and host cells but not minimal medium.",0
"Understanding network topology through embracing the global dynamical regulation of genes in an active state space rather than traditional one-gene-one trait approach facilitates the rational drug development process. Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, has glycerophospholipids as abundant molecules present on its surface. Lack of effective clinical solutions to treat pathogens encourages us to carry out systems-level studies that could contribute to the development of an effective therapy. Development of a strategy for identifying drug targets by combined genome-scale metabolic network and essentiality analyses through in silico approaches provides tantalizing opportunity to investigate the role of protein/substrate metabolism. A genome-scale metabolic network model reconstruction represents choline-phosphate cytidyltransferase as the rate limiting enzyme and regulates the rate of phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis. The uptake of choline was regulated by choline concentration, promoting the regulation of phosphocholine synthesis. In Schistosoma, the change in developmental stage could result from the availability of choline, hampering its developmental cycle. There are no structural reports for this protein. In order to inhibit the activity of choline-phosphate cytidyltransferase (CCT), it was modeled by homology modeling using 1COZ as the template from Bacillus subtilis. The transition-state stabilization and catalytic residues were mapped as 'HXGH' and 'RTEGISTT motif. CCT catalyzes the formation of CDP-choline from phosphocholine in which nucleotidyltransferase adds CTP to phosphocholine. The presence of phosphocholine permits the parasite to survive in an immunologically hostile environment. This feature endeavors development of an inhibitor specific for cytidyltransferase in Schistosoma. Flavonolignans were used to inhibit this activity in which hydnowightin showed the highest affinity as compared to miltefosine. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0

"Pomegranate juice (PJ) samples were produced with three different pressing programs: (1) 1.2-4.8 bar for 25 min, (2) 1.2-2.4 bar for 15 min and (3) 1.2-1.8 bar for 5.5 min. Respective juice yields were 39.2%, 33.2% and 27.2%. Effects of pressing pressure-time and yield on total phenolic (TP) content, condensed tannin (CT) content, monomeric anthocyanin (MA) content, antioxidant activity (AOA) and antimicrobial activity (AMA) of the samples were determined. Strong positive linear correlations were found between the pressing pressure with AOA (r = 0.973) and TP content (r = 0.979), while negative logarithmic correlations were found between pressing pressure with the contents of CT (r = -0.778) and MA (r = 0.955). Among 12 microorganisms tested, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were found to be sensitive to juice samples. However, increasing pressing pressure and yield did not lead to a significant change on the AMAs of the juices. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Stem canker and black scurf of potato, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, can be serious diseases causing an economically significant damage. Biocontrol activity of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 11774 against the Rhizoctonia diseases of potato was investigated in this study. Chitinase enzyme was optimally produced by B. subtilis under batch fermentation conditions similar to those of the potato-growing soil. The maximum chitinase was obtained at initial pH 8 and 30 degrees C. In vitro, the lytic action of the B. subtilis chitinase was detected releasing 355 mu g GlcNAc ml(-1) from the cell wall extract of R. solani and suggesting the presence of various chitinase enzymes in the bacterial filtrate. In dual culture test, the antagonistic behavior of B. subtilis resulted in the inhibition of the radial growth of R. solani by 48.1% after 4 days. Moreover, the extracted B. subtilis chitinase reduced the growth of R. solani by 42.3% when incorporated with the PDA plates. Under greenhouse conditions, application of a bacterial suspension of B. subtilis at 109 cell mL(-1) significantly reduced the disease incidence of stem canker and black scurf to 22.3 and 30%, respectively. In addition, it significantly improved some biochemical parameters, growth and tubers yield. Our findings indicate two points; firstly, B. subtilis possesses a good biocontrol activity against Rhizoctonia diseases of potato, secondly, the harmonization and suitability of the soil conditions to the growth and activity of B. subtilis guaranteed a high controlling capacity against the target pathogen.",0

"The purpose of this research was to investigate the toxicity of zearalenone (ZEA) on the growing performance, genital organs, serum hormones and histopathological changes of pre-pubertal female gilts, and to evaluate the efficacy of Bacillus subtilis ANSB01G in alleviating ZEA toxicosis in gilts. Eighteen pre-pubertal female gilts were randomly allocated to three treatments with one replicate per treatment. The gilts were fed following three diets for 24days: the Control group was given a basic diet with normal corn; Treatment 1 (T1) was prepared by substituting corn naturally contaminated with ZEA for all normal corn in the basic diet (with a final concentrations of 238.57 mu gkg(-1) of ZEA); and Treatment 2 (T2) was prepared by mixing the T1 diet with 2kgT(-1) of fermented-dried culture of ANSB01G. The results showed that the presence of ZEA in diets significantly increased the vulva size and reproductive organ weight of the T1 gilts as compared with the Control group, and the addition of ANSB01G to diet naturally contaminated with ZEA obviously ameliorated these symptoms, as was observed in the T2 group. The presence of low doses of ZEA in the T1 diet had no significant effect on the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteotrophic hormone (LH) or serum oestradiol (E2) in the serum of gilts, but the prolactin (PRL) level in group T1 increased significantly. The gilts of the T1 group exhibited conspicuous cell enlargement and fatty degeneration of the corpus uteri, swelling, inflammation and lymphocyte infiltration of liver cells as compared with the Control group. The presence of ANSB01G can alleviate these hyperoestrogenic effects caused by ZEA, maintaining the body of gilt in a normal and healthy status. It is suggested that reproductive organs of gilts are seriously affected even if they are fed a low dose of ZEA in less time, and the addition of B. subtilis ANSB01G can effectively alleviate ZEA toxicosis in gilts.",0
"Bacteria live either as independent planktonic cells or as members of surface-attached communities called biofilms. Motility and biofilm development are mutually exclusive events, and control of the phase of this swim-or-stick' switch involves the ability of the bacterium to sense and respond appropriately to a surface. Cairns etal. (2013) report that the Bacillus subtilis flagellum functions in surface-sensing. Using mutants of B.subtilis that prevent flagellum rotation, they measured the expression and activity of DegU, the response regulator of the two-component DegS-DegU circuit. DegU activity and degU transcription increased when flagellum rotation was prevented, and were dependent on the DegS kinase. Inhibiting flagellar rotation by overexpressing the EpsE flagellar clutch' or addition of anti-flagellin antiserum also increased degU transcription and activity. These results suggest B.subtilis senses restriction of flagellum rotation as the cell nears a surface. Inhibition of the flagellum activates the DegS-DegU circuit to turn on biofilm formation, i.e. the flagellum is acting as a mechanosensor of surfaces. B.subtilis joins an ever-expanding group of bacteria, including species of Vibrio, Proteus and Caulobacter that use the flagellum as a surface sensor.",0
"Marine algae have unique defense strategies against microbial infection. However, their mechanisms of immunity remain to be elucidated and little is known about the similarity of the immune systems of marine algae and terrestrial higher plants. Here, we suggest a possible mechanism underlying algal immunity, which involves hexose oxidase (HOX)-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We examined crude extracts from five different red algal species for their ability to prevent bacterial growth. The extract from one of these algae, Ptilophora subcostata, was particularly active and prevented the growth of gram-positive and -negative bacteria, which was completely inhibited by treatment with catalase. The extract did not affect the growth of either a yeast or a filamentous fungus. We partially purified from P. subcostata an enzyme involved in its antibacterial activity, which shared 50% homology with the HOX of red seaweed Chondrus crispus. In-gel carbohydrate oxidase assays revealed that P. subcostata extract had the ability to produce H2O2 in a hexose-dependent manner and this activity was highest in the presence of galactose. In addition, Bacillus subtilis growth was strongly suppressed near P. subcostata algal fronds on GYP agar plates. These results suggest that HOX plays a role in P. subcostata resistance to bacterial attack by mediating H2O2 production in the marine environment.",0
"Solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was developed for the preconcentration of Cu2+ and Ni2+ before their determination by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Bacillus subtilis-immobilized Amberlite XAD-16 was used as biosorbent. Effects of critical parameters such as pH, flow rate of samples, amount of Amberlite XAD-16 and biosorbent, sample volume, eluent type, and volume and concentration of eluent on column preconcentration of Cu2+ and Ni2+ were optimized. Applicability of the method was validated through the analysis of the certified reference tea sample (NCS ZC73014). Sensitivity of ICP-OES was improved by 36.4-fold for Cu2+ and 38.0-fold for Ni2+ by SPE-ICP-OES method. Limit of quantitation (LOQ) was found to be 0.7 and 1.1ng/ml for Cu2+ and Ni2+, respectively. Concentrations of Cu2+ and Ni2+ were determined by ICP-OES after application of developed method. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) were lower than 4.9% for Cu2+ and 7.9% for Ni2+. The Tigris River that irrigates a large agricultural part of Southeast Turkey is polluted by domestic and industrial wastes. Concentrations of Cu2+ and Ni2+ were determined in water, soil, and some edible vegetables as a biomonitor for heavy metal pollution.",0
"A series of novel 2-aryl-5-((1-aryl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methylthio)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles have been synthesised by C-S bond formation and azide-alkyne cyclocondensation between [5-(aryl)-[1,3,4]oxadiazol-2-yl]methanethiol, propargyl bromide, and substituted aryl azides in one pot with an aim to explore their effect on the in vitro growth of microorganisms causing microbial infection. In vitro antibacterial activity was determined against four strains, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and antifungal activity against two fungal strains, namely Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus.",0
"Bacterial surface motility, such as swarming, is commonly examined in the laboratory using plate assays that necessitate specific concentrations of agar and sometimes inclusion of specific nutrients in the growth medium. The preparation of such explicit media and surface growth conditions serves to provide the favorable conditions that allow not just bacterial growth but coordinated motility of bacteria over these surfaces within thin liquid films. Reproducibility of swarm plate and other surface motility plate assays can be a major challenge. Especially for more ""temperate swarmers"" that exhibit motility only within agar ranges of 0.4%-0.8% (wt/vol), minor changes in protocol or laboratory environment can greatly influence swarm assay results. ""Wettability"", or water content at the liquid-solid-air interface of these plate assays, is often a key variable to be controlled. An additional challenge in assessing swarming is how to quantify observed differences between any two (or more) experiments. Here we detail a versatile two-phase protocol to prepare and image swarm assays. We include guidelines to circumvent the challenges commonly associated with swarm assay media preparation and quantification of data from these assays. We specifically demonstrate our method using bacteria that express fluorescent or bioluminescent genetic reporters like green fluorescent protein (GFP), luciferase (lux operon), or cellular stains to enable time-lapse optical imaging. We further demonstrate the ability of our method to track competing swarming species in the same experiment.",0
"The causative agents of skin infection are bacteria, fungi and in specific dermatophytes. Many infectious diseases have been treated with plant extracts. The free and bound flavonoids fractions of Wrightia tinctoria ( Roxb) R.Br. (Apocynaceae), leaves were tested against 10 bacterial, 3 fungal and 4 dermatophytic strains affecting the skin using disc diffusion and broth micro dilution method. The free flavonoidal extract showed maximum activity against Bacillus subtilis (gram positive), Proteus vulgaris (gram negative), Candida albicans (fungus) and Trichophyton rubrum (dermatophyte). The bound flavonoidal extract showed maximum activity against Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive), Escherichia coli (gram negative), Candida albicans (fungus) and Epidermophyton floccosum (dermatophytes) among the various tested organisms. The bounded flavonoidal extract (activity index 0.58) had strong activity against dermatophytes. This provides a lead that, flavonoidal extract could be used for direct incorporation into formulations for effective treatment and a scientific rationale for the traditional use of Wrightia tinctoria in treating skin infections.",0
"Small RNAs are ubiquitously present regulators in all kingdoms of life. Most bacterial and archaeal small RNAs (sRNAs) act by antisense mechanisms on multiple target mRNAs, thereby globally affecting essentially any conceivable traitestress responses, adaptive metabolic changes, virulence etc. The sRNAs display many distinct mechanisms of action, most of them through effects on target mRNA translation and/or stability, and helper proteins like Hfq often play key roles. Recent data highlight the interplay between posttranscriptional control by sRNAs and transcription factor-mediated transcriptional control, and cross talk through mutual regulation of regulators. Based on the properties that distinguish sRNA-type from transcription factors-type control, we begin to glimpse why sRNAs have evolved as a second, essential layer of gene regulation. This review will discuss the prevalence of sRNAs, who they are, what biological roles they play, and how they carry out their functions.",0
"The honeybees (Apis mellifera) population is declining. The involved causes may be pathogens (mites, viruses and bacteria) and parasites, due to honeybee's compromised immune system, leading to various bee-associated infections. Therefore, the present study assessed the comparative efficacy of plant extracts, including neem (Azadirachta indica) and Barbaka (Vitex trifolia) against gut bacteria and ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor of honeybee A. mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The in vitro activities of the plant extracts were determined by using standard methods against five bee gut bacterial isolates, including the well-known bee pathogenic bacteria Paenibacillus larvae. Miticides were also assessed in field against honeybee mites. The obtained results from the phytochemical screening of Barbaka and neem extracts efficiency showed inhibitory zones with diameters of 23 mm with 60 mg/mL against P. larvae and 14 mm with 60 mg/mL against Escherichia coli, respectively. None of the extracts proved to be effective against Salmonella enterica and the neem extract showed intermediate activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus hominis. Likewise, Barbaka plant extracts were not effective against B. subtilis. Similarly, the relative treatment efficacies of neem and Barbaka extracts, together with conventional miticides against honeybee Varroa mites, varied significantly. However, the effect of Barbaka and neem extracts on the mite-infested colonies was lower than the effect of other treatments, but it was also higher than in the control colonies. This study concluded that Barbaka and neem extracts have antibacterial and miticidal activity and are reasonably safe. However, more trials have to be conducted, in order to validate these results.",0
"In this study, we characterized prophenoloxidase (proPO, (PPO)) genes of Tribolium castaneum and examined their involvement in antimicrobial host defense. Amino acid sequence comparison with well-characterized PPO proteins from other insect species suggested that T. castaneum PPO genes encoded functional proenzymes, with crucial sequence motifs being conserved. Developmental kinetics of the mRNA of two PPO genes, PPO1 and PPO2 in the pupal stage were different to each other. The PPO1 mRNA levels consistently decreased during pupal development while that of PPO2 peaked at mid-pupal stage. The two mRNAs also exhibited distinct responses upon immune challenges with heat-killed model microbes. The PPO1 mRNA stayed nearly unchanged by 6 h post challenge, and was somewhat elevated at 24 h. In contrast, the PPO2 mRNA significantly decreased at 3, 6 and 24 h post challenge. These trends exhibited by respective PPO genes were consistent irrespective of the microbial species used as elicitors. Finally, we investigated the involvement of T. castaneum PPO genes in antimicrobial host defense by utilizing RNA interference-mediated gene silencing. Survival assays demonstrated that double knockdown of PPO genes, which was accompanied by weakened hemolymph PO activities, significantly impaired the host defense against Bacillus subtilis. By contrast, the knockdown did not influence the induction of any of the T. castaneum antimicrobial peptide genes that were studied here, except for one belonging to the gene group that shows very weak or negligible microbial induction. PPO knockdown as well weakened host defense against Beauveria bassiana moderately but significantly depending on the combination of infection methods and targeted genes. Our results indicated that the PPO genes represented constituents of both antibacterial and antifungal host defense of T. castaneum. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Certain Bacillus strains are important producers of antimicrobial peptides with great potential for biological control. Antimicrobial peptide production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens P11 was investigated in the presence of heat-inactivated cells of bacteria and fungi. B. amyloliquefaciens P11 exhibited higher antimicrobial activity in the presence of inactivated cells of Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus parasiticus compared to other conditions tested. Expression of essential genes related to biosynthesis of the antimicrobial peptides surfactin (sfp), iturin A (lpa-14 and ituD), subtilosin A (sboA) and fengycin (fenA) was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The genes lpa-14 and ituD were highly expressed in the presence of S. aureus (inactivated cells), indicating induction of iturin A production by B. amyloliquefaciens P11. The other inducing condition (inactivated cells of A. parasiticus) suppressed expression of lpa-14, but increased expression of ituD. A twofold increase in fenA expression was observed for both conditions, while strong suppression of sboA expression was observed in the presence of inactivated cells of S. aureus. An increase in antimicrobial activity was observed, indicating that synthesis of antimicrobial peptides may be induced by target microorganisms. (C) 2015 Institut Pasteur.

"Organisms are exposed to mixtures of multiple contaminants and it is necessary to build prediction models for the joint effects, considering the high expense and the complexity of the traditional toxicity testing and the flood occurrence of environmental chemical pollutants. In this study, a new method for predicting the joint effects was developed and corresponding prediction models were constructed based on the kinetic models of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. While, we utilized Vibrio fischeri, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis as model organisms and determined the chronic toxicity of the binary mixtures of sulfonamides (SAs) and sulfonamide potentiators (SAPs) (SA + SAP), the mixtures of two kinds of sulfonamides (SA + SA) and the binary mixtures of sulfonamide potentiators (SAPs) and tetracyclines (TCs) (SAP + TC) respectively. Finally, corresponding mixture toxicity data was utilized to fit and verify the prediction models for different joint effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"A new isocoumarin derivative, similanpyrone C (1), a new cyclohexapeptide, similanamide (2), and a new pyripyropene derivative, named pyripyropene T (3) were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the culture of the marine sponge-associated fungus Aspergillus similanensis KUFA 0013. The structures of the compounds were established based on 1D and 2D NMR spectral analysis, and in the case of compound 2 the stereochemistry of its amino acid constituents was determined by chiral HPLC analysis of the hydrolysate by co-injection with the d and l amino acids standards. Compounds 2 and 3 were evaluated for their in vitro growth inhibitory activity against MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer) and A373 (melanoma) cell lines, as well as antibacterial activity against reference strains and the environmental multidrug-resistant isolates (MRS and VRE). Only compound 2 exhibited weak activity against the three cancer cell lines, and neither of them showed antibacterial activity.",0
"The proximity of a biological control agent and its associated anti-microbial metabolites to pathogens on plant surfaces can determine the outcome of disease control. In this study we investigated whether deficiencies in inoculum deposition and localization could explain the inability of the biological control agent Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain TrigoCor to consistently control Fusarium head blight in the field, despite producing effective and consistent disease control in greenhouse settings. Using epifluorescent stereomicroscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we visualized the coverage of wheat spike surfaces by Bacillus post-application in greenhouse and field environments, and determined that there are large unprotected areas on wheat spikes sprayed with commercial-scale field equipment, as compared to typical greenhouse applications. Additionally, we found that in conditions of low relative humidity, antifungal compounds produced by Bacillus were not able to diffuse across wheat surfaces in biologically relevant amounts, further suggesting that the inadequate coverage of wheat surfaces by Bacillus could be directly limiting disease control. Bacillus cells were easily rinsed off wheat surfaces within 8 h of application, indicating that rainfastness might be an additional limitation of biological control in field settings. Finally, we observed the inhibition of Fusarium graminearum spore germination by TrigoCor inoculum on wheat surfaces, confirming this as a mode of action for TrigoCor biocontrol. Future optimization efforts for biological control agents applied to above-ground plant parts should focus on enhancing the rainfastness, quantity, and spatial coverage of the inoculum on plant surfaces.

". In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.

"Background: This study assessed the photochemical fate of nine sulfonamides (sulfamerazine, sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole and sulfadimethoxine) during a 6 h irradiation period with UVA/UVB-light and UVA-light and over 7 days under natural (sunlight) conditions. The cell growth inhibition effect and cytotoxicity of sulfonamides and their photodegradation products was investigated over 24 and 48 h with murine fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Antibacterial activity of the degradation products was studied using the Geobacillus stearothermophilus var. Calidolactis C953 assay. Results: UVA/UVB treatment of several sulfonamide solutions results in degradation of the compounds in different amounts with the highest degradation rate for sulfathiazole and sulfanilamide. The UVA/UVB light degradation products exhibit no antimicrobial activity. Sun light exposure over 7 days reveals a similar degradation pattern of the different sulfonamides, albeit to a different extent. Compared with UVA/UVB-irradiation, UVA-irradiated sulfonamides degrade to a lesser extent (except sulfamethazine). There was no impact on cell toxicity of the UVA/UVB-degrading products except for sulfanilamide, while a slight impact on cell proliferation was observed. Conclusions: All studied sulfonamides undergo photodegradation under UV-light exposure to a greater or lesser extent. The degradation products have no cytotoxic potential except sulfanilamide and have a slight impact on cell proliferation. All degradation products showed no antibacterial activity. Thus, UV-light exposure seems to represent an adequate method for inactivating sulfonamides with regard to their antimicrobial activity. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
"The gene duster responsible for synthesis of the unknown molecule ""colibactin"" has been identified in mutualistic and pathogenic Escherichia coli. The pathway endows its producer with a long-term persistence phenotype in the human bowel, a probiotic activity used in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, and a carcinogenic activity under host inflammatory conditions. To date, functional small molecules from this pathway have not been reported. Here we implemented a comparative metabolomics and targeted structural network analyses approach to identify a catalog of small molecules dependent on the colibactin pathway from the meningitis isolate E. coli IHE3034 and the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. The structures of 10 pathway-dependent small molecules are proposed based on structural characterizations and network relationships. The network will provide a roadmap for the structural and functional elucidation of a variety of other small molecules encoded by the pathway. From the characterized small molecule set, in vitro bacterial growth inhibitory and mammalian CNS receptor antagonist activities are presented.",0
"A new alkalophilic low-molecular-mass chitinase of 14 kD from the potent biocontrol agent Bacillus subtilis JN032305 was partially purified and enzymology of the chitinase was studied. The enzyme showed optimal pH of 9.0 and temperature of 50 degrees C. The enzyme was found stable during the 60-min incubation at 50 degrees C. The chitinase was inhibited by group specific agents like IAA, DAN, TLCK, and SDS and metal ions Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Mn2+, Ba2+, and Hg2+, whereas Zn2+ did not show significant inhibitory effect against the chitinase. PMSF partially inhibited the enzyme. Substrates specificity tests indicated that the enzyme showed 75% of relative activity on glycol chitin, 58% on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), 33% on chitin flakes, and 166% laminarin compared to that on colloidal chitin. The enzyme also hydrolyzed 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminide, indicating its chitobiase activity. The chitinase of this study has broad specificity, which could hydrolyze not only the glycosidic bond in GlcNAc-GlcNAc but also that of related carbohydrates with glycosidic linkages. The partially purified chitinase not only showed antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, two potent phytopathogens of chilli, but also increased the germination of chilli seeds when infected with the two potent phytopathogenic fungi.",0
"Black silicon is a synthetic nanomaterial that contains high aspect ratio nanoprotrusions on its surface, produced through a simple reactive-ion etching technique for use in photovoltaic applications. Surfaces with high aspect-ratio nanofeatures are also common in the natural world, for example, the wings of the dragonfly Diplacodes bipunctata. Here we show that the nanoprotrusions on the surfaces of both black silicon and D. bipunctata wings form hierarchical structures through the formation of clusters of adjacent nanoprotrusions. These structures generate a mechanical bactericidal effect, independent of chemical composition. Both surfaces are highly bactericidal against all tested Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and endospores, and exhibit estimated average killing rates of up to similar to 450,000 cells min(-1) cm(-2). This represents the first reported physical bactericidal activity of black silicon or indeed for any hydrophilic surface. This biomimetic analogue represents an excellent prospect for the development of a new generation of mechano-responsive, antibacterial nanomaterials.",0
"Like other bacteria, Mycobacterium spp. have developed different strategies in response to environmental changes such as nutrient limitations and other different stress situations. We have identified candidate genes (rsb genes) from Mycobacterium marinum involved in the regulation of the activity of the alternative sigma factor, sigma F. This is a homolog of the master regulator of general stress response, sigma B, and the sporulation-specific sigma factor, sigma F, in Bacillus subtilis. The organization of these genes in M.marinum and B.subtilis is similar. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR data show that these genes are indeed expressed in M.marinum and that the levels of expression vary with growth phase and exposure to stress. In particular, cold stress caused a significant rise in the expression of all identified rsb and sigF genes. We discuss these data in relation to what is currently known for other Mycobacterium spp.",0
"Shrimp hatcheries often beset with diseases, mainly the bacterial infection and antibiotics are widely used for prevention of disease. Presently, beneficial bacteria (probiotics) are used to prevent diseases instead of antibiotics and increasing the production. In the present study, the two new microbial strains Bacillus megaterium and Streptomyces fradiae isolated from mangrove sediments were applied (experimental culture) for the post larval rearing of Penaeus monodon which is compared with control culture tanks (without probiotics). The water quality condition such as temperature (27-29°C), salinity (26-28 per mil) and dissolved oxygen (4.7-5.0 mg L -1) of both control and experimental culture were more or less similar. Concentration of ammonia and pH were significantly different (p<0.05) between the control and experimental culture during the study period. The feed assimilation efficiency is higher (above 80%) in experimental culture tank when compared to control tank (74.76%). The growth rate was higher - 1.70 and 1.67 in S. fradiae, 1.66 and 1.63 in B. megaterium - through feed and water, respectively, while in control tank it was 1.4. The FCR values were 2.06 and 2.12 in S. fradiae treated tanks through feed and water, respectively, while 2.51 and 2.55 were observed in B. megaterium treated through feed and water respectively. The FCR value was found higher (4.02) in the control tank. The average total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) and total presumptive Vibrio bacteria both in culture water and post larvae were lower during experimental culture in compared to control culture. The present study indicates that the probiotic treatment using two new microbial strains such as B. megaterium and S. fradiae would help in better aquaculture production.",0
"Volatile oils from the leaves, flowers and rhizomes of Dietes bicolor (Steud.) Sweet ex Klatt (Iridaceae) were analyzed using GLC/FID and GLC/MS. A total of 84 compounds were identified accounting for 94.65, 95.63 and 87.09% in the hydrodistilled oils from flowers, leaves and rhizomes, respectively. Spathulenol (48.44%) represented the major component in the leaf oil, followed by dihydro-edulan I (6.25%), cubenol (6.00%) and t-cadinol (5.90%). For the flower and rhizome oils, fatty acids, their esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives predominate. The antimicrobial activity of both leaf and flower oils was investigated against four bacteria in addition to four fungi using the micro-broth dilution method. The leaf oil showed a more potent antimicrobial activity as compared to the flower oil against most of the assessed bacteria and fungi, with higher activities against Gram-positive organisms showing MIC values of 115 and 460 mu g/ml for Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumonia, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria were generally less susceptible (MIC > 2 mg/ml for both oils against Escherichia coli) and being completely ineffective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A relevant antifungal potency of the leaf oil against Geotrichum candidum and Syncephalastrum racemosum was also observed with MIC values of 115 and 920 mu g/ml, respectively.",0
"The phytochemical, antibacterial and haematologic activity of aqueous seed extract of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) were evaluated. Phytochemicals such as tannins, carbohydrates, alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, anthraquinones and flavonoids in low, moderate and high concentrations were present in the seeds. The extract exhibited significant In vitro antibacterial and In vivo haematologic effects. Bacterial isolates such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeroginosa were inhibited. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the extract for all the sensitive isolates is 100 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml as minimum bactericidal concentration of the extract on Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Escherichia coli. The extract administered per os at 100-400 mg/kg body weight significantly (P<0.05) increased, neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil and monocytes counts at second and third week of administration except for lymphocyte that significantly (P<0.05) decreased throughout the period of administration when compared to the rats in control group. The study supports the folkloric application of Moringa oleifera seed extract in the management of various forms of bacterial infection, anaemia and immuno-modulation in north eastern Nigeria.",0
"Background: The YvcK protein is essential for Bacillus subtilis growth on gluconeogenic conditions; its overproduction rescues an mreB mutant. Results: PrkC phosphorylates YvcK; this phosphorylation is not required for growth on gluconeogenic conditions but is necessary for mreB rescue. Conclusion: YvcK phosphorylation is specifically involved in B. subtilis morphogenesis. Significance: This phosphorylation-based regulatory mechanism could be widespread in bacteria. The YvcK protein has been shown to be necessary for growth under gluconeogenic conditions in Bacillus subtilis. Amazingly, its overproduction rescues growth and morphology defects of the actin-like protein MreB deletion mutant by restoration of PBP1 localization. In this work, we observed that YvcK was phosphorylated at Thr-304 by the protein kinase PrkC and that phosphorylated YvcK was dephosphorylated by the cognate phosphatase PrpC. We show that neither substitution of this threonine with a constitutively phosphorylated mimicking glutamic acid residue or a phosphorylation-dead mimicking alanine residue nor deletion of prkC or prpC altered the ability of B. subtilis to grow under gluconeogenic conditions. However, we observed that a prpC mutant and a yvcK mutant were more sensitive to bacitracin compared with the WT strain. In addition, the bacitracin sensitivity of strains in which YvcK Thr-304 was replaced with either an alanine or a glutamic acid residue was also affected. We also analyzed rescue of the mreB mutant strain by overproduction of YvcK in which the phosphorylation site was substituted. We show that YvcK T304A overproduction did not rescue the mreB mutant aberrant morphology due to PBP1 mislocalization. The same observation was made in an mreB prkC double mutant overproducing YvcK. Altogether, these data show that YvcK may have two distinct functions: 1) in carbon source utilization independent of its phosphorylation level and 2) in cell wall biosynthesis and morphogenesis through its phosphorylation state.",0
"We report the biocontrol activity of the endophytic bacteria Bacillus pumilus and Bacillus amyloliquefacies against the plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain NS4 transformed with the GFP expressing gene. P. s. pv. tomato strain NS4 was obtained from the transformation of P. s. pv. tomato wild-type strain NW with the plasmid pNKGFP containing GFP-cassette for chromosomal integration. The GFP-marked strain was tested for hypersensitivity and pathogenicity, as well as population studies on the phylloplane, to determine its epidemiology and survival. In all of the bioassays strain NS4 presented similar characteristics to the wild-type, and was hence chosen as the model strain for these studies with antagonistic endophytic bacterial strains. In the biocontrol experiments, tomato plants were pre-inoculated with the endophytic bacteria 4 days prior to inoculation with P. s. pv. tomato strains. On the tomato phylloplane the P. s. pv. tomato (strains NW and NS4) populations were drastically reduced, and tomato leaves showed reduced numbers of bacterial speck lesions, comparable to the standard chemical treatment copper oxychloride. Additionally, under epifluorescence microscopy, few GFP-tagged cells of strain NS4 were observed colonizing important niches on the tomato phylloplane. However, leaves untreated with the antagonists presented a large number of GFP-tagged cell aggregates. Our results demonstrated that endophytic bacteria can also act efficiently on the biocontrol of bacterial speck when applied as a foliar spray on the leaves. In addition, we highlighted the use of GFP-marked strain NS4 as a model system to study biocontrol agent and pathogen interactions, and growth and development of the pathogen on the tomato leaf surface.",0
"Carboxylic acid imides 1-26 have been synthesized and screened for their antibacterial against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and their antitumor activity against 60 tumor cell lines taken from nine different organs. Compounds 12, 14, and 16 were the most active and broad-spectrum antibacterial member in this study. Compound 9 showed the most cytotoxicity with a significant inhibition for renal cancer cells. 2D-QSAR study provides details on the fine relationship linking structure and activity and offers clues for structural modifications that can improve the activity. Docking study of the compounds 12, 14, and 16 into the active site of the topoisomerase II DNA gyrase enzymes revealed a similar binding mode to bound inhibitor Clorobiocin.",0
"The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase core enzyme in Gram-positive bacteria consists of seven subunits. Whilst four of them (alpha(2)beta beta) are essential, three smaller subunits, delta, epsilon and omega (similar to 9-21.5 kDa), are considered accessory. Both d and. have been viewed as integral components of RNAP for several decades; however, epsilon has only recently been described. Functionally these three small subunits carry out a variety of tasks, imparting important, supportive effects on the transcriptional process of Gram-positive bacteria. While omega is thought to have a wide range of roles, reaching from maintaining structural integrity of RNAP to sigma factor recruitment, the only suggested function for epsilon thus far is in protecting cells from phage infection. The third subunit, delta, has been shown to have distinct influences in maintaining transcriptional specificity, and thus has a key role in cellular fitness. Collectively, all three accessory subunits, although dispensable under laboratory conditions, are often thought to be crucial for proper RNAP function. Herein we provide an overview of the available literature on each subunit, summarizing landmark findings that have deepened our understanding of these proteins and their function, and outline future challenges in understanding the role of these small subunits in the transcriptional process.",0
"Plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Bacillus subtilis UD1022 has been shown to trigger an induced systemic response in Arabidopsis thaliana. This interaction causes plant stomata to close, protecting the plant from infection by plant pathogens and thereby increasing crop yield. The purpose of this study was to determine whether UD1022 applied to the roots of plants is able to induce stomata closure in leafy greens as well as influence the persistence of human pathogens (Listeria and Salmonella) on plants. UD1022 induced stomata closure in the presence of human pathogens on both lettuce and spinach 3h post-inoculation (p<0.0001). Results were confirmed by root inoculation with heat-killed UD1022, which did not induce stomata closure. Presence of UD1022 on lettuce roots significantly reduced the persistence of Listeria on plants after 3 days post-inoculation (p=0.02) but had less of an effect on the persistence of Salmonella. The results of this study indicate that plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium B. subtilis UD1022 may be able to prevent contamination by some human pathogens. This is the first study to investigate the use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria to control the persistence of human pathogens on plants.",1
"The Toll pathway regulates innate immunity in insects and vertebrates. The Drosophila Toll receptor is activated by a processed form of a ligand, Spatzle. Spatzle-processing enzyme (SPE) is the only enzyme identified to date that functions in converting Spatzle to an active form during the immune response. In the present study, Toll activation induced by immune challenge was almost suppressed in spatzle mutant larvae and adults, whereas it was present in SPE mutant larvae challenged with Micrococcus luteus and adults challenged with Bacillus subtilis. Our data suggest that an unidentified protease besides SPE processes Spatzle under conditions of microbial challenge.",0
"The infections treatment failures and their costs were mainly caused by resistant bacteria required to find alternative care, recently, natural products have proved to be an alternative to synthetic chemical substances, for that the present study was initiated to evaluate the antibacterial activity of aqueous decocted and methanolic pomegranate peels extract against two pathogenic multidrug resistant Gram-negative and positive bacteria ( Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300, Bacillus subtilis) by disc diffusion method; the aqueous decocted extract showed strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300 and Bacillus subtilis compared to methanolic extract, otherwise the inhibition zones produced at 50 mg/ml were respectively 280 and 240 mm for aqueous decocted extract and 26.761.36, 220 mm for methanolic extract; for Gram-negative bacteria, it has been observed a decrease in the activity of the same extracts compared to Gram positive bacteria, the diameter of inhibition zone at 50 mg/ml of Enterobacter cloacae and Salmonella typhi tested with methanolic extract was respectively 140 and 9.761.36 mm, while the inhibition zone produced tested with aqueous decocted extract were respectively 20.50.5 and 10.50.5 mm.",0
"The addition of probiotics in diets aims to act as a growth promoter of intestinal flora species that make use of it. The nursery phase in cages uses high density of fish that can lead to more frequent instances of stress that can leverage the most serious problems in production. The probiotics appears as an alternative to minimize or prevent damage. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of probiotic Bacillus cereus var. Toyoi and Bacillus subtilis C-3201 in the parasitic prevalence and verify the health status through the biochemical profile of glucose and cortisol and Fulton condition factor (Kf) to act as a quantitative indicator of welfare of Nile tilapia GIFT strains created in cages system profile. A total of 1800 juveniles of Nile tilapia were distributed in 20 cages of 4.0 mm and 0.5 m *0,5 m *0,7 m individually installed in tanks with low water renewal. The fish without the addition of probiotics ( T1 ) received just the basal diet feed with vegetable oil added in the same proportions used in all experimental groups. The basal feed was added at levels of 0.5% of B. cereus var. ( T2 ), 0.5% of B. subtilis ( T3 ), 0.25% of B. cereus + 0.25% of B. subtilis ( T4 ). The diets with addition of B. cereus and/or B. subtilis were not effective in controlling the parasitic infestation by monogenean and tricodinids. There was a greater (p<0.001) incidence of Gyrodactylus spp. (71%) in the gills compared to prevalence of parasites on the skin or fins, while Apiosoma sp. infestation was greater (p<0.001) in the skin of juveniles. The prevalence of Epistylis sp., Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Ambiphrya spp. did not present significant difference between the assessed organs. The level of blood glucose was higher (p<0.05) in tilapias fed a diet free of additives. The dietary probiotic B. cereus and/or B. subtilis not positively contribute to the reduction the prevalence of ectoparasites on fish mucus. Regardless of the diet, the Nile tilapia skin is the most affected organ by parasitic infestation by Trichodina sp., while the gills have a higher prevalence of Monogenea. The health status of juvenile Nile tilapia monitored through biochemical profile of glucose and cortisol, and Fulton condition factor (Kf) is not influenced by the dietary addition of probiotic Bacillus spp.",0
"Our objective is to evaluate the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts of Plectranthus mollis ( P. mollis) and Salvia officinalis ( S. officinalis) leaves locally used for treatment of microbial infection in Nilgiris of India. Antibacterial activity was determined by using agar diffusion and broth dilution methods against seven microorganisms. The antioxidant potential was assessed by using 2,2 diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazine (DPPH) scavenging assay. Ethanolic extract of P. mollis showed antibacterial activity in the following order viz Pseudomonas aerugenosa (20 mm, MIC of 12.5 g/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (19 mm, MIC of 6.3 g/ml), Bacillus cereus (18 mm, MIC of 25 g/ml), Salmonella typhimurium (16 mm, MIC of 25 g/ml) and Bacillus subtilis (14 mm, MIC of 12.5 g/ml). Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to ethanolic extract of P. mollis, whereas the ethanolic extract of S. officinalis and control (DMSO) did not show any inhibition against all the bacteria tested. Both the extracts possess marked DPPH radical scavenging activities compared to the reference antioxidant ascorbic acid in a dose dependent manner with the IC50 values being 73.26 g/ml, 107 g/ml and 40.17 g/ml for P. mollis, S. officinalis and ascorbic acid respectively. Based on the results, it may be confirmed that the antioxidants might have enhanced the antibacterial activities of P. mollis. But S. officinalis did not show any antibacterial activities even though it has good antioxidant potential than P. mollis. Further studies on isolation and purification of compounds that are responsible for their antibacterial and antioxidant activities are needed.",0
"Background: This study examined the effectiveness of commercially available disinfecting wipes and cosmetic wipes in disinfecting pulse oximeter sensors contaminated with pathogenic bacterial surrogates. Methods: Surrogates of potential biological warfare agents and bacterial pathogens associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) were spotted on test surfaces, with and without an artificial test soil (sebum), allowed to dry, and then cleaned with different commercially available cleaning and disinfecting wipes or sterile gauze soaked in water, bleach (diluted 1:10), or 70% isopropanol. The percentage of microbial survival and an analytical estimation of remaining test soil on devices were determined. Results: Wipes containing sodium hypochlorite as the active ingredient and gauze soaked in bleach (1:10) were the most effective in removing both vegetative bacteria and spores. In the presence of selective disinfectants, sebum had a protective effect on vegetative bacteria, but not on spores. Conclusions: The presence of sebum reduces the cleaning efficiency of some commercially available wipes for some select microbes. Various commercial wipes performed significantly better than the designated cleaning agent (70% isopropanol) in disinfecting the oximetry sensor. Cosmetic wipes were not more effective than the disinfecting wipes in removing sebum. Copyright (C) 2016 by the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

"Objective To achieve secretory expression of LfcinB in Saccharomyces cescerevisiae and determine its activity. Methods The DNA sequence of LfcinB was designed based On the codon bias of S. cescerevisiae, then synthesized chemically and inserted into vector pYES2-alpha. The constructed recombinant plasmid pYES2-alpha-LfcinB was transformed to S. cescerevisiae INVSc1 cells and induced with galactose. The inhibiting activities of expressed LfcinB to E. coli DH5 alpha and Bacillus subtilis were determined by a single dose cylinder-plate method. The concentration of inducer as well as time and temperature for induction were optimized, and stability of recombinant LfcinB was determined. Results Restriction analysis and sequencing proved that recombinant plasmid pYES2-alpha-LfcinB was constructed correctly. The expressed product showed specific protein bands with relative molecular masses of 5 164 and 4 355 on SDS-PAGE profile. The target protein content in each liter of fermentation liquid was about 2. 878 5 mg. The expressed LfcinB showed significantly inhibiting activities to E. coli DH5 alpha and B. sub tilis. The inhibiting activities reached the peak values after induction of recombinant S. cerevisiae with 3% galactose at 26 degrees C for 96 h. Recombinant LfcinB showed heat stability, of which the activity was not influenced in presence of disulfide bond. Conclusion Biologically active LfcinB was successfully expressed in S. cerevisiae in secretory form, which laid a foundation of further study on biological function and application of LfcinB.",0
"Bacillus subtilis B006 strain effectively suppresses the cucumber fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum (Foc). The population dynamics of Foc, strain B006 and its surfactin over-producing mutant B841 and surfactin-deficient mutant B1020, in the rhizosphere were determined under greenhouse conditions to elucidate the importance of the lipopeptides excreted by these strains in suppressing Foe. Results showed that B. subtilis strain B006 effectively suppressed the disease in natural soil by 42.9%, five weeks after transplanting, whereas B841 and B1020 suppressed the disease by only 22.6% and 7.1%, respectively. Quantitative PCR assays showed that effective colonization of strain B006 in the rhizosphere suppressed Foe propagation by more than 10 times both in nursery substrate and in field-infected soil. Reduction of Foe population at the cucumber stems in a range of 0.96 log(10) ng/g to 2.39 log(10) ng/gwas attained at the third and the fifth weeks of B006 treatment in nursery substrate. In field-infected soil, all three treatments with B. subtilis suppressed Foe infection, indicated by the reduction of Foe population at a range of 2.91 log(10) ng/g to 3.36 log(10) ng/g at the stem base, one week after transplanting. This study reveals that the suppression of fusarium wilt disease is affected by the effective colonization of the surfactin-producing B. subtilis strain in the rhizosphere. These results improved our understanding of the biocontrol mechanism of the B. subtilis strain B006 in the natural soil and facilitate its application as biocontrol agent in the field.",1
"An efficient immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography method was used to screen potential antimicrobial peptides from boiled-dried anchovies. A novel cationic antimicrobial peptide (Apep10) was successfully isolated by one-step chromatography. The sequence of Apep10 was identified as GLARCLAGTL by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-Q-TOF MS). The antimicrobial activity assessment indicated that Apep10 inhibited the growth of the reference bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae), with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 8 to 64 mu g/mL. Almost no cytotoxicity against mouse erythrocytes was observed at concentrations below 20 mu g/mL. Nucleotide leakage induced by Apep10 showed that the peptide exhibited permeable activity on the cytoplasmic membrane. Alterations in morphology were observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Membrane disruption was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with propidium iodide (PI). The results demonstrate that immobilized bacterial membrane liposome chromatography is a straightforward technique for screening unknown antimicrobial peptides with cell-membrane-interacting activities from boiled-dried anchovies.",0
"Two new diterpenes, libertellenone G(1) and libertellenone H(2) were isolated from the fungus Eutypella sp. D-1 isolated from the soil of high latitude of Arctic, together with two known pimarane diterpenes (3-4). The structures of 1 and 2 were elucidated from spectroscopic data (nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and infrared). These compounds were evaluated for cytotoxic activity against seven human tumor cell lines. Compound 2 showed a range of cytotoxicity between 3.31 and 44.1 mu M. Compound 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.",0
"The present study deals with the enzyme mediated biotransformation of arsenic in five arsenic tolerant strains (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Paenibacillus macerans and Escherichia coli). Biotransformation ability of these isolates was evaluated by monitoring arsenite oxidase and arsenate reductase activity. Results showed that arsenic oxidase activity was exclusively present in P. macerans and B. pumilus while B. subtilis, B. megaterium and E. coli strains showed presence of Arsenic oxido-reductase enzyme. The reversible nature of arsenic oxido-reductase suggested that same enzyme can carry out oxidation and reduction of arsenic depending upon the relative concentration of arsenic species. Lineweaver-Burk plot of the arsenite oxidase activity in P. macerans showed highest K-m value (K-m-200 mu M) and lower V-max (0.012 mu mol mg(-1) protein min(-1)) indicating lowest affinity of the enzyme for arsenite. On the contrary, E. coli showed the lower K-m value (K-m-38.46 mu M) and higher V-max (0.044 mu mol mg(-1) protein min(-1)) suggesting for higher affinity for the arsenite. Lineweaver-Burk plot of arsenate reductase activity showed the presence of this enzyme in B. subtilis, B. megaterium and E. coli which were in the range of 200-360 mu M K-m and V-max value between 0.256-0.129 mmol mg(-1) protein min(-1). These results suggested that affinity of the as reductase enzyme is lowest for arsenate than that for the arsenite. Thus, arsenite oxidase system appears to be a predominant mechanism of cellular defense in these bacterial strains.",0
"In this study, 342 bacterial strains were isolated from the gut of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus. Two different screening strategies, including the production of antagonistic effects against pathogens and the capacity of secreting exoenzyme, were used to select potential probiotics from the bacterial strains. Among them, 6 isolates showed antagonism against the pathogens, 15 isolates could produce high amylase and protease, and 3 isolates (BHI344, BH0142 and BH03124) had both the two characteristics. Then, BHI344, BH0142, and BH03124 were tested for survival rate in channel catfish bile and at low pH, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and pathogenicity in channel catfish. The results of the obtained assays showed that BHI344 possessed the broadest inhibitory potential, a strong ability of secreting extra-cellular amylase and protease, high viability in simulated gastrointestinal conditions, and sensitivity to most of the used antibiotics and non-pathogenic to channel catfish. Therefore, it could be selected as the most promising probiotics candidate. BHI344 was identified as Bacillus subtilis based on the phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.",0
"The ability of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans to reversibly switch between different morphological forms and establish biofilms is crucial for establishing infection. Targeting phenotypic plasticity and biofilm formation in C. albicans represents a new concept for antifungal drug discovery. The present study evaluated the influence of cyclic lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain AR2 on C. albicans biofilms. The biosurfactant was characterized as a mixture of iturin and fengycin by MALDI-TOF and amino acid analysis. The biosurfactant exhibited concentration dependent growth inhibition and fungicidal activity. The biosurfactant at sub-minimum growth inhibition concentration decreased cell surface hydrophobicity, hindered germ tube formation and reduced the mRNA expression of hyphae-specific gene HWP1 and ALS3 without exhibiting significant growth inhibition. The biosurfactants inhibited biofilm formation in the range of 46-100 % depending upon the concentration and Candida strains. The biosurfactant treatment dislodged 25-100 % of preformed biofilm from polystyrene plates. The biosurfactant retained its antifungal and antibiofilm activity even after exposure to extreme temperature. By virtue of the ability to inhibit germ tube and biofilm formation, two important traits of C. albicans involved in establishing infection, lipopeptides from strain AR2 may represent a potential candidate for developing heat stable anti-Candida drugs.",0
"Anthracnose is a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum species that is detrimental to numerous plant species. Anthracnose control with fungicides has both human health and environmental safety implications. Despite increasing public concerns, fungicide use will continue in the absence of viable alternatives. There have been relatively less efforts to search antagonistic bacteria from mudflats harboring microbial diversity. A total of 420 bacterial strains were isolated from mudflats near the western sea of South Korea. Five bacterial strains, LB01, LB14, HM03, HM17, and LB15, were characterized as having antifungal properties in the presence of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. The three Bacillus atrophaeus strains, LB14, HM03, and HM17, produced large quantities of chitinase and protease enzymes, whereas the B. amyloliquefaciens strain LB01 produced protease and cellulase enzymes. Two important antagonistic traits, siderophore production and solubilization of insoluble phosphate, were observed in the three B. atrophaeus strains. Analyses of disease suppression revealed that LB14 was most effective for suppressing the incidence of anthracnose symptoms on pepper fruits. LB14 produced antagonistic compounds and suppressed conidial germination of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. The results from the present study will provide a basis for developing a reliable alternative to fungicides for anthracnose control.",0
"A new class of oxovanadium(IV) complexes with Schiff bases derived by the condensation of 5-(phenyl/substituted phenyl)-2-hydrazino-1,3,4-thiadiazoles and indoline-2,3-dione have been prepared in ethanol in the presence of sodium acetate. Micro-analytical data, magnetic susceptibility, UV-Vis, IR, EPR and XRD spectral techniques were used to confirm the structures. Electronic absorption spectra of the complexes suggest a square-pyramidal geometry. The oxovanadium(IV) complexes have monoclinic crystal system and particle sizes were found to be in the range 18.0 nm to 24.0 nm (nano-size). In vitro antifungal activity of synthesized compounds was determined against fungi Aspergillus niger, Colletotrichum falcatum and Colletotrichum pallescence and in vitro antibacterial activity was determined by screening the compounds against Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) bacterial strains. The oxovanadium(IV) complexes have higher antimicrobial effect than free ligands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Survival of M. tuberculosis in host macrophages requires the eukaryotic-type protein kinase G, PknG, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. Here, we show that PknG is an integral component of a novel redox homeostatic system, RHOCS, which includes the ribosomal protein L13 and RenU, a Nudix hydrolase encoded by a gene adjacent to pknG. Studies in M. smegmatis showed that PknG expression is uniquely induced by NADH, which plays a key role in metabolism and redox homeostasis. In vitro, RenU hydrolyses FAD, ADP-ribose and NADH, but not NAD+. Absence of RHOCS activities in vivo causes NADH and FAD accumulation, and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress. We show that PknG phosphorylates L13 and promotes its cytoplasmic association with RenU, and the phosphorylated L13 accelerates the RenU-catalyzed NADH hydrolysis. Importantly, interruption of RHOCS leads to impaired mycobacterial biofilms and reduced survival of M. tuberculosis in macrophages. Thus, RHOCS represents a checkpoint in the developmental program required for mycobacterial growth in these environments.",0
"Because antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are potentially useful for the treatment of multidrug-resistant infections, more attention is being paid to the structural modification and structure function relationship of both naturally occurring and synthetic AMPs. Previous studies indicated that Protegrin-1 (PG-1), isolated from porcine leukocytes, exhibited considerable antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity. The 3-turn of PG-1 floated on the surface of bacterial membrane, while its beta-strand inserted into the bacterial membrane and formed pores that were dedicated to producing cytotoxicity. For reducing cytotoxicity and improving cells selectivity, we designed a series of simplified symmetric-end peptides by combining the beta-turn of PG-1 with simple amino acid repeat sequences. The sequence of designed symmetric-end peptides is (XR)(n)H(RX)(n), (n = 1,2; X represents I, F, W and P; H represents CRRRFC). The symmetric-end peptides displayed antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In particular, (XR)(2)H(RX)(2) (X here is I,F and W) showed greater antimicrobial potency than PG-1. Hemolysis activity and cytotoxicity, detected by using human red blood cells (RBCs) and human embryonic lung fibroblasts MRC-5 cells, were observably lower than the native peptide PG-1. (IR)(2)H(RI)(2) (IR2), folded into beta-sheet structures, displayed the highest therapeutic index, suggesting its great cell selectivity. The fluorescence spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy observation indicated that IR2 exhibited great membrane penetration potential by inducing membrane blebbing, disruption and lysis. Collectively, generating symmetric-end beta-sheet peptides is a promising strategy for designing effective AMPs with great antimicrobial activities and cell selectivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Highly conserved ectodomain of influenza virus M2 protein (M2e) is an important target for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Today, the use of chemical or genetic fusion constructs have been undertaken to overcome the low immunogenicity of M2e in vaccine formulation. However, current M2e vaccines are neither orally delivered nor heat-stable. In this study, we evaluated the immune efficacy of an orally delivered recombinant M2e vaccine containing 3 molcules of M2e consensus sequence of influenza A viruses, termed RSM2e3. To accomplish this, CotB, a spore coat of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), was used as a fusion partner, and heat-stable nonpathogenic B. subtilis spores were used as the carrier. Our results showed that CotB-M2e3 fusion had no effect on spore structure or function in the resultant recombinant RSM2e3 strain and that heterologous influenza virus M2e protein was successfully displayed on the surface of the recombinant RSM2e3 spore. Importantly, recombinant RSM2e3 spores elicited strong and long-term M2e-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses, completely protecting immunized mice from lethal challenge of A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza virus. Taken together, our study forms a solid basis for the development of a novel orally delivered and heat-stable influenza vaccine based on B. subtilis spore surface display.",0
"Traditional use of chemical fertilizers in agricultural production can not be over-emphasized, but with fertilizer costs going up, these need to be supplemented or substituted with biofertilizers. Twenty-two plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) isolated from cotton grown in Pakistani soils were selected to assess the range of growth promoting properties. Some important capabilities of practical utility shown by these strains were nitrogenase activity, indole acetic acid (IAA) production, P and Zn mobilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activity and siderophores production. Growth and yield of cotton plant was significantly increased by these bacterial inoculations with different reduced levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers under controlled conditions as well as in field trials of two years. Co-inoculation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Z5 and Bacillus fusiformis S10 with half and 1/4th of the recommended N and P fertilizers improved the boll mass, lint and seed yield compared to un-inoculated controls. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using domain, division and subdivision-level probes was employed in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy for identification of cotton rhizosphere associated bacteria. The results of FISH were found to be in accordance with 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Here we demonstrate that the seed treatment of cotton plants with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Z5 (AY548952) and Bacillus fusiformis S10 (AY548956) can improve growth and yield parameters in cotton fields with reduced levels of chemical fertilizers. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Z5 was deposited to DSMZ German Culture Collection with accession no. DSM16519.",0
"The present invention discloses compositions and methodologies for the utilization of probiotic organisms in therapeutic compositions. More specifically, the present invention relates to the utilization of one or more species or strains of lactic acid-producing bacteria, preferably strains of Bacillus coagulans, for the control of gastrointestinal tract pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant gastrointestinal tract pathogens, and their associated diseases by both a reduction in the rate of colonization and the severity of the deleterious physiological effects of the colonization of the antibiotic-resistant pathogen.",0
"In search of new biologically active compounds, some novel (E)-1-aryl-2-(3,5-dimethyl-4-(aryldiazenyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethanones 3a-u have been synthesized via solvent-free greener approach. All compounds were characterized on the basis of a combined use of IR, NMR (H-1, C-13), mass spectrometry and elemental analyses. In order to establish the position of methyl groups in the compound 3b, 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC and HMBC) spectroscopic technique has also been used. To explore the biological potential, compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial, antioxidant and UV-mediated DNA damage protective activity. Among the series, six compounds 3b, 3i, 3k, 3l, 3m and 3t were found to exhibit a very good level of antibacterial activity and four compounds 3g, 3o, 3p and 3t were emerged as an efficient class of antifungal agents in reference to the standard drugs, viz ciprofloxacin and amphotericin B, respectively. In studying the UV-mediated DNA damage protective activity, all compounds 3a-u (except 3d) protected the plasmid DNA from the UV damaging effect in which 3e was found to be the most potent DNA-protecting agent which avoids the transformation of the native supercoiled form into an open circular and linear form. In addition, the compounds 3f, 3m and 3t were found to be active in antioxidant screening using DPPH assay.",0
"Research and development of potent and effective antimicrobial agents represent one of the most important advances in therapeutics; the main aim of these efforts is not only control the serious infections, but also prevention and treatment of some infectious complications of other therapeutic modalities. A series of 5-(2-aroyl)aryloxy methyl-2-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Anti-bacterial activity against B. cereus, S. aureus, B. subtilis, S. aureus (MRSA), E. aerogenes, M. luteus, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. typhimurium, E. coli, paratyphi-B, P. vulgaris bacterial strains and anti-fungal activity against C. albicans, A. niger, F. solani, A. flavus, B. cinerea, C. krusei, M. pachydermatis, C. parapsilosis, F. moniliforme, C. gloeosporioides fungal strains were carried out.

"Polypeptide antimicrobials used against topical infections are reported to obtain from mesophilic bacterial species. A thermophilic Geobacillus pallidus SAT4 was isolated from hot climate of Sindh Dessert, Pakistan and found it active against Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus subtilis NCTC 10400 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 49189. The current experiment was designed to optimize the production of novel thermostable polypeptide by applying the Taguchi statistical approach at various conditions including the time of incubation, temperature, pH, aeration rate, nitrogen, and carbon concentrations. There were two most important factors that affect the production of antibiotic including time of incubation and nitrogen concentration and two interactions including the time of incubation/pH and time of incubation/nitrogen concentration. Activity was evaluated by well diffusion assay. The antimicrobial produced was stable and active even at 55 C. Ammonium sulphate (AS) was used for antibiotic recovery and it was desalted by dialysis techniques. The resulted protein was evaluated through SDS-PAGE. It was concluded that novel thermostable protein produced by Geobacillus pallidus SAT4 is stable at higher temperature and its production level can be improved statistically at optimum values of pH, time of incubation and nitrogen concentration the most important factors for antibiotic production.",0
"PhoB/PhoR is a two-component system originally described as involved in inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport and metabolism under Pi limitation. In order to disclose other roles of this system, a proteomic analysis of Vibrio cholerae 569BSR and its phoB/phoR mutant under high Pi levels was performed. Most of the proteins downregulated by the mutant have roles in energy production and conversion and in amino acid transport and metabolism. In contrast, the phoB/phoR mutant upregulated genes mainly involved in adaptation to atypical conditions, indicating that the absence of a functional PhoB/PhoR caused increased expression of a number of genes from distinct stress response pathways. This might be a strategy to overcome the lack of RpoS, whose expression in the stationary phase cells of V. cholerae seems to be controlled by PhoB/PhoR. Moreover, compared to the wild-type strain the phoB/phoR mutant presented a reduced cell density at stationary phase of culture in Pi abundance, lower resistance to acid shock, but higher tolerance to thermal and osmotic stresses. Together our findings show, for the first time, the requirement of PhoB/PhoR for full growth under high Pi level and for the accumulation of RpoS, indicating that PhoB/PhoR is a fundamental system for the biology of V. cholerae. Biological significance Certain V. cholerae strains are pathogenic to humans, causing cholera, an acute dehydrating diarrhoeal disease endemic in Southern Asia, parts of Africa and Latin America, where it has been responsible for significant mortality and economical damage. Its ability to grow within distinct niches is dependent on gene expression regulation. PhoB/PhoR is a two-component system originally described as involved in inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport and metabolism under Pi limitation. However, Pho regulon genes also play roles in virulence, motility and biofilm formation, among others. In this paper we report that the absence of a functional PhoB/PhoR caused increased expression of a number of genes from distinct stress response pathways, in Pi abundance. Moreover, we showed, for the first time, that the interrelationship between PhoB-RpoS-(p)ppGpp-poly(P) in V. cholerae, is somewhat diverse from the model of inter-regulation between those systems, described in Escherichia coli. The V. cholerae dependence on PhoB/PhoR for the RpoS mediated stress response and cellular growth under Pi abundance, suggests that this system's roles are broader than previously thought.

"This work reports the maximization of eugenyl acetate production by esterification of essential oil of clove in a solvent-free system using Novozym 435 as catalyst. The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of clove essential oil and eugenyl acetate produced were determined. The conditions that maximized eugenyl acetate production were 60 A degrees C, essential oil of clove to acetic anhydride ratio of 1:5, 150 rpm, and 10 wt% of enzyme, with a conversion of 99.87 %. A kinetic study was performed to assess the influence of substrates' molar ratio, enzyme concentration, and temperature on product yield. Results show that an excess of anhydride, enzyme concentration of 5.5 wt%, 50 A degrees C, and essential oil of clove to acetic anhydride ratio of 1:5 afforded nearly a complete conversion after 2 h of reaction. Comparing the antibacterial activity of the essential oil of clove before and after esterification, we observed a decrease in the antimicrobial activity of eugenyl acetate, particularly with regard to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Both eugenyl acetate and clove essential oil were most effective to the gram-negative than gram-positive bacteria group. The results showed a high antioxidant potential for essential oil before and particularly after the esterification reaction thus becoming an option for the formulation of new antioxidant products.",0
"This study was conducted to investigate the toxic effects of aflatoxins and the efficacy of Bacillus subtilis ANSB060 for the amelioration of aflatoxicosis in broiler chickens. Six replicates of ten broilers each were assigned to one of seven dietary treatments, which were labeled CO (basal diet); MO (basal diet containing moldy peanut meal); C500 and C1000 (C0 + 500 or 1000 g/t aflatoxin biodegradation preparations, composed mainly of ANSB060); and M500, M1000 and M2000 (MO + 500, 1000 or 2000 g/t aflatoxin biodegradation preparations). The concentrations of aflatoxin B-1, B-2, G(1) and G(2) in the moldy diets (M0, M500, M100 and M2000) fluctuated around 70.7 +/- 1.3, 11.0 +/- 1.5, 6.5 +/- 0.8 and 2.0 +/- 0.3 mu g/kg, respectively. The results showed that the MO diet caused a significant decrease in average daily weight gain and increased feed requirements, with a gain ratio increasing from d 8 to 42, deterioration in meat quality and aflatoxin residues in broilers' livers as compared with the CO diet. The addition of ANSB060 to the aflatoxin-contaminated diets offset these negative effects, leading to the conclusion that ANSB060 has a protective effect on growth performance and meat quality while reducing the amount of aflatoxin residues in the livers of broilers fed naturally moldy peanut meal.

"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Enantia polycarpa (PC) Engl. Et Diels (Annonaceae) is used in traditional medicine as an antimalarial remedy in Southern Nigeria. Aim of the study: The antimalarial activities of ethanolic stem bark extracts of Enantia polycarpa was studied in vivo, in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei berghei. Materials and methods: The ethanolic stem bark extract of Enantia polycarpa was administered at doses ranging from 200 to 600 mg/kg/day to Plasmodium berghei infected mice in both early and established models of antiplasmodial studies. Results: The extract of Enantia polycarpa exhibited promising antimalarial activity against both early and established infections. At a dose of 600 mg/kg the extract achieved a 75.8% and 72% chemosuppression of parasitaemia in the study of acute and established infections, respectively. The extract also prolonged mean survival time of Plasmodium berghei infected mice during the study of established infection. The mean survival time of mice administered Enantia polycarpa extract at 600 mg/kg/day (27 days) was significantly longer than infected/untreated control (12 days). For the acute toxicity study the extract had an intraperitoneal LD50 of 186 mg/kg but caused no mortality when administered orally at doses as high as 2,000 and 4,000 mg/kg. Conclusions: Collectively, the results indicate that Enantia polycarpa is safe when administered orally and possesses promising antimalarial activity, thus supporting its use in traditional medicine for the treatment of malaria.

"Six bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus polymyxa, Bacillus circulans, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas fluorescens 2 and Pseudomonas fluorescens 8) and one fungal isolate (Trichoderma harzianum) were tested for their ability to protect Cucumis sativus L. cv. Beith Alpha against the disease development of Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus (CMV). Seed treatment with individual bacterial and fungal liquid cultures significantly and consistently reduced the disease severity (DS) of infected cucumber plants, after 14 days from CMV inoculation onto cotyledons. All seven biotic inducers reduced the CMV infection at the range of 16.6-39% and 0-46.5% under sterilised and non-sterilised soils, respectively. The effect of treatment with each biotic inducer has a significant difference in the percentage of CMV DS. In sterilised soil, B. circulans has a low percentage of DS (42%), while P. fluorescens 8 has a high DS percentage (62.9%). In non-sterilised soil, the low DS percentage was 30% for T. harzianum, while P. putida had the highest DS percentage (70%). On the other hand, CMV variability on Chenopodium amaranticolor revealed that all biotic treatments differed according to the local lesion number, similarity and morphology.",0
"Probiotics, gut-colonizing microorganisms capable of conferring a number of health benefits to their hosts, are highly desirable as animal feed supplements. Members of the Gram-positive genus Bacillus are often utilized as probiotics, since endospores formed by those bacteria render them highly resistant to environmental extremes and therefore capable of surviving gastrointestinal tract conditions. In this study, 84 distinct bacterial colonies were obtained from bovine chyme and 29 isolates were determined as Bacillus species. These isolates were principally screened for their antimicrobial activity against a group of two Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria, including known human and animal pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Seven strains displaying strong antimicrobial activity against the test cohort were further evaluated for other properties desirable from animal probiotics, including high spore-forming capacity and adhesiveness, resistance to pH extremes and ability to form biofilms. The isolates were found to resist simulated gastrointestinal conditions and most of the antibiotics tested. In addition, plasmid presence was checked and cytotoxicity tests were performed to evaluate the potential risks of antibiotic resistance transfer and unintended pathogenic effects on host, respectively. We propose that the bacterial isolates are suitable for use as animal probiotics.",0
"Cotton plants that are continuously subjected to monoculture suffer greatly from Verticillium wilt disease. The application of a novel bioorganic fertilizer (BOF) consisting of organic fertilizer combined with the antagonistic Bacillus subtilis strain HJ5 significantly suppressed Verticillium wilt of cotton. The disease incidence rates in soils that were treated with BOF (1 %, w/w) in the nursery stage, in the transplanted soil stage or in both stages, decreased by 42.9 %, 57.1 %, and 88.0 %, respectively, compared with controls. B. subtilis HJ5 was tagged with a plasmid-borne gfp gene encoding the green fluorescent protein to investigate its colonization behavior on cotton root surfaces. The results indicated that B. subtilis HJ5 predominantly colonizes the elongation and differentiation zones of the roots and forms micro-colonies in hydroponic and soil systems. The population of B. subtilis HJ5 in the rhizosphere and on cotton roots was also monitored. The number of B. subtilis HJ5 cells on the root surface reached a peak value of approximately 10(7) cfu per gram of roots 3 days after exposure of the cotton seedlings to the bacteria. Probably the colonization of B. subtilis HJ5 on cotton roots is one of the mechanisms involved in protecting cotton plants from fungal infection.",0
"A series of 3-pentyloxy-1-hydroxyxanthone derivatives were synthesized by four-step reactions: first cyclocondensation between salicylic acid and phloroglucinol in the presence of Eaton's reagents, then alkylation with 1,5-dibromopentane, followed by nucleophilic substitution by different nucleophiles to obtain final compounds. Molecular structures of the synthesized compounds were elucidated by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, mass spectral data, and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial activity was evaluated by MIC determination using broth dilution method against representative three Gram-positive and three Gram-negative bacterial strains with reference to ofloxacin. All the synthesized compounds showed antibacterial activity; besides the compounds 7f and 7g showed better Gram-positive and Gram-negative antibacterial activities.",0
"Defective prophages, which are found in the genomes of many bacteria, are unable to complete a viral replication cycle and propagate in their hosts as healthy prophages. They package random DNA fragments derived from various sites of the host chromosome instead of their own genomes. In this study, we characterized a defective phage, PBP180, which was induced from Bacillus pumilus AB94180 by treatment with mitomycin C. Electron microscopy showed that the PBP180 particle has a head with a hexagonal outline of similar to 40 nm in diameter and a long tail. The DNA packaged in the PBP180 head consists of 8-kb DNA fragments from random portions of the host chromosome. The head and tail proteins of the PBP180 particle consist of four major proteins of approximately 49, 33, 16 and 14 kDa. The protein profile of PBP180 is different from that of PBSX, a well-known defective phage induced from Bacillus subtilis 168. A killing activity test against two susceptible strains each of B. subtilis and B. pumilus showed that the defective particles of PBP180 killed three strains other than its own host, B. pumilus AB94180, differing from the host-killing ranges of the defective phages PBSX, PBSZ (induced from B. subtilis W23), and PBSX4 (induced from B. pumilus AB94044). The genome of the PBP180 prophage, which is integrated in the B. pumilus AB94180 chromosome, is 28,205 bp in length, with 40 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Further genomic comparison of prophages PBP180, PBSX, PBSZ and other PBSX-like prophage elements in B. pumilus strains revealed that their overall architectures are similar, but significant low homology exists in ORF29-ORF38, which presumably encode tail fiber proteins involved in recognition and killing of susceptible strains.",0
"Bacteriophages co-exist and co-evolve with their hosts in natural environments. Virulent phages lyse infected cells through lytic cycles, whereas temperate phages often remain dormant and can undergo lysogenic or lytic cycles. In their lysogenic state, prophages are actually part of the host genome and replicate passively in rhythm with host division. However, prophages are far from being passive residents: they can modify or bring new properties to their host. In this review, we focus on two important phage-encoded recombination mechanisms, i.e. site-specific recombination and homologous recombination, and how they remodel bacterial genomes.",0
"Salinity and heavy metal stress are challenging problems in agriculture. Here we report the plant growth promoting ability of three moderate halophiles, Halobacillus sp. ADN1, Halomonas sp. MAN5, and Halobacillus sp. MAN6, in presence of both salinity and heavy metal stress. Halobacillus sp. ADN1, Halomonas sp. MAN5, and Halobacillus sp. MAN6 can tolerate 25, 21, and 29% NaCl, respectively and grow in presence of 1 mM cobalt, cadmium, and nickel and 0.04 mM mercury and 0.03 mM silver. Halobacillus sp. ADN1, Halomonas sp. MAN5, and Halobacillus sp. MAN6 produced 152.5, 95.3, and 167.3 mu g/ml indole acetic acid (IAA) and could solubilize 61, 53, and 75 parts per million (ppm) phosphate, respectively in the presence of 15% NaCl. The production of IAA and solubilization of phosphate was well retained in the presence of salinity and heavy metals like 1 mM cadmium, 0.7 mM nickel, 0.04 mM mercury, and 0.03 mM silver. Besides, the strains showed amylase and protease activities and could produce hydrogen cyanide and ammonia in presence of salinity and heavy metals. A mixture of three strains enhanced the root growth of Sesuvium portulacastrum under saline and heavy metal stress, where the root length increased nearly 4.5 +/- 0.6 times and root dry weight increased 5.4 +/- 0.5 times as compared to control. These strains can thus be useful in microbial assisted phytoremediation of polluted saline soils.",0
"As both a commensal and a major cause of healthcare-associated infections in humans, Enterococcus faecalis is a remarkably adaptable organism. We investigated how E. faecalis adapts in a mammalian host as a pathogen by characterizing changes in the transcriptome during infection in a rabbit model of subdermal abscess formation using transcriptional microarrays. The microarray experiments detected 222 and 291 differentially regulated genes in E. faecalis OG1RF at two and eight hours after subdermal chamber inoculation, respectively. The profile of significantly regulated genes at two hours post-inoculation included genes involved in stress response, metabolism, nutrient acquisition, and cell surface components, suggesting genome-wide adaptation to growth in an altered environment. At eight hours post-inoculation, 88% of the differentially expressed genes were down-regulated and matched a transcriptional profile consistent with a (p) ppGpp-mediated stringent response. Subsequent subdermal abscess infections with E. faecalis mutants lacking the (p) ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase RSH, the small synthetase RelQ, or both enzymes, suggest that intracellular (p) ppGpp levels, but not stringent response activation, influence persistence in the model. The ability of cells to synthesize (p) ppGpp was also found to be important for growth in human serum and whole blood. The data presented in this report provide the first genome-wide insights on E. faecalis in vivo gene expression and regulation measured by transcriptional profiling during infection in a mammalian host and show that (p) ppGpp levels affect viability of E. faecalis in multiple conditions relevant to mammalian infection. The subdermal abscess model can serve as a novel experimental system for studying the E. faecalis stringent response in the context of the mammalian immune system.",0
"The advantages offered by established antibiotics in the treatment of infectious diseases are endangered due to the increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. This leads to a need for new antibacterial compounds. Recently, we discovered a series of compounds termed lipophosphonoxins (LPPOs) that exhibit selective cytotoxicity towards Gram-positive bacteria that include pathogens and resistant strains. For further development of these compounds, it was necessary to identify the mechanism of their action and characterize their interaction with eukaryotic cells/organisms in more detail. Here, we show that at their bactericidal concentrations LPPOs localize to the plasmatic membrane in bacteria but not in eukaryotes. In an in vitro system we demonstrate that LPPOs create pores in the membrane. This provides an explanation of their action in vivo where they cause serious damage of the cellular membrane, efflux of the cytosol, and cell disintegration. Further, we show that (i) LPPOs are not genotoxic as determined by the Ames test, (ii) do not cross a monolayer of Caco-2 cells, suggesting they are unable of transepithelial transport, (iii) are well tolerated by living mice when administered orally but not peritoneally, and (iv) are stable at low pH, indicating they could survive the acidic environment in the stomach. Finally, using one of the most potent LPPOs, we attempted and failed to select resistant strains against this compound while we were able to readily select resistant strains against a known antibiotic, rifampicin. In summary, LPPOs represent a new class of compounds with a potential for development as antibacterial agents for topical applications and perhaps also for treatment of gastrointestinal infections.",0
"Clostridium difficile TcdB harbors a glucosyltransferase that targets host Rho GTPases. However, the role of the enzyme activity in the induction of host intestinal disease has not been demonstrated. In this study, we established a mouse acute intestinal disease model by cecum injection of wild type and glucosyltransferase-deficient TcdB and a chronic model by delivering toxin intraluminally via engineered surrogate host Bacillus megaterium. We demonstrated, for the first time, that the glucosyltransferase activity of TcdB is essential for inducing disease symptoms and intestinal pathological responses that resemble human disease, highlighting the importance of targeting toxin glucosyltransferase activity for future therapy.",0
"Dicoumarols and coumarin derivatives have shown a variety of pharmaceutical activities and have been found to be potent inhibitor for the NAD(P)H-dependent flavoproteins. In this report, dicoumarol and its derivatives containing the substituted benzene ring at the methylenebis position were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. The results showed that the synthesized dicoumarols affect cell growth but are selective against gram-positive over gram-negative bacterial cells. However, for most derivatives, the substitution of steric bulky benzene group on the methylenebis position appears to decrease in the efficacy of antibacterial effect. This finding is roughly described by the predicted poorer docked structure of the derivatives to a homology model of S. aureus flavoprotein. 3D-QSAR study highlighted structural features around the substituted benzene ring of dicoumarols as the antibacterial activity. CoMFA and CoMSIA contour maps support the idea that steric repulsion at the para position could diminish the antibacterial activity. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for the antibacterial activity of dicoumarols.",0
"Fluorescent proteins and developments in superresolution (nanoscopy) and single-molecule techniques bring high sensitivity, speed, and one order of magnitude gain in spatial resolution to live-cell imaging. These technologies have only recently been applied to prokaryotic cell biology, revealing the exquisite subcellular organization of bacterial cells. Here, we review the parallel evolution of fluorescence microscopy methods and their application to bacteria, mainly drawing examples from visualizing actin-like MreB proteins in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We describe the basic principles of nanoscopy and conventional techniques and their advantages and limitations to help microbiologists choose the most suitable technique for their biological question. Looking ahead, multidimensional live-cell nanoscopy combined with computational image analysis tools, systems biology approaches, and mathematical modeling will provide movie-like, mechanistic, and quantitative description of molecular events in bacterial cells.",0
"Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium, is a major cause of nosocomial infections such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Spores are the vector of its transmission and persistence in the environment. Despite the importance of spores in the infectious cycle of C.difficile, little was known until recently about the control of spore development in this enteropathogen. In this review, we describe recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory network controlling C.difficile sporulation. The comparison with the model organism Bacillus subtilis highlights major differences in the signaling pathways between the forespore and the mother cell and a weaker connection between morphogenesis and gene expression. Indeed, the activation of the SigE regulon in the mother cell is partially independent of SigF although the forespore protein SpoIIR, itself partially independent of SigF, is essential for pro-SigE processing. Furthermore, SigG activity is not strictly dependent on SigE. Finally, SigG is dispensable for SigK activation in agreement with the absence of a pro-SigK sequence. The excision of the C.difficile skin element is also involved in the regulation of SigK activity. The C.difficile sporulation process might be a simpler, more ancestral version of the program characterized for B.subtilis.",0
"The indigenous people from Limpopo regard herbal remedies as the most effective way of treating Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs). There are several herbal remedies that they use for various purposes. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of a popular herbal remedy used to treat STIs by testing for its antimicrobial activity, enzyme inhibition against HIV-type 1 reverse-transcriptase (HIV-RT) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2). The safety of the remedy was evaluated by testing for its mutagenic and anti-mutagenic effects. The herbal remedy evaluated in this study was manufactured by a traditional healer from Madiwana village in Limpopo province, South Africa. The mixture was derived from nine plant species, which were also evaluated individually. The herbal remedy was evaluated for its antimicrobial properties against two Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), three Gram-negative (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria and a fungus, Candida albicans. It was assessed for its pharmacological and genotoxicity properties. The extracts of the nine plant species were evaluated in the antigonococcal bioassay only. The herbal remedy exhibited moderate activity against N. gonorrhoeae (66%) but showed good activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus with MIC values ranging from 0.78 to 1.56 mg/ml. The mixture exhibited low antifungal activity against C. albicans. The remedy exhibited insignificant and moderate activities against COX-2 and HIV-RT respectively. The remedy was non-mutagenic. Acetone extracts of Catharanthus roseus, Senna italica, Gomphocarpus fruticosus and Solanum panduriforme showed the best antigonoccol activity >70%. The observed activities of the herbal remedy may offer a lead to explore new multi-target drugs against gonorrhoea and other STIs. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Altering zinc bioavailability to bacterial pathogens is a key component of host innate immunity. Thus, the ability to sense and adapt to the alterations in zinc concentrations is critical for bacterial survival and pathogenesis. To understand the adaptive responses of group A Streptococcus (GAS) to zinc limitation and its regulation by AdcR, we characterized gene regulation by AdcR. AdcR regulates the expression of 70 genes involved in zinc acquisition and virulence. Zinc-bound AdcR interacts with operator sequences in the negatively regulated promoters and mediates differential regulation of target genes in response to zinc deficiency. Genes involved in zinc mobilization and conservation are derepressed during mild zinc deficiency, whereas the energy-dependent zinc importers are upregulated during severe zinc deficiency. Further, we demonstrated that transcription activation by AdcR occurs by direct binding to the promoter. However, the repression and activation by AdcR is mediated by its interactions with two distinct operator sequences. Finally, mutational analysis of the metal ligands of AdcR caused impaired DNA binding and attenuated virulence, indicating that zinc sensing by AdcR is critical for GAS pathogenesis. Together, we demonstrate that AdcR regulates GAS adaptive responses to zinc limitation and identify molecular components required for GAS survival during zinc deficiency.",0
"The bacterial cell division protein FtsZ polymerizes in a GTP-dependent manner to form a Z-ring that marks the plane of division. As a validated antimicrobial target, considerable efforts have been devoted to identify small molecule FtsZ inhibitors. We recently discovered the chrysophaentins, a novel suite of marine natural products that inhibit FtsZ activity in vitro. These natural products along with a synthetic hemi-chrysophaentin exhibit strong antimicrobial activity toward a broad spectrum of Gram-positive pathogens. To define their mechanisms of FtsZ inhibition and determine their in vivo effects in live bacteria, we used GTPase assays and fluorescence anisotropy to show that hemi-chrysophaentin competitively inhibits FtsZ activity. Furthermore, we developed a model system using a permeable Escherichia coli strain, envA1, together with an inducible FtsZ-yellow fluorescent protein construct to show by fluorescence microscopy that both chrysophaentin A and hemi-chrysophaentin disrupt Z-rings in live bacteria. We tested the E. coli system further by reproducing phenotypes observed for zantrins Z1 and Z3, and demonstrate that the alkaloid berberine, a reported FtsZ inhibitor, exhibits auto-fluorescence, making it incompatible with systems that employ GFP or YFP tagged FtsZ. These studies describe unique examples of nonnucleotide, competitive FtsZ inhibitors that disrupt FtsZ in vivo, together with a model system that should be useful for in vivo testing of FtsZ inhibitor leads that have been identified through in vitro screens but are unable to penetrate the Gram-negative outer membrane.

"Many studies have shown that several Greek ecosystems inhabit very interesting bacteria with biotechnological properties. Therefore Streptomyces isolates from diverse Greek habitats were selected for their antifungal activity against the common phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum. The isolate encoded ACTA1551, member of Streptomyces genus, could strongly suppress the fungal growth when examined in antagonistic bioassays in vitro. The isolate was found phylogenetically relative to Streptomyces rochei after analyzing its 16S rDNA sequence. The influence of different environmental conditions, such as medium composition, temperature, and pH on the expression of the antifungal activity was thoroughly examined. Streptomyces rochei ACTA1551 was able to protect tomato seeds from F. oxysporum infection in vivo while it was shown to promote the growth of tomato plants when the pathogen was absent. In an initial effort towards the elucidation of the biochemical and physiological nature of ACTA1551 antifungal activity, extracts from solid streptomycete cultures under antagonistic or/and not antagonistic conditions were concentrated and fractionated. The metabolites involved in the antagonistic action of the isolate showed to be more than one and produced independently of the presence of the pathogen. The above observations could support the application of Streptomyces rochei ACTA1551 as biocontrol agent against F. oxysporum.",0
"Lactococcal siphophages from the 936 and P335 groups infect the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis using receptor binding proteins (RBPs) attached to their baseplate, a large multiprotein complex at the distal part of the tail. We have previously reported the crystal and electron microscopy (EM) structures of the baseplates of phages p2 (936 group) and TP901-1 (P335 group) as well as the full EM structure of the TP901-1 virion. Here, we report the complete EM structure of siphophage p2, including its capsid, connector complex, tail, and baseplate. Furthermore, we show that the p2 tail is characterized by the presence of protruding decorations, which are related to adhesins and are likely contributed by the major tail protein C-terminal domains. This feature is reminiscent of the tail of Escherichia coli phage lambda and Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 and might point to a common mechanism for establishing initial interactions with their bacterial hosts. Comparative analyses showed that the architecture of the phage p2 baseplate differs largely from that of lactococcal phage TP901-1. We quantified the interaction of its RBP with the saccharidic receptor and determined that specificity is due to lower k(off) values of the RBP/saccharidic dissociation. Taken together, these results suggest that the infection of L. lactis strains by phage p2 is a multistep process that involves reversible attachment, followed by baseplate activation, specific attachment of the RBPs to the saccharidic receptor, and DNA ejection.",0
"Toxin/antitoxin (TA) systems perhaps enable cells to reduce their metabolism to weather environmental challenges although there is little evidence to support this hypothesis. Escherichia coliGhoT/GhoS is a TA system in which toxin GhoT expression is reduced by cleavage of its messenger RNA (mRNA) by antitoxin GhoS, and TA system MqsR/MqsA controls GhoT/GhoS through differential mRNA decay. However, the physiological role of GhoT has not been determined. We show here through transmission electron microscopy, confocal microscopy and fluorescent stains that GhoT reduces metabolism by damaging the membrane and that toxin MqsR (a 5-GCU-specific endoribonuclease) causes membrane damage in a GhoT-dependent manner. This membrane damage results in reduced cellular levels of ATP and the disruption of proton motive force (PMF). Normally, GhoT is localized to the pole and does not cause cell lysis under physiological conditions. Introduction of an F38R substitution results in loss of GhoT toxicity, ghost cell production and membrane damage while retaining the pole localization. Also, deletion of ghoST or ghoT results in significantly greater initial growth in the presence of antimicrobials. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GhoT reduces metabolism by reducing ATP and PMF and that this reduction in metabolism is important for growth with various antimicrobials.",0
"Bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) is an intracellular second messenger that regulates adaptation processes, including biofilm formation, motility, and virulence in Gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we have characterized the core components of a c-di-GMP signaling pathway in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Specifically, we have directly identified and characterized three active diguanylate cyclases, DgcP, DgcK, and DgcW (formerly YtrP, YhcK, and YkoW, respectively), one active c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, PdeH (formerly YuxH), and a cyclic-diguanylate (c-di-GMP) receptor, DgrA (formerly YpfA). Furthermore, elevation of c-di-GMP levels in B. subtilis led to inhibition of swarming motility, whereas biofilm formation was unaffected. Our work establishes paradigms for Gram-positive c-di-GMP signaling, and we have shown that the concise signaling system identified in B. subtilis serves as a powerful heterologous host for the study of c-di-GMP enzymes from bacteria predicted to possess larger, more-complex signaling systems.",1
"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread in various ecosystems and are pollutants of great concern due to their potential toxicity, mutagenecity and carcinogenicity. Surfactant has become a hot topic for its wide application in the bioremediation of PAHs. The aim of this work is to explore a microcalorimetric method to determine the toxic effect of pyrene on Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and the PAH-degrading bacteria Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) and to evaluate the effect of Tween 80 on biodegradation of pyrene. Power-time curves were studied and calorimetric parameters including the growth rate constant (k), half inhibitory concentration (IC50), and total thermal effect (Q(T)) were determined. B. subtilis, B. cepacia and B. cepacia with Tween 80 were completely inhibited when the concentration of pyrene were 200, 800 and 1600 mu g mL(-1), respectively. B. cepacia shows better tolerance to pyrene than B. subtilis. Tween 80 significantly improves the biodegradation of pyrene by increasing the bioavailability of pyrene. In addition, the expression of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C230) in B. cepacia is responsible for the degradation of pyrene and plays an important role in improving the biodegradation of pyrene. Moreover, the activity of C23O increases with the application of Tween 80. The enhanced bioavailability and biodegradation of pyrene by Tween 80 shows the potential use of Tween 80 in the PAHs bioremediation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"In the present study, antibacterial activity of the whole plant methanolic extract of Ranunculus muricatus L., was analyzed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus pumilus, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Methanol was regarded as an excellent solvent for antimicrobial activity. It was observed as best bactericidal at a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1-10 mu g/ml against all the bacterial cultures viz. B. pumilus, B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeroginosa and S. typhimurium. Synergistic antibacterial activity of methanolic extracts was tested with respect to solvent extract of leaves of Ricinus communis, Nerium oleander, Withania somnifera, whole plant of Heliotropiaum curassavicum and fruits of Citrullus colocynthis. Synergistical study revealed the best antibacterial activity against B. subtilis and B. pumilus at a level of 1 mu g/ml except E. coli and S. aureus.",0
"The chemical analysis and antibacterial activity of propolis collected from some parts of Western Algeria were investigated. The ethanolic extracts of propolis (EEP) were evaluated for further investigation. The major constituents in EEP were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. All EEP samples were active against Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus), but no activity was found against Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). The mean diameters of growth inhibition of the EEP ranged between 8.05 and 21.4 mm. The propolis extract obtained from Sidi bel Abbes (SFS-SBA) was more active than other samples as well as showed unique HPLC profile. These results support the idea that propolis can be a promising natural food preservative in food industry and alternative candidate for management of bacterial infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms.",0
"Several Leptospira species cause leptospirosis, the most extended zoonosis worldwide. In bacteria, two-component systems constitute key signalling pathways, some of which are involved in pathogenesis. The physiological roles of two-component systems in Leptospira are largely unknown, despite identifying several dozens within their genomes. Biochemical confirmation of an operative phosphorelaying two-component system has been obtained so far only for the Hklep/Rrlep pair. It is known that hklep/rrlep knockout strains of Leptospira biflexa result in haem auxotrophy, although their de novo biosynthesis machinery remains fully functional. Haem is essential for Leptospira, but information about Hklep/Rrlep effector function(s) and target(s) is still lacking. We are now reporting a thorough molecular characterization of this system, which we rename HemK/HemR. The DNA HemR-binding motif was determined, and found within the genomes of saprophyte and pathogenic Leptospira. In this way, putative HemR-regulated genes were pinpointed, including haem catabolism-related (hmuO - haem oxygenase) and biosynthesis-related (the hemA/C/D/B/L/E/N/G operon). Specific HemR binding to these two promoters was quantified, and a dual function was observed in vivo, inversely repressing the hmuO, while activating the hemA operon transcription. The crystal structure of HemR receiver domain was determined, leading to a mechanistic model for its dual regulatory role.",0
"Rhizobacteria and Trichoderma spp. that were antagonistic against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. zingiberi and Pythium splendens inciting rhizome rot disease of ginger were identified. In vitro assays identified positive interactions for growth, antifungal and chitinase gene expression between antagonistic TEPF-Sungal (Burkholderia cepacia) and S2BC-1 (Bacillus subtilis) with S17TH (Trichoderma harzianum), and vice versa. In comparison with the other strains and strain mixtures, one strain mixture, TEPF-Sungal + S17TH, recorded a maximum rhizome production of 84% efficiency with less incidences of yellows and rhizome rot at an 84.2 and 79.7% reduction over the pathogen control, respectively, in a polyhouse with a challenge inoculation with the pathogens. Inoculation of the mixture of biocontrol agents was associated with an increase in known defence gene products such as chitinase etc., so we speculate that these are involved in the mechanism of disease suppression. In field experiments, the strain mixture reduced yellows and rhizome rot to 45.9 and 49.3% over the untreated control, respectively, which is comparatively better than that produced with fungicide (44.3 and 45.3%, respectively). The treatment also produced an increased rhizome yield with an average increase of 60.0% relative to the control. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Recently, global public health organizations such as Doctors without Borders (MSF), the World Health Organization (WHO), Public Health Canada, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the U.S. government developed and deployed Field Decontamination Kits (FDKs), a novel, lightweight, compact, reusable decontamination technology to sterilize Ebola-contaminated medical devices at remote clinical sites lacking infrastructure in crisis-stricken regions of West Africa (medical waste materials are placed in bags and burned). The basis for effectuating sterilization with FDKs is chlorine dioxide (CIO2) produced from a patented invention developed by researchers at the US Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center (NSRDEC) and commercialized as a dry mixed-chemical for bacterial spore decontamination. In fact, the NSRDEC research scientists developed an ensemble of ClO2 technologies designed for different applications in decontaminating fresh produce; food contact and handling surfaces; personal protective equipment; textiles used in clothing, uniforms, tents, and shelters; graywater recycling; airplanes; surgical instruments; and hard surfaces in latrines, laundries, and deployable medical facilities. These examples demonstrate the far-reaching impact, adaptability, and versatility of these innovative technologies. We present herein the unique attributes of NSRDEC's novel decontamination technologies and a Case Study of the development of FDKs that were deployed in West Africa by international public health organizations to sterilize Ebola-contaminated medical equipment. FDKs use bacterial spores as indicators of sterility. We review the properties and structures of spores and the mechanisms of bacterial spore inactivation by ClO2. We also review mechanisms of bacterial spore inactivation by novel, emerging, and established non-thermal technologies for food preservation, such as high pressure processing, irradiation, cold plasma, and chemical sanitizers, using an array of Bacillus subtilis mutants to probe mechanisms of spore germination and inactivation. We employ techniques of high-resolution atomic force microscopy and phase contrast microscopy to examine the effects of 'y-irradiation on bacterial spores of Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Bacillus atrophaeus spp. and of ClO2 on B. subtilis spores, and present in detail assays using spore bio-indicators to ensure sterility when decontaminating with ClO2.",0
"Kin selection could provide an explanation for social behavior in bacteria. The production of public goods such as extracellular molecules is metabolically costly for bacteria but could help them to exploit nutrients or invade a host. Some bacterial cells called social cheaters do not produce public goods; however, they take advantage of these extracellular molecules. In this review, the relationships between social behavior, cooperation, and evolution of bacterial pathogenicity are analyzed. This paper also examines the role of horizontal transfer of genes encoding for virulence factors and how the movement of mobile genetic elements would influence the pathogenicity and social relationships. Moreover, the link between ecological relationships and evolution in entomopathogenic bacteria, focusing on Bacillus thuringiensis is considered. Finally, the findings obtained with B. thuringiensis are extrapolated on Bacillus pumilus 15.1, an entomopathogenic strain whose pathogenicity is not understood yet.",0
"To study the antimicrobial activity of streptomycetes isolated from marine soil, sample in Tamil Nadu. The most potential isolate was identified based on its morphological, cultural, biochemical features and also confirmed by 16s rRNA partial gene sequencing. A total of 50 streptomycetes were subjected to primary screening by cross streak method against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and also by human and plant pathogenic fungi. Putative isolate was subjected to secondary screening by agar well diffusion method to further test the capabilities of primarily screened organisms. The antimicrobial substances were extracted with ethyl acetate from active strain by solvent extraction method. The active isolate showed more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae and candida glabrata. The most potential isolate was identified as Streptomyces coelicolor Strain SU6 (JQ828940). The observations from this study suggest that Streptomyces isolated from marine environment may be potentially used for extracting novel antibiotics for treating both bacterial and fungal infections in human.",0
"A series of substituted N-(quinolin-4-yl)ethanediamine phenyl urea derivatives of biological interest were prepared by sequential quinoline synthesis, chlorination, and substitution reaction followed by reaction of resulting amine with different aryl isocyanates. All synthesized compounds (1-13) were screened for their pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and antimicrobial activity (antibacterial and antifungal). Biological activity evaluation study revealed that among all the compounds screened, compounds 4 and 6 were found to have promising anti-inflammatory activity (up to 78-71 % TNF-alpha and 96-90 % IL-6 inhibitory activity) at a higher concentration of 10 mu M with reference to standard dexamethasone (72 % TNF-alpha and 86 % IL-6 inhibitory activities at 1 mu M). Compounds 6, 8, 10, and 11 overall exhibited promising antimicrobial activity at MIC values ranging from 10 to 30 mu g/mL against all the selected pathogenic bacteria and fungi.",0
"Conspicuously colored dendrobatid frogs possess alkaloid-based antipredator defenses that are sequestered from a diet of arthropods. The type and quantity of alkaloids in dendrobatids vary substantially with geographic location, mainly due to differences in arthropod availability. It has been experimentally demonstrated that some individual alkaloids inhibit the growth of certain microbes, and that different alkaloids vary in their antimicrobial efficacy. We further tested this hypothesis by examining the antimicrobial effectiveness of naturally occurring mixtures of alkaloids (i.e., alkaloid cocktails) isolated from the dendrobatid frog Oophaga pumilio from five different locations in Costa Rica and Panama. Alkaloid cocktails in frogs from these locations varied significantly in their alkaloid composition. Bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and the fungus Candida albicans were subjected to alkaloid cocktails from individual frogs. These antimicrobial susceptibility tests demonstrated significant inhibition of bacterial and fungal growth of cultures incubated with these alkaloids, suggesting that the mixture of alkaloids present naturally in O. pumilio has the potential to defend frogs against natural microbes. Furthermore, there were significant differences in the degree of microbial inhibition among alkaloid cocktails, suggesting that frogs from different locations vary in their defense against microbes.",0
"Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici has been known to cause severe yield losses in tomato. Hence, attempts were made to develop an effective ecofriendly strategy to manage the disease using endophytic and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria. Accordingly, the strains of Bacillus subtilis was tested for its effectiveness against tomato Fusarium wilt under in vitro. Under in vitro conditions B. subtilis EPCO16 was found to effectively inhibit the mycelial growth of the pathogen (46.04%) and promote the growth of tomato seedlings (vigour index: 2311.46) when compared to control. Further, B. subtilis EPCO16 produced a large orange halo in Chrome Azurol Sulphonate (CAS) agar plate assay and the nature of siderophore was Hydroxymate type. The same strain was found to be positive for hydrogen cyanide production and produced volatile compound which effectively inhibited the growth of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici to an extent of 60.78 per cent in vitro. B. subtilis EPCO16 is positive for chitinase, beta-1,3-glucanase and Proteolytic enzyme activity. These findings suggest that B. subtilis EPCO16 can be successfully employed as an eco-friendly strategy for the management of Fusarium wilt of tomato.",0
"Phenylthiourea-formaldehyde polymer (PTF) has been synthesized via polycondensation of phenylthiourea and formaldehyde in basic medium and its corresponding metal complexes [PTF-M(II)] were prepared with Mn(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions. The synthesized polymers have been characterized by elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, UV-visible, FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, ESR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Elemental analysis, electronic spectra and magnetic moment measurement indicate that PTF-Mn(II), PTF-Co(II) and PTF-Ni(II) show octahedral geometry, while PTF-Cu(II) and PTF-Zn(II) show square planar and tetrahedral geometry, respectively. The results of TGA ascribed that all the PTF-M(II) showed better heat-resistance properties than PTF resin. In vitro antimicrobial activities were performed against several bacteria and fungi using agar well diffusion method. The results of microbial activity were compared with Kanamycin and Miconazole as standard antibiotics for antibacterial and antifungal activities respectively. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Labeo rohita fingerlings were fed for 60days with basal diet (BD) or one of the following experimental diets: DI (BD+B. subtilis); DII (BD+B. subtilis+L. plantarum); DIII (BD+B. subtilis+P. aeruginosa) and DIV (BD+B. subtilis+P. aeruginosa+L. plantarum). Various growth and immune parameters were examined at 30 and 60days postfeeding. The fish group fed DIV diet had better improvement (P<0.05) in weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) than the control and other treatment groups. The serum lysozyme activities, alternative complement pathway activity, phagocytic activity and respiratory burst activity in head kidney macrophages of L. rohita increased significantly in the experimental groups throughout the trial period. Superoxide dismutase increased significantly in the experimental groups, except DI fed group, after 60days of feeding. A significant improvement in serum IgM level was observed in the treatment groups at 30days of feeding only. Further, fish fed the DIV diet had highest (P<0.05) postchallenge survival rate (86.6%), followed by DII (73.3%) and DIII (66.6%) against A. hydrophila infection. Considering these promising results, we suggest that a multi-species probiotic supplementation in equal proportions for 60days can effectively improve growth and immunity of L. rohita.",0
"The anaerobic gastrointestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile must form a metabolically dormant spore to survive in oxygenic environments and be transmitted from host to host. The regulatory factors by which C. difficile initiates and controls the early stages of sporulation in C. difficile are not highly conserved in other Clostridium or Bacillus species. Here, we investigated the role of two conserved oligopeptide permeases, Opp and App, in the regulation of sporulation in C. difficile. These permeases are known to positively affect sporulation in Bacillus species through the import of sporulation-specific quorum-sensing peptides. In contrast to other spore-forming bacteria, we discovered that inactivating these permeases in C. difficile resulted in the earlier expression of early sporulation genes and increased sporulation in vitro. Furthermore, disruption of opp and app resulted in greater virulence and increased the amounts of spores recovered from feces in the hamster model of C. difficile infection. Our data suggest that Opp and App indirectly inhibit sporulation, likely through the activities of the transcriptional regulator SinR and its inhibitor, SinI. Taken together, these results indicate that the Opp and App transporters serve a different function in controlling sporulation and virulence in C. difficile than in Bacillus subtilis and suggest that nutrient availability plays a significant role in pathogenesis and sporulation in vivo. This study suggests a link between the nutritional status of the environment and sporulation initiation in C. difficile.",0
"In this study, we induced and purified a novel antimicrobial peptide exhibiting activity against Gram-positive bacteria from the immunized hemolymph of Hermetia illucens larvae. The immunized hemolymph was extracted, and the novel defensin-like peptide 4 (DLP4) was purified using solid-phase extraction and reverse-phase chromatography. The purified DLP4 demonstrated a molecular weight of 4267 Da, as determined using the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) method. From analysis of DLP4 by N-terminal amino acid sequencing using Edman degradation, combined with MALDI-TOF and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR), the amino acid sequence of the mature peptide was determined to be ATCDLLSPFKVGHAACAAHCIA RGKRGGWCDKRAVCNCRK. In NCBI BLAST, the amino acid sequence of DPL4 was found to be 75% identical to the Phlebotomus duboscqi defensin. Analysis of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed that DLP4 have antibacterial effects against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The expression of DLP4 transcripts in several tissues after bacterial challenge was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of the DLP4 gene hardly occurred throughout the body before immunization, but was mostly evident in the fat body after immunization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Shrimp ovarian peritrophin (SOP), a major protein in jelly layer and cortical rods, plays a role in egg protection after spawning. Previous study, sequence of SOP gene from Fenneropenaeus merguiensis (Fm-SOP) was composed of domain A and domain B. The SOP domain A contains amino acid sequences between 1-80 of Fm-SOP. The domain A had six conserved cysteines which have been found in many antimicrobial peptides. The molecular weight of purified rSOP-A protein was about 9 kDa. The SOP domain B contains amino acid sequences 81-329 of Fm-SOP while SOP-B1 was amino acid sequence 182-275 of Fm-SOP. The molecular weight of purified rHis-SOP-B and rHis-SOP-B1 protein were about 38.5 and 18.0 kDa, respectively. Antimicrobial activities of rSOP-A, rHis-SOP-B and rHis-SOP-B1 protein were investigated by liquid growth inhibition assay. Minimal Inhibition Concentration (MIC) of rSOP-A against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Vibrio harveyi, Candida albicans and Fusarium oxysporum were 35, 280, 280, 570 and 15 mu g/mL, respectively. The MIC of rHis-SOP-B against S. aureus, V. harveyi and F. oxysporum were 30, 270 and 500 mu g/mL, respectively. And the MIC of rHis-SOP-B1 against S. aureus, V. harveyi and F. oxysporum were 20, 470 and 250 mu g/mL, respectively. The rHis-SOP-B and rHis-SOP-B1 (1000 mu g/mL) did not show antimicrobial activity against E. coli and C. albicans. Three purified proteins were able to agglutinate V. harveyi in vitro, displayed a chitinase activity and proteinase inhibition. In addition the stability of the proteins was tested and found decrease antimicrobial activity after incubation at 50 degrees C for 5 h.",0
"Endophytic Bacillus subtilis strain E1R-j, isolated from wheat roots, inhibits a wide range of microorganisms. In this study, we determined its inhibitory effect on urediniospore germination of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust and biocontrol effect on the rust development using bacterial cell suspension (BCS) and fermentation liquid with and without bacterial cells (FLBC and FL). Urediniospore germination was significantly inhibited by all three formulations in vitro. The maximum inhibition rate was 84.1% treated with the 10-fold dilution of original formulation of FLBC. Microscopic observation revealed that the bacterial treatments caused urediniospores and germ tubes ruptured, which resulted in protoplasm release and dysfunction of fungal structures. Urediniospore germination was also significantly inhibited by spraying E1R-j on leaf surface before inoculation. Formulations FLBC and FL were both better than formulation BCS. In a condition-controlled greenhouse, application of FLBC and FL 24 and 0 h before Pst inoculation displayed a protective mode in reducing disease severity, and the control efficacy was between 54.0% and 87.7%. For formulation BCS, only the application of 24 h before Pst inoculation significantly reduced rust severity with control efficacy 51.8%. The incidence of diseased leaves in the treatments of FLBC and FL were significantly reduced compared to the non-treated plots in the field experiments conducted in the season 2007-2008. The control efficacy was 51% and 43% for the two treatments, respectively. This study is helpful for further developing a biocontrol approach for managing stripe rust. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Quorum-sensing (QS) peptides are biologically attractive molecules, with a wide diversity of structures and prone to modifications altering or presenting new functionalities. Therefore, the Quorumpeps database (http://quorumpeps.ugent.be) is developed to give a structured overview of the QS oligopeptides, describing their microbial origin (species), functionality (method, result and receptor), peptide links and chemical characteristics (3D-structure-derived physicochemical properties). The chemical diversity observed within this group of QS signalling molecules can be used to develop new synthetic bio-active compounds.",0
"As biofilms grow, resident cells inevitably face the challenge of resource limitation. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, electron acceptor availability affects matrix production and, as a result, biofilm morphogenesis. The secreted matrix polysaccharide Pel is required for pellicle formation and for colony wrinkling, two activities that promote access to O-2. We examined the exploitability and evolvability of Pel production at the air-liquid interface (during pellicle formation) and on solid surfaces (during colony formation). Although Pel contributes to the developmental response to electron acceptor limitation in both biofilm formation regimes, we found variation in the exploitability of its production and necessity for competitive fitness between the two systems. The wild type showed a competitive advantage against a non-Pel-producing mutant in pellicles but no advantage in colonies. Adaptation to the pellicle environment selected for mutants with a competitive advantage against the wild type in pellicles but also caused a severe disadvantage in colonies, even in wrinkled colony centers. Evolution in the colony center produced divergent phenotypes, while adaptation to the colony edge produced mutants with clear competitive advantages against the wild type in this O-2-replete niche. In general, the structurally heterogeneous colony environment promoted more diversification than the more homogeneous pellicle. These results suggest that the role of Pel in community structure formation in response to electron acceptor limitation is unique to specific biofilm models and that the facultative control of Pel production is required for PA14 to maintain optimum benefit in different types of communities.",0
"Two biosurfactants, surfactin and fatty acyl-glutamate, were produced from genetically-modified strains of Bacillus subtilis on 2% glucose and mineral salts media in shake-flasks and bioreactors. Biosurfactant synthesis ceased when the main carbohydrate source was completely depleted. Surfactin titers were similar to 30-fold higher than fatty acyl-glutamate in the same medium. When bacteria were grown in large aerated bioreactors, biosurfactants mostly partitioned to the foam fraction, which was recovered. Dispersion effectiveness of surfactin and fatty acyl-glutamate was evaluated by measuring the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and dispersant-to-oil ratio (OUR). The CMC values for surfactin and fatty acyl-glutamate in double deionized distilled water were 0.015 and 0.10 g/L, respectively. However, CMC values were higher, 0.02 and 0.40 g/L for surfactin and fatty acyl-glutamate, respectively, in 12 parts per trillion (ppt) Instant Ocean (R) sea salt, which has been partly attributed to saline-induced conformational changes in the solvated ionic species of the biosurfactants. The DORs for surfactin and fatty acyl-glutamate were 1:96 and 1:12, respectively, in water. In Instant Ocean (R) solutions containing 12 ppt sea salt, these decreased to 1:30 and 1:4, respectively, suggesting reduction in oil dispersing efficiency of both surfactants in saline. Surfactant toxicities were assessed using the Gulf killifish, Fundulus grandis, which is common in estuarine habitats of the Gulf of Mexico. Surfactin was 10-fold more toxic than fatty acyl-glutamate. A commercial surfactant, sodium laurel sulfate, had intermediate toxicity. Raising the salinity from 5 to 25 ppt increased the toxicity of all three surfactants; however, the increase was the lowest for fatty acyl-glutamate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of plants was screened by disc diffusion assay against four bacteria and four fungal cultures. Streptomycin (10 g/disc) and nystatin (10 g/disc) are used as standards for bacteria and fungi respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts was evaluated through micro broth dilution method. The antimicrobial potency of plant extracts was assessed by their zone of inhibition and activity index values. Total activity of extracts was evaluated to quantitatively compare the activity of two plants. Methanolic extract of Cleome gynandra showed maximum antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (IZ-22 +/- 0.22 mm, AI-0.917, MIC- 0.039 mg/mL, MBC- 0.039 mg/mL). Maximum antifungal potential was shown by C. chelidonii against Candida albicans (IZ-25 +/- 0.92 mm, AI-1.000, MIC- 0.039 mg/mL, MFC- 0.039 mg/mL). Both the extracts exhibited good antimicrobial activity with low range of MIC.",0
"Previous studies have shown that the transcriptional regulator PsaR regulates the expression of the PsaR regulon consisting of genes encoding choline binding protein (PcpA), the extracellular serine protease (PrtA), and the Mn2+-uptake system (PsaBCA), in the presence of manganese (Mn2+), zinc (Zn2+), and cobalt (Co2+). In this study, we explore the Ni2+-dependent regulation of the PsaR regulon. We have demonstrated by qRT-PCR analysis, metal accumulation assays, beta-galactosidase assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays that an elevated concentration of Ni2+ leads to strong induction of the PsaR regulon. Our ICP-MS data show that the Ni2+-dependent expression of the PsaR regulon is directly linked to high, cell-associated, concentration of Ni2+, which reduces the cell-associated concentration of Mn2+. In vitro studies with the purified PsaR protein showed that Ni2+ diminishes the Mn2+-dependent interaction of PsaR to the promoter regions of its target genes, confirming an opposite effect of Mn2+ and Ni2+ in the regulation of the PsaR regulon. Additionally, the Ni2+-dependent role of PsaR in the regulation of the PsaR regulon was studied by transcriptome analysis.",0
"A novel series of 1-N-substituted-3-(4-(5-(pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-ylthio)quinazol in-6-yl)urea/thiourea derivatives (6a-6r) and 1-N-substituted-3-(7-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-4-(5-(pyridin-3-yl)-1,3,4- oxadiazol-2-ylthio)quinazolin-6-yl)urea/thiourea derivatives (14a-14s) were synthesized and screened for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Biological results indicated that the synthesized compounds showed a broad-spectrum activity against tested microorganisms at MIC values between 6.25 and 100 mu g/mL. Compound 6r showed a broad spectrum of activity and was found to be active against all tested species. A quantitative structure-activity relationship study has been carried out on the synthesized compounds to get better insights into pharmacophoric features responsible for the antibacterial activity. Genetic function approximation technique was used to identify descriptors that influence biological activity. Hydrophobic (AlogP98), electronic (atomic polarizability), and topological (radius of gyration) descriptors were found to affect the activity significantly. Generated model was found to be statistically significant (r (2) = 0.86, predictive index = 0.96) and predictive as indicated by very low residuals in internal and external cross-validation.",0
"The (p) ppGpp synthetase RelA contributes to stress adaptation and virulence in Enterococcus faecalis V583. A 2-dimensional electrophoresis proteomic analysis of 2 relA mutants, i.e., Delta relA carrying a complete deletion of the relA gene, and Delta relAsp that is deleted from only its 3' extremity, showed that 31 proteins were deregulated in 1 or both of these mutants. Mass spectrometry identification of these proteins showed that 10 are related to translation, including 5 ribosomal proteins, 3 proteins involved in translation elongation, and 2 proteins in tRNA synthesis; 14 proteins are involved in diverse metabolisms and biosynthesis (8 in sugar and energy metabolisms, 2 in fatty acid biosynthesis, 2 in amino acid biosynthesis, and 2 in nucleotide metabolism). Five proteins were relevant to the adaptation to different environmental stresses, i.e., SodA and a Dps family protein, 2 cold-shock domain proteins, and Ef1744, which is a general stress protein that plays an important role in the response to ethanol stress. The potential role of these proteins in the development of stress phenotypes associated with these mutations is discussed.",0
"Glyoxalase I which is synonymously known as lactoylglutathione lyase is a critical enzyme in methylglyoxal (MG) detoxification. We assessed the STM3117 encoded lactoylglutathione lyase (Lgl) of Salmonella Typhimurium, which is known to function as a virulence factor, due in part to its ability to detoxify methylglyoxal. We found that STM3117 encoded Lgl isomerises the hemithioacetal adduct of MG and glutathione (GSH) into S-lactoylglutathione. Lgl was observed to be an outer membrane bound protein with maximum expression at the exponential growth phase. The deletion mutant of S. Typhimurium (lgl) exhibited a notable growth inhibition coupled with oxidative DNA damage and membrane disruptions, in accordance with the growth arrest phenomenon associated with typical glyoxalase I deletion. However, growth in glucose minimal medium did not result in any inhibition. Endogenous expression of recombinant Lgl in serovar Typhi led to an increased resistance and growth in presence of external MG. Being a metalloprotein, Lgl was found to get activated maximally by Co2+ ion followed by Ni2+, while Zn2+ did not activate the enzyme and this could be attributed to the geometry of the particular protein-metal complex attained in the catalytically active state. Our results offer an insight on the pivotal role of the virulence associated and horizontally acquired STM3117 gene in non-typhoidal serovars with direct correlation of its activity in lending survival advantage to Salmonella spp.",0
"Five isolates of Trichoderma viride, two isolates of Beauveria bassiana, one isolate of Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas sp. were screened against Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans for their antagonistic potentiality by dual culture plate method. Three isolates of T. viride and one isolate of B. bassiana were class-1 antagonists. Among the class-1 antagonists, T10 isolate of T. viride showed best hyperparasitic activity. Both B. subtilis and Pseudomonas sp. strongly inhibited the growth of mycelium and spore germination of the pathogen. The non-volatile metabolites of B. subtilis and Pseudomonas sp. exhibited 72 and 79.50% of inhibition of radial growth, respectively and 82 and 95% of inhibition of growth (dry weight), respectively. Non-volatile metabolites of both bacteria also inhibited spore germination. Volatile metabolites of both bacteria were tested against both radial growth and spore germination of the pathogen and they inhibited them. Therefore, this in vitro study strongly suggested that T. viride, B. subtilis and Pseudomonas sp. can be applied in field trial (in vivo) as effective biocontrol agents, against panicle malformation (F. moniliforme var. subglutinans) of mango.",0
"Ralstonia solanacearum, is a known soil-borne pathogen and causative agent of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) bacterial wilt (TBW) worldwide. In this study, we evaluated the effect of different biocontrol agent inoculants on TBW and rhizosphere microbial communities. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain ZM9 was selected for its antagonistic characteristics against this pathogen in vitro and its ability to colonize crops in pot-based experiments. ZM9 was effective in the control of TBW, and its effects on the tobacco rhizosphere microbial community were accessed using liquid-state fermentation cultures (LSFC) and solid-state fermentation cultures (SSFC) methods. The biocontrol efficacy of LSFC and SSFC groups was increased by 23.51% and 38.20%, respectively compared to the control group. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from the tobacco rhizosphere revealed the tobacco rhizosphere communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes and Actinobacteria, and the relative abundance of R. solanacearum decreased in the biocontrol groups relative to the control group, and was negatively correlated with the abundance of ZM9. The dominant OTUs affiliated with Sphingosinicella, Gemmatimonas and Gp1 with a negative correlation to the abundance of Ralstonia, were the beneficial bacteria for TBW control. In addition, the relative abundance of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria increased in both biocontrol groups. These results suggest an antagonistic effect of ZM9 on bacterial wilt pathogen, thereby highlighting the application of this strain and other potential biocontrol agents for controlling TBW in the field.

"In response to chemical communication, bacterial cells often organize themselves into complex multicellular communities that carry out specialized tasks. These communities are frequently referred to as biofilms, which involve the collective behavior of different cell types. Like cells of multicellular eukaryotes, the biofilm cells are surrounded by self-produced polymers that constitute the extracellular matrix (ECM), which binds them to each other and to the surface. In multicellular eukaryotes, it has been evident for decades that cell-ECM interactions control multiple cellular processes during development. While cells both in biofilms and in multicellular eukaryotes are surrounded by ECM and activate various genetic programs, until recently it has been unclear whether cell-ECM interactions are recruited in bacterial communicative behaviors. In this review, we describe the examples reported thus far for ECM involvement in control of cell behavior throughout the different stages of biofilm formation. The studies presented in this review have provided a newly emerging perspective of the bacterial ECM as an active player in regulation of biofilm development.",0
"Quorum sensing peptides are signalling molecules that are produced by mainly gram-positive bacteria. These peptides can exert different effects, ranging from intra- and interspecies bacterial virulence to bacterial-host interactions. To better comprehend these functional differences, we explored their chemical space, bacterial species distribution and receptor-binding properties using multivariate data analyses, with information obtained from the Quorumpeps database. The quorum sensing peptides can be categorized into three main clusters, which, in turn, can be divided into several subclusters: the classification is based on characteristic chemical properties, including peptide size/compactness, hydrophilicity/lipophilicity, cyclization and the presence of (unnatural) S-containing and aromatic amino acids. Most of the bacterial species synthesize peptides located into one cluster. However, some Streptococcus, Stapylococcus, Clostridium, Bacillus and Lactobacillus species produce peptides that are distributed over more than one cluster, with the quorum sensing peptides of Bacillus subtilis even occupying the total peptide space. The AgrC, FsrC and LamC receptors are only activated by cyclic (thio)lacton or lactam quorum sensing peptides, while the lipophilic isoprenyl-modified peptides solely bind the ComP receptor in Bacillus species. 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Resistance to antibiotics used in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases is a global health problem. More than a decade ago, two-component systems such as WalKR were proposed as ideal targets for the development of new antibiotics. Biochemical screens for WalKR inhibitors using compound libraries have identified many hits, some of which were shown to have non-specific effects. The recently published structures of the S. mutans and B. subtilis WalK provide the opportunity to study inhibitors of WalK autophosphorylation at the atomic level and means to design compounds with improved specificity and affinity using a structure-based approach.",0
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary administration of the live yeast, Rhodotorula sp. C11, on growth and disease resistance against Vibrio splendidus infection in juvenile Japanese spiky sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Sea cucumbers were fed diets containing Rhodotorula sp. C11 at 0 (control), 10(4), 10(5), and 10(6) CFU/g of feed for 45 d. There were three replicate tanks per dietary treatment. The specific growth rates were higher in all sea cucumbers treated with Rhodotorula sp. C11 than in the controls. Following a challenge with V. splendidus NB13, the cumulative prevalence and mortality of sea cucumbers fed diets supplemented with Rhodotorula sp. C11 were lower than in animals fed the basal diet. In sea cucumbers fed diets supplemented with Rhodotorula sp. C11 for 42 d, the only viable yeast found in the intestine was Rhodotorula sp. C11, which had counts of 1.58-1.98 x 10(4) CFU/g. No yeast was isolated from the intestine of animals fed the basal diet. For the colonization study, 20 sea cucumbers from each dietary treatment were removed to separate tanks and fed the control diet from day 16 to day 46. The viable yeast (Rhodotorula sp. C11) counts in the intestine decreased to 60-80 CFU/g by day 37. Moreover, as demonstrated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, Rhodotorula sp. C11 colonization of the intestine could be detected until day 46. The differences in culture and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis may be due to differences in the sensitivity of both methods. The present result showed that Rhodotorula sp. C11 was able to successfully colonize the intestine of juvenile Japanese spiky sea cucumbers by dietary supplementation, which improved its growth and disease resistance.",0
"A novel series of symmetrically substituted 3,3-dibenzy1-4-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinolin-2-ones was synthesized and tested as antimicrobials. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the most active heterocycles were slightly higher than those exhibited by levofloxacin, employed as comparator. Structural factors affecting the activity were explored along three diversification points, including the substituents of the aromatic rings of the 3-benzyl moieties, as well as the functionalization of both, the homocyclic ring of the heterocycle and the quinolonic nitrogen atom. 6-Chloro and 3,3-bis(4'-chlorobenzyl) derivatives showed the lower MIC values. Optimally substituted heterocycles were synthesized, which exhibited enhanced activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",0
"Apple valsa canker (AVC), caused by Valsa mali, is one of the most serious diseases of apple trees in eastern Asia, and the most important factor limiting apple production in China. This disease is difficult to control by chemical and agricultural measures, thus biocontrol may constitute a desirable alternative strategy. A Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain denoted GB1 isolated from ageing cucumber stems, exhibited a strong antagonistic activity against V. mali, inhibiting significantly the germination of conidia and the growth of hyphae. GB1 conidial suspensions (above 10(6) CFU/ml) applied prior to wound inoculation of apple twigs with V. mali resulted in total inhibition of infection. Strain GB1 colonized xylem and phloem tissues surrounding the wounds made on apple twigs and formed biofilms over them. Results indicate that B. amyloliquefaciens GB1 may be a promising agent for the biocontrol of AVC, and provide new insights into the ability of B. amyloliquefaciens to colonize apple trees.(C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Production of 3-phosphorylated RNA by CvfA affects S. aureus virulence gene expression. Results: Disrupting pnpA-encoding exonuclease suppressed the cvfA-deleted mutant phenotype. Purified PNPase did not degrade 3-phosphorylated RNA. Conclusion: CvfA-produced 3-phosphorylated RNA inhibits PNPase-induced RNA degradation, resulting in hemolysin production by S. aureus. Significance: Altering the nucleotide structure at the RNA 3 terminus regulates S. aureus virulence. We previously identified CvfA (SA1129) as a Staphylococcus aureus virulence factor using a silkworm infection model. S. aureus cvfA-deleted mutants exhibit decreased expression of the agr locus encoding a positive regulator of hemolysin genes and decreased hemolysin production. CvfA protein hydrolyzes a 2,3-cyclic phosphodiester bond at the RNA 3 terminus, producing RNA with a 3-phosphate (3-phosphorylated RNA, RNA with a 3-phosphate). Here, we report that the cvfA-deleted mutant phenotype (decreased agr expression and hemolysin production) was suppressed by disrupting pnpA-encoding polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) with 3- to 5-exonuclease activity. The suppression was blocked by introducing a pnpA-encoding PNPase with exonuclease activity but not by a pnpA-encoding mutant PNPase without exonuclease activity. Therefore, loss of PNPase exonuclease activity suppressed the cvfA-deleted mutant phenotype. Purified PNPase efficiently degraded RNA with 2,3-cyclic phosphate at the 3 terminus (2,3-cyclic RNA), but it inefficiently degraded 3-phosphorylated RNA. These findings indicate that 3-phosphorylated RNA production from 2,3-cyclic RNA by CvfA prevents RNA degradation by PNPase and contributes to the expression of agr and hemolysin genes. We speculate that in the cvfA-deleted mutant, 2,3-cyclic RNA is not converted to the 3-phosphorylated form and is efficiently degraded by PNPase, resulting in the loss of RNA essential for expressing agr and hemolysin genes, whereas in the cvfA/pnpA double-disrupted mutant, 2,3-cyclic RNA is not degraded by PNPase, leading to hemolysin production. These findings suggest that CvfA and PNPase competitively regulate RNA degradation essential for S. aureus virulence.",0
"Bacillus Amyloliquefaciens SQR9 is a well-investigated plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria with strong root colonization capability. To identify the key proteins involved in in situ root colonization and biofilm formation, the proteomic profiles of planktonic and root colonized SQR9 cells were compared. A total of 755 proteins were identified, of which 78 and 95 proteins were significantly increased and deceased, respectively, when SQR9 was colonized on the root. The proteins that were closely affiliated with the root colonization belonged to the functional categories of biocontrol, detoxification, biofilm formation, cell motility and chemotaxis, transport, and degradation of plant polysaccharides. A two-component system protein ResE was increased 100-fold when compared to the planktonic status; impairment of the resE gene postponed the formation of cell biofilm and decreased the root colonization capability, which may be regulated through the spo0A-sinI-yqxM pathway. The SQR9 proteomic data provide valuable clues for screening key proteins in the plant-rhizobacteria interaction.",0
"Selenium (Se) has received great attention in the last few years, as it is considered to be essential for human health (prevention of viral infections, heart diseases and ageing-related diseases). Se deficiency can be counteracted by the administration of selenium-enriched probiotics that are able to convert inorganic selenium into less toxic and more bio-available organic forms. This study was performed on Lactobacillus reuteri Lb2 BM DSM 16143, a probiotic LAB previously demonstrated to be able to fix Se into selenocysteines. The aim was to assess Se influence on its metabolism, by a 2-DE proteomic approach, on two different cellular districts: envelope-enriched and extracellular proteomes. While in the envelope-enriched fraction 15 differentially expressed proteins were identified, in the extracellular proteome no quantitative difference was detected. However, at a molecular level, we observed the insertion of Se into selenocysteine, exclusively under the stimulated conditions. The obtained results confirmed the possibility to use L. reuteri Lb2 BM DSM 16143 as a carrier of organic Se that can be easily released in the gut becoming available for the human host.",0
"Plant-derived triterpenoid saponins are involved in the plant defense system by targeting bacterial membranes. A series of ocotillol-type triterpenoid derivatives were synthesized starting from PPD, one of the main components of Panax ginseng and their antibacterial activity against several representative bacteria were evaluated. Compounds 5 and 11 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity with MIC values of 1 mu g/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and 8 mu g/mL and 4 mu g/mL against Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Furthermore, when compounds 5 and 11 were combined with two commercial antibiotics kanamycin and chloramphenicol, they showed strong synergistic activity at sub-MIC levels against S. aureus USA300 and B. subtilis 168. Moreover, chloramphenicol turned from a bacteriostatic to a bactericidal agent when combined with compound 11 against B. subtilis 168.",0
"AimsThis article describes the qualitative and quantitative analyses of untypical compounds in the cuticular and internal lipids of four dipteran species. For isolated compounds, antimicrobial activity against 18 reference strains of bacteria and fungi was determined. Methods and ResultsIn this study, gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse the surface and internal compounds of four fly species. Seven untypical compounds from both pre-imaginal and imaginal stages of examined insects were identified. Azelaic acid (AA) was the most abundant, while phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids occurred in lower concentration. Minor quantities of sebacic acid, 2-methyl-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, tocopherol acetate and trace amounts of 2,4-decadienal were also detected. Tocopherol acetate was found only in cuticular lipids of Musca domestica larvae. Each compound was tested against several species of fungi and bacteria by determining minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Human pathogenic fungi were also investigated. Phenylpropionic acid showed the greatest antifungal activity. Bacterial strains were insensitive to the presence of identified compounds, apart from 2,4-decadienal which strongly inhibited bacterial growth. ConclusionsThis is the first time that the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of untypical compounds in the cuticular and internal lipids of four fly species has been analysed. Significance and Impact of the StudyDetermination of untypical compounds and their antimicrobial activity can effectively contribute to the knowledge concerning insect defence mechanisms.",0
"Radish (Raphanus sativus) is a common cruciferous vegetable, and its aerial parts, called Mu-chung in Korean, have plentiful nutritional components such as vitamins, minerals and dietary fibers. Mu-chung has been used as a kimchi, a traditional Korean fermented dish, and dried Mu-chung is an important component of soups commonly consumed during winter in Korea. Since the advent of the mass production of radish in Korea, with the segregation of farm areas and towns and changing diets, Mu-chung has mostly been discarded instead of utilized. In addition, studies concerning the efficient utilization and useful bioactivities of Mu-chung are still lacking worldwide. In this study, we prepared the ethanol extract of Mu-chung and its subsequent solvent fractions. Antimicrobial, antioxidation, and anticoagulation activities were then evaluated in the hopes of developing a functional biomaterial from Korean radishes' aerial parts. The ethanol extraction yield for hot-air dried Mu-chung was 5.6%, and the fraction yields of n-hexane (H), ethylacetate (EA), butanol (B) and water residue were 25.3, 3.6, 19.4, and 51.7%, respectively. Analysis of total polyphenol and total flavonoid contents showed that the EA fraction had the highest content (97.57 and 152.91 mg/g) amongst the fractions. In antimicrobial activity assays, the H and EA fractions were effective against gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus subtilis), but not effective against gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The B fraction also exhibited moderate antibacterial activity, suggesting that the extract of Mu-chung has various antibacterial components. In antioxidation activity assays, the EA fraction showed strong DPPH, ABTS and nitrite scavenging activities (69-222 mu g/ml of IC50), including reducing power. In anticoagulation activity assays, the EA fraction demonstrated strong inhibition activity against human thrombin and prothrombin. Prominent anticoagulation activity was found in aPTT assays; the aPTT of the EA fraction was extended 15-fold compared than that of the solvent control. Our results suggest that Mu-chung is an attractive nutritional food material possessing useful bioactivities, and the EA fraction of Mu-chung could be developed as a functional food ingredient.",0
"Bacillus subtilis is one of the well-known biofilm-forming organisms associated with plants, animals, and also used as a model organism for all Bacillus sp. In B. subtilis, SrtA enzyme plays the imperative roles in mechanism of signaling pathway and microbial adherence toward the host. SrtA is highly considered as a universal drug target for all Gram positive pathogens. Because of unresolved 3D structure of SrtA in Gram positive bacteria including B. subtilis, we developed a homology model protein using structural alignments of similar SrtA from B. anthracis. While the structural model of SrtA is analyzed because of its significance in biofilm formation by screening the suitable active site based compounds and analyzing the ability of bacterial biofilm inhibition. Druggability site based screening able to retrieve the active compounds against SrtA and checked the activity of the screened compounds through experimental biochemical assays and in situ microscopic analysis. Here in this study we concluded the computationally screened SrtA inhibitors showed high level of biofilm inhibition despite difficulties in bacterial membrane rigidification. Hence this study leads a way to the new compounds that may be useful to treat the bacterial infections Figure Bacillus subtilis is one of the well-known biofilm-forming organisms referred to as model organism for all gram positive pathogens. From this organism, the universal drug target SrtA is evaluated for its biofilm forming ability and inhibitors are screened against the same, through in silico and in vitro methods. Druggability region based SrtA inhibitors are successful by showing anti microbial and anti biofilm activity. This study shows prominent common SrtA inhibitors against the gram positive pathogens",0
"Using sterile test tube potato plants we demonstrated the ability of strains of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis 26D and the fungus Beauveria bassiana Ufa-2 to colonize tissues as an endophytes and enhance transcriptional activity of genes encoding an anionic peroxidase M21334 and proteinase inhibitor SGN-U313509. Endophytic bacteria Bacillus subtilis strain 26D, especially its reinoculate, inhibited the growth of oomycete Phytophthora infestans as well as the Colorado potato beetle endosymbionts Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp. in vitro. In addition, property of the bacteria Bacillus subtilis 26D to induce the expression of proteinase inhibitor gene in plant tissues affect the speed of eating potato plants adults and larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, which then affects their survival. Suggests the possibility of the development of biological products based on strains of bacteria B. subtilis 26D and the fungus Beauveria bassiana Ufa-2 for comprehensive plant protection from late blight and Colorado potato beetle damage.",0
"In this work, the cytotoxicity and toxicity of phosphonium-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with three hydrogen bond donors, namely glycerine, ethylene glycol, and triethylene glycol were investigated. The cytotoxicity effect was tested using brine shrimp (Artemia sauna). The toxicity was investigated using the two Gram positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and two Gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The cytotoxicity of tested DESs was much higher than that of their individual components, indicating their toxicological behavior was different. It was also found that there was toxic effect on the studied bacteria, indicating their potential application as anti-bacterial agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the cytotoxicity and toxicity of phosphonium-based DESs were studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Pathogens are responsible for millions of diseases, disabilities and deaths every year. The ability to control and destroy pathogens is therefore of enormous importance to healthcare, food, drink, water treatment and agriculture, as well as the military. Nanomaterials have potential of wide -ranging industrial, biomedical and electronic applications. Recently, many researchers have been trying to develop nanostructures which can find wide applications for use as Antipathogens. Nanomaterials lay mid way between atomic scale and bulk, having properties different from that of bulk. Biomaterials with nanoscale organizations can be used as controlled-release reservoirs for drug delivery as a promising tool to support cell therapy. Metal-based nanoparticles constitute an effective antimicrobial agent against common pathogenic microorganisms. Some nanoparticles such as silver, gold, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are receiving considerable attention as anti-microbials. Different nanosystems control, kill or disable pathogens differently.",0
"Calnexin (Cnx) is an endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound lectin chaperone that comprises a dedicated maturation system with another lectin chaperone calreticulin (Crt). This maturation system is known as the Cnx/Crt cycle. The main functions of Cnx are Ca2+ storage, glycoprotein folding, and quality control of synthesis. Recent studies have shown that Cnx is important in phagocytosis and in optimizing dendritic cell immunity. However, the functions of Cnx in invertebrate innate immunity remain unclear. In this research, we characterized Cnx in the kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus (designated as MjCnx) and detected its function in shrimp immunity. The expression of MjCnx was upregulated in several tissues challenged with Vibrio anguillarum. Recombinant MjCnx could bind to bacteria by binding polysaccharides. MjCnx protein existed in the cytoplasm and on the membrane of hemocytes and was upregulated by bacterial challenge. The recombinant MjCnx enhanced the clearance of V. anguillarum in vivo, and the clearance effects were impaired after silencing MjCnx with RNA interference assay. Recombinant MjCnx promoted phagocytosis efficiency of hemocytes. These results suggest that MjCnx functions as one of the pattern recognition receptors and has crucial functions in shrimp antibacterial immunity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is a critical cytokine for the initiation of immune responses against a variety of infectious agents and malignancies. We found that a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria stimulated the rapid release (<24 h) of IFN-gamma from murine leukocytes. Using fluorescence activated cell sorting and cd1d(-/-) and rag1(-/-) mice, we determined that dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells were primarily responsible for IFN-gamma release by Streptococcus salivarius, a Gram-positive commensal, previously noted to possess potent interleukin-12 (IL-12)-inducing potential. IFN-gamma release from NK cells required DC: NK membrane contact and IL-12/IL-18 expression, but was independent of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1-mediated interactions. IFN-gamma release in response to bacteria was maintained in mice deficient for Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4, suggesting that bacteria activate antigen-presenting cells via multiple, redundant pathways. Together, our results suggest that Gram-positive bacteria may be useful in driving NK cell activation and T helper 1 polarization and have the potential for development as effective adjuvants.",0
"Phytochemical investigations of the endophytic fungus of an unidentified Ascomycete, isolated from Meliotus dentatus led to the isolation of two new polyketide metabolites named cis-4-acetoxyoxymellein and 8-deoxy-6-hydroxy-cis-4-acetoxyoxymellein. The structures of the two new polyketides were confirmed on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR techniques. Preliminary studies showed that both of the new polyketides displayed strong antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium. cis-4-Acetoxyoxymellein and 8-deoxy-6-hydroxy-cis-4-acetoxyoxymellein also displayed good antifungal and algicidal activities toward Microbotryum violaceum, Botrytis cinerea, and Septoria tritici.",0
"A novel class of substituted pyridyl coumarin derivatives has been synthesized starting from 3-acetyl coumarin and chromone-3-carbaldehyde via one pot reaction and fully characterized by spectral and elemental analysis. All these derivatives 3a-l were screened in vitro for antimicrobial activity against a representative panel of pathogenic strains. Compounds demonstrated good to excellent antibacterial activity, while some compounds exhibited equipotent antifungal activity as compared to that of first line standard drug. As a part of investigation of new antitubercular agents, in vitro screening of synthesized compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv has been done. Among the designed molecules, three compounds showed relatively better activity. From the entire study, it has been revealed that compounds appear to be better antimicrobials but relatively poor antituberculars.",0
"Mutations causing antibiotic resistance usually incur a fitness cost in the absence of antibiotics. The magnitude of such costs is known to vary with the environment. Little is known about the fitness effects of antibiotic resistance mutations when bacteria confront the host's immune system. Here, we study the fitness effects of mutations in the rpoB, rpsL, and gyrA genes, which confer resistance to rifampin, streptomycin, and nalidixic acid, respectively. These antibiotics are frequently used in the treatment of bacterial infections. We measured two important fitness traits-growth rate and survival ability-of 12 Escherichia coli K-12 strains, each carrying a single resistance mutation, in the presence of macrophages. Strikingly, we found that 67% of the mutants survived better than the susceptible bacteria in the intracellular niche of the phagocytic cells. In particular, all E. coli streptomycin-resistant mutants exhibited an intracellular advantage. On the other hand, 42% of the mutants incurred a high fitness cost when the bacteria were allowed to divide outside of macrophages. This study shows that single nonsynonymous changes affecting fundamental processes in the cell can contribute to prolonged survival of E. coli in the context of an infection.",0
"Three novel Zn(II) complexes (1-3) with 1,1'-(anthracen-9-ylmethylene)bis(1H-pyrazole) (L-2) have been prepared and structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. Among them, 1 is a binuclear Zn(II) complex while 2 and 3 are mononuclear. The in vitro cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of these complexes were also evaluated. The three complexes exhibit cytotoxic specificity and significant antitumor activity. The MIC50 value of complex 1 against Pseudomonas putida reaching 0.011 mu g/mL much lower than that the positive control chloromycin (0.182 mu g/mL), indicates that complex 1 is a potent antibacterial agent.

"A set of reaction conditions, including ionic liquids as catalysts, water as solvent and microwave-assisted heating method, had been investigated for the synthesis of hepta- O-acetyl- beta- D- lactosyl thiosemicarbazones. Based on optimized conditions, namely, [HO(CH2)(2)NH3][ OAc] as catalyst, water as solvent and 300 W microwave power, a series of substituted benzaldehyde hepta- O- acetyl- beta- D- lactosyl thiosemicarbazones was synthesized by reaction of hepta- O- acetyl- beta- D- lactosyl thiosemicarbazide with the corresponding substituted benzaldehydes. The high yields of 90- 97% were achieved. Almost all of the obtained thiosemicarbazones exhibited remarkable antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia in comparison with sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim as drug references and antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in comparison with clotrimazole as drug reference. MIC values of the compounds range from 39.1 to 2500 mu g/ mL for bacterial activity and from 0.25 to 25.6 mu g/ mL for fungal activity.",0
"The second messenger cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) plays important roles in growth, virulence, cell wall homeostasis, potassium transport and affects resistance to antibiotics, heat and osmotic stress. Most Firmicutes contain only one c-di-AMP synthesizing diadenylate cyclase (CdaA); however, little is known about signals and effectors controlling CdaA activity and c-di-AMP levels. In this study, a genetic screen was employed to identify components which affect the c-di-AMP level in Lactococcus. We characterized suppressor mutations that restored osmoresistance to spontaneous c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase gdpP mutants, which contain high c-di-AMP levels. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations were identified in the cdaA and gdpP genes, respectively, which led to lower c-di-AMP levels. A mutation was also identified in the phosphoglucosamine mutase gene glmM, which is commonly located within the cdaA operon in bacteria. The glmM I154F mutation resulted in a lowering of the c-di-AMP level and a reduction in the key peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in L. lactis. C-di-AMP synthesis by CdaA was shown to be inhibited by GlmM(I154F) more than GlmM and GlmM(I154F) was found to bind more strongly to CdaA than GlmM. These findings identify GlmM as a c-di-AMP level modulating protein and provide a direct connection between c-di-AMP synthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis.",0
"Group A streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is a strict human pathogen that causes severe, invasive diseases. GAS does not produce catalase, but has an ability to resist killing by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through novel mechanisms. The peroxide response regulator (PerR), a member of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) family, plays a key role for GAS to cope with oxidative stress by regulating the expression of multiple genes. Our previous studies have found that expression of an iron-binding protein, Dpr, is under the direct control of PerR. To elucidate the molecular interactions of PerR with its cognate promoter, we have carried out structural studies on PerR and PerR-DNA complex. By combining crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we confirmed that the determined PerR crystal structure reflects its conformation in solution. Through mutagenesis and biochemical analysis, we have identified DNA-binding residues suggesting that PerR binds to the dpr promoter at the per box through a winged-helix motif. Furthermore, we have performed SAXS analysis and resolved the molecular architecture of PerR-DNA complex, in which two 30 bp DNA fragments wrap around two PerR homodimers by interacting with the adjacent positively-charged winged-helix motifs. Overall, we provide structural insights into molecular recognition of DNA by PerR and define the hollow structural arrangement of PerR-30bpDNA complex, which displays a unique topology distinct from currently proposed DNA-binding models for Fur family regulators.",0
"Vascular wilting in tomato plants constitutes an important group of diseases incited by soil inhabiting pathogens, especially Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, that causes significant production losses. The introgression of genes that express specific resistance is considered the main control method, however, due to the rapid emergence of races that suppress resistance, biocontrol has been presented as an option to be integrated with genetic control methods. This study aimed at evaluating the ability of rhizobacteria isolates, especially from the Bacillus genus, as biological control agents of Fusarium wilt in tomato plants. The laboratory assay was carried out to verify the ability of the isolates in acting as inhibitors of mycelial growth, besides detecting the genes involved in the expression of polypeptides with antimicrobial action. In the greenhouse, the assay comprised of microbiolized seeds and addition of a suspension of propagules of each rhizobacteria to the soil at the moment of transplanting the tomato seedlings. All the rhizobateria isolates showed variable control levels of the pathogen in vitro. The UFG-07 and UFG-10 isolates, with high similarity with Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus circulans, excelled in the disease suppression. PCR results detected target genes for expression of polypeptides, what reinforces the hypothesis of action of antimicrobial substances in biocontrol.",0
"Due to changes in the design of industrial food processing and increasing international trade, highly thermoresistant spore-forming bacteria are an emerging problem in food production. Minimally processed foods and products with extended shelf life, such as milk products, are at special risk for contamination and subsequent product damages, but information about origin and food quality related properties of highly heat-resistant spore-formers is still limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the biodiversity, heat resistance, and food quality and safety affecting characteristics of aerobic spore-formers in the dairy sector. Thus, a comprehensive panel of strains (n = 467), which originated from dairy processing environments, raw materials and processed foods, was compiled. The set included isolates associated with recent food spoilage cases and product damages as well as isolates not linked to product spoilage. Identification of the isolates by means of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular methods revealed a large biodiversity of spore-formers, especially among the spoilage associated isolates. These could be assigned to 43 species, representing 11 genera, with Bacillus cereus s.l. and Bacillus licheniformis being predominant. A screening for isolates forming thermoresistant spores (TRS, surviving 100 degrees C, 20 min) showed that about one third of the tested spore-formers was heat-resistant, with Bacillus subtilis and Geobacillus stearothermophilus being the prevalent species. Strains producing highly thermoresistant spores (HTRS, surviving 125 C, 30 min) were found among mesophilic as well as among thermophilic species. B. subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens were dominating the group of mesophilic HTRS, while Bacillus smithii and Geobacillus pallidus were dominating the group of thermophilic HTRS. Analysis of spoilage-related enzymes of the TRS isolates showed that mesophilic strains, belonging to the B. subtilis and B. cereus groups, were strongly proteolytic, whereas thermophilic strains displayed generally a low enzymatic activity and thus spoilage potential. Cytotoxicity was only detected in B. cereus, suggesting that the risk of food poisoning by aerobic, thermoresistant spore-formers outside of the B. cereus group is rather low. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"The nanopattern on the surface of Clanger cicada (Psaltoda claripennis) wings represents the first example of a new class of biomaterials that can kill bacteria on contact based solely on their physical surface structure. The wings provide a model tor the development of novel functional surfaces that possess an increased resistance to bacterial contamination and infection. We propose a biophysical model of the interactions between bacterial cells and cicada wing surface structures, and show that mechanical properties, in particular cell rigidity, are key factors in determining bacterial resistance/sensitivity to the bactericidal nature of the wing surface. We confirmed this experimentally by decreasing the rigidity of surface-resistant strains through microwave irradiation of the cells, which renders them susceptible to the wing effects. Our findings demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating cicada wing nanopatterns into the design of antibacterial nanomaterials.",0
"The reactions of copper(I) halides, CuX (X=Cl, Br, I) with N-methylbenzothiazole-2-thione (mbtt), independent of the molar ration chosen (1:2 or 1:3), led to the formation of dinuclear complexes of the formula [CuX(mbtt)(2)](2), whereas the reactions of CuX and mbtt in the presence of two equivalents of triphenylphosphine (PPh3) afforded mononuclear mixed-ligand complexes of the formula [CuX(PPh3)(2)( mbtt)]. The molecular structure of a representative compound from each of the two above types of complexes, namely [CuCl(mbtt)(2)](2) and [CuI(PPh3)(2)(mbtt)] have been established by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The new complexes are strongly emissive both in the solid state and in solution. The complexes were also screened for antibacterial activity and their ability to interact with native calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) in vitro. Both types of complexes showed significant activities against all the bacteria tested as compared to that of standard antibiotic ampicillin, however, the three mixed-ligand complexes including triphenylphosphane as ligand exhibited perceptibly stronger antibacterial activity than the three homoleptic ones possessing only the mbtt ligand. DNA electrophoretic mobility experiments showed that all complexes bind to CT-ds DNA resulting in high molecular weight complexes ending in DNA degradation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"Brucella spp. are adept at establishing a chronic infection in mammals. We demonstrate that core components of the alpha-proteobacterial general stress response (GSR) system, PhyR and sigma(E1), are required for Brucella abortus stress survival in vitro and maintenance of chronic murine infection in vivo. Delta phyR and Delta rpoE1 null mutants exhibit decreased survival under acute oxidative and acid stress but are not defective in infection of primary murine macrophages or in initial colonization of BALB/c mouse spleens. However, Delta phyR and Delta rpoE1 mutants are attenuated in spleens beginning 1 month postinfection. Thus, the B. abortus GSR system is dispensable for colonization but is required to maintain chronic infection. A genome-scale analysis of the B. abortus GSR regulon identified stress response genes previously linked to virulence and genes that affect immunomodulatory components of the cell envelope. These data support a model in which the GSR system affects both stress survival and the interface between B. abortus and the host immune system. We further demonstrate that PhyR proteolysis is a unique feature of GSR control in B. abortus. Proteolysis of PhyR provides a mechanism to avoid spurious PhyR protein interactions that inappropriately activate GSR-dependent transcription. We conclude that the B. abortus GSR system regulates acute stress adaptation and long term survival within a mammalian host and that PhyR proteolysis is a novel regulatory feature in B. abortus that ensures proper control of GSR transcription.",0
"A new spectrum of human bacterial and fungal infections is increasing due to the increase of different ailment; AIDS, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease like Alzheimer's patients. The increase use of antibacterial and antifungal agents also resulted in the development of resistance to the present drugs. It make necessary to discover new classes of antibacterial and antifungal compounds to cure the fungal infection. Therefore, research on natural products and isolated a series of two new bioactive compounds Arvense A (1) and Arvense B (2) were isolated from n-butanol soluble fraction of Cirsium arvense along with two know compounds 5,4′- Apigenin 7-O-beta- D-glucoside (3), Dihydroxy-6,7-dimethyoxyflavone 4′- glucoside (4). Their structures have been identified by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), high resolution resonance ionization mass spectrometry (HR-EIMS), 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopic methods. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested; this compound shows profound antimicrobial activities.",0
"A bacterial transcriptome of the primary etiological agent of human dental caries, Streptococcus mutans, is described here using deep RNA sequencing. Differential expression profiles of the transcriptome in the context of carbohydrate source, and of the presence or absence of the catabolite control protein CcpA, revealed good agreement with previously-published DNA microarrays. In addition, RNA-seq considerably expanded the repertoire of DNA sequences that showed statistically-significant changes in expression as a function of the presence of CcpA and growth carbohydrate. Novel mRNAs and small RNAs were identified, some of which were differentially expressed in conditions tested in this study, suggesting that the function of the S. mutans CcpA protein and the influence of carbohydrate sources has a more substantial impact on gene regulation than previously appreciated. Likewise, the data reveal that the mechanisms underlying prioritization of carbohydrate utilization are more diverse than what is currently understood. Collectively, this study demonstrates the validity of RNA-seq as a potentially more-powerful alternative to DNA microarrays in studying gene regulation in S. mutans because of the capacity of this approach to yield a more precise landscape of transcriptomic changes in response to specific mutations and growth conditions.",0
"In the present study, the ability of plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR), Bacillus vallismortis strain BS07 (BS07) was evaluated as one of the potential biocontrol agents against multiple pathogens in chili pepper. Under greenhouse conditions, chili pepper seedlings treated with BS07 or chemical control, benzothiadiazole (BTH) by soil drench suppressed the soft rot incidence significantly by reducing the percent disease lesion area per leaf disk compared to negative control. The treatment with BS07 or BTH induced plant resistance against phytophthora blight caused by Phytophthora capsici upon pathogen challenge. There was a greater reduction of anthracnose infection caused by Colletotrichum acutatum on matured fruits in BS07 or BTH treated plants when compared to untreated control. Under field conditions, percent of soft rot incidence and disease severity of phytophthora blight were significantly reduced in BS07 and BTH treated plants when compared to untreated control. In the case of anthracnose disease, the significant reduction of disease was observed during the two years on matured fruits, when compared to untreated control. The study also clearly showed that there was a significant increase of fruit yield in BS07 treated plants, and it has also been observed that BS07 treated plants showed higher chlorophyll content in the fresh leaves compared to untreated control. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves revealed up-regulation of PR1a gene expression in Col-0, while there was no expression in Nag-G plants treated with BS07 suspensions. This suggests that the systemic resistance might be evolved by the mechanism of salicylic acid (SA) dependent pathway. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Clostridium difficile is the major cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea and colitis in developed countries. The pathogenicity of C. difficile is mainly mediated by the release of 2 large potent exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), both of which require neutralization to prevent disease occurrence. We have generated a novel chimeric protein, designated mTcd138, comprised of the glucosyltransferase and cysteine proteinase domains of TcdB and the receptor binding domain of TcdA and expressed it in Bacillus megaterium. To ensure that mTcd138 is atoxic, 2 point mutations were introduced to the glucosyltransferase domain of TcdB, which essentially eliminates toxicity of mTcd138. Parenteral immunizations of mice and hamsters with mTcd138 induced protective antibodies to both toxins and provided protection against infection with the hyper-virulent C. difficile strain UK6.",0
"Streptococcus pneumoniae is auxotrophic for arginine, and molecular analysis of the pneumococcal genome showed that the gene encoding an arginine-ornithine antiporter (ArcD) is organized in a cluster together with the arcABC genes encoding the arginine deiminase system (ADS) of pneumococci. The ADS consists of the arginine deiminase (AD), the catabolic ornithine carbamoyltransferase (cOCT), and the carbamate kinase (CK). Pneumococcal genomes contain three ArgR-type regulators (ArgR1, ArgR2, and AhrC) that are supposed to be involved in the regulation of arginine metabolism. Here, we identified ArgR2 of TIGR4 as the regulator of the ADS and ArcD. ArgR2 binds to promoter sequences of the arc operon, and the deficiency of ArgR2 in TIGR4 abrogates expression of the ADS, including the arginine-ornithine antiporter ArcD. Intranasal infection of mice and real-time bioimaging revealed that deletion of the arcABCDT genes attenuates TIGR4. However, the acute-pneumonia model and coinfection experiments indicated that the arginine-ornithine antiporter ArcD is essential to maintain fitness, while the deficiency of ADS enzymes has a minor impact on pneumococcal fitness under in vivo conditions. Strikingly, argR2 mutant TIGR4 outcompeted the wild type in the respiratory tract, suggesting an increase in fitness and further regulatory functions of ArgR2. In contrast to TIGR4, other pneumococci, such as D39, lacking expression of ArgR2, constitutively express the ADS with a truncated nonfunctional AD. On the basis of these results, we propose that the arginine-ornithine antiporter is essential to maintain pneumococcal fitness and that the genes of the ADS cluster are positively regulated in a strain-specific manner by ArgR2. IMPORTANCE Pneumococci are the major etiologic agents of community-acquired pneumonia, causing more than 1.5 million deaths annually worldwide. These versatile pathogens are highly adapted to the nutrients provided by the host niches encountered. Physiological fitness is of major importance for colonization of the nasopharyngeal cavity and dissemination during invasive infections. This work identifies the regulator ArgR2 as the activator of the S. pneumoniae TIGR4 ADS and the arginine-ornithine transporter ArcD, which is needed for uptake of the essential amino acid arginine. Although ArgR2 activates ArcD expression and uptake of arginine is required to maintain pneumococcal fitness, the deficiency of ArgR2 increases TIGR4 virulence under in vivo conditions, suggesting that other factors regulated by ArgR2 counterbalance the reduced uptake of arginine by ArcD. Thus, this work illustrates that the physiological homeostasis of pneumococci is complex and that ArgR2 plays a key role in maintaining bacterial fitness.",0
"It is necessary to understand the roles of root exudates involved in plant-microbe interactions to inform practical application of beneficial rhizosphere microbial strains. Colonization of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9 (isolated from cucumber rhizosphere) and Bacillus subtilis N11 (isolated from banana rhizosphere) of their original host was found to be more effective as compared to the colonization of the non-host plant. Organic acids in the root exudates of the two plants were identified by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chemotactic response and effects on biofilm formation were assessed for SQR9 and N11 in response to cucumber and banana root exudates, as well as their organic acids components. Citric acid detected exclusively in cucumber exudates could both attract SQR9 and induce its biofilm formation, whereas only chemotactic response but not biofilm formation was induced in N11. Fumaric acid that was only detected in banana root exudates revealed both significant roles on chemotaxis and biofilm formation of N11, while showing only effects on biofilm formation but not chemotaxis of SQR9. The relationship between PGPR strain and root exudates components of its original host might contribute to preferential colonization. This study advances a clearer understanding of the mechanisms relevant to application of PGPR strains in agricultural production.",0
"Yellow leaf spot is a wide spread diseases of soft and hard wheat. Numerous publications and the authors' own research show that its epiphytotics occur in different countries (Australia, Canada, USA, India, England, Belgium, Romania, Czech Republic, Kazakhstan) with crop losses reaching 65 %. In Russia the disease is most common in the North Caucasus. Development and application of new high-performance environmentally friendly biological products is regarded as one of the most effective biologized approach to wheat protection against the disease. In searching potential bacterial agents for use as protective means, their in vitro antagonistic activity should be accompanied by the ability to provide effective protection for seeds and seedlings. Herein we studied the repression of yellow spot development during early stages of plant vegetation in a greenhouse as influenced by the bacterial strains which were in vitro antagonistic to P. tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechsler. Winter wheat cultivar Bat'ko susceptible to the pathogen was used as test plant. Six isolates of the Bacillus family (Bacillus sp. BZR 18, B. subtilis BZR 336 s, B. subtilis BZR 336 g, B. subtilis BZR 436, B. subtilis BZR 517, B. licheniformis BZR 59), as well as Ochrobactrum sp. BZR 417 from the collection of All-Russian Research Institute of Biological Plant Protection were used as candidate bio agents. For comparison, liquid Fitosporin-M was used as a biological preparation (LLC Scientific Innovation Enterprise ""BashInkom"", Russia) and Prozaro emulsion concentrate was used as a chemical fungicide (""Bayer CropScience"", Germany). Liquid cultures of antagonistic bacterial strains were applied in three modes, namely before inoculation (prophylactic treatment), at early signs of the disease (on the day 3 after inoculation) and by their combination. All treatments were performed with inlaying and without inlaying grain with liquid bacterial culture. All studied bacterial strains except Ochrobactrum sp. BZR 417 showed considerable biological efficacy of leaf spot inhibition. The Bacillus sp. BZR 18 and B. subtilis BZR 517 were the most inhibiting strains which repressed leaf spot development at 68.5 to 83.0 % and 55.6 to 64.0 % rate, respectively, in all variants except treatment at early signs of the infection without inlaying grains when the efficiency was 26.8 and 35.9 %, respectively. B. licheniformis BZR 59 provided for 52.6 to 68.9 % leaf spot inhibition. Liquid culture of B. subtilis BZR 336 g strain ensured efficiency from 51.5 to 58.3 % in all variants except a preventive treatment without inlaying grain when the efficiency was 40.9 %. B. subtilis BZR 336 s, if used at early signs of infection with inlaying grain and in combination of prophylactic treatment with application at early signs of infection and inlaying grain, caused 60.2 and 60.3 % leaf spot repression; in other cases a 14.7 to 44.3 % repression was observed. BZR 436 B. subtilis effectiveness was from 28.4 % under preventive treatment with preliminary grain inlaying to 73.4 % under preventive treatment together with application at early signs of infection and inlaying grain. The efficiency of Ochrobactrum sp. BZR 417 strain does not exceed 45.4 % in all variants. Depending on antifungal activity of the bacterial agent, a combination of grain pre-treatment, prophylactic treatment and treatment at early signs of infection proved to be the most effective.",0
"Aflatoxins are toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic and immunosuppressive byproducts of Aspergillus spp. that contaminate a wide range of crops such as maize, peanut, and cotton. Aflatoxin not only affects crop production but renders the produce unfit for consumption and harmful to human and livestock health, with stringent threshold limits of acceptability. In many crops, breeding for resistance is not a reliable option because of the limited availability of genotypes with durable resistance to Aspergillus. Understanding the fungal/crop/environment interactions involved in aflatoxin contamination is therefore essential in designing measures for its prevention and control. For a sustainable solution to aflatoxin contamination, research must be focused on identifying and improving knowledge of host plant resistance factors to aflatoxin accumulation. Current advances in genetic transformation, proteomics, RNAi technology, and marker-assisted selection offer great potential in minimizing pre-harvest aflatoxin contamination in cultivated crop species. Moreover, developing effective phenotyping strategies for transgenic as well as precision breeding of resistance genes into commercial varieties is critical. While appropriate storage practices can generally minimize post-harvest aflatoxin contamination in crops, the use of biotechnology to interrupt the probability of pre-harvest infection and contamination has the potential to provide sustainable solution.

"Background: Alternative sigma factors are important transcriptional regulators in bacteria. While sigma(B) has been shown to control a large regulon and play important roles in stress response and virulence in the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, the function of sigma(H) has not yet been well defined in Listeria, even though sigma(H) controls a large regulon in the closely related non-pathogenic Bacillus subtilis. Results: Using RNA-seq characterization of a L. monocytogenes strain with deletions of all 4 genes encoding alternative s factors (Delta BCHL), which was further modified to overexpress sigH (Delta BCHL::P-rha-sigH), we identified 6 transcription units (TUs) that are transcribed from sigma(H)-dependent promoters. Five of these TUs had not been previously identified. Identification of these promoters was facilitated by use of a bio-informatics approach that compared normalized RNA-seq coverage (NRC), between Delta BCHL::P-rha-sigH and a Delta BCHL control, using sliding windows of 51 nt along the whole genome rather than comparing NRC calculated only for whole genes. Interestingly, we found that three operons that encode competence genes (comGABCDEFG, comEABC, coiA) are transcribed from sigma(H)-dependent promoters. While these promoters were highly conserved in L. monocytogenes, none of them were found in all Listeria spp. and coiA and its sH-dependent promoter were only found in L. monocytogenes. Conclusions: Our data indicate that a number of L. monocytogenes competence genes are regulated by sH. This sH-dependent regulation of competence related genes is conserved in the pathogen L. monocytogenes, but not in other non-pathogenic Listeria strains. Combined with prior data that indicated a role of sH in virulence in a mouse model, this suggests a possible novel role of sH-dependent competence genes in L. monocytogenes virulence. Development and implementation of a sliding window approach to identify differential transcription using RNA-seq data, not only allowed for identification of sigma(H)-dependent promoters, but also provides a general approach for sensitive identification of differentially transcribed promoters and genes, particularly for genes that are transcribed from multiple promoter elements only some of which show differential transcription.",0
"Synthetic biology applications in biosensing bioremediation, and biomining envision the use of engineered microbes beyond a contained laboratory. Deployment of such microbes in the environment raises concerns of unchecked cellular proliferation or unwanted spread of synthetic genes. While antibiotic resistant plasmids are the most utilized vectors for introducing synthetic genes into bacteria, they are also inherently insecure, acting naturally to propagate DNA from one cell to another. To introduce security into bacterial Chromosome. synthetic biology, we here took on the task of completely reformatting plasmids to be dependent on their intended host strain and inherently disadvantageous for others. Using conditional origins of replication, rich-media compatible auxotrophies, and toxin antitoxin pairs we constructed a mutually dependent host-plasmid platform, called GeneGuard. In this, replication initiators for the R6K or ColE2-P9 origins are provided in trans by a specified host, whose essential thyA or dapA gene is translocated from a genomic to a plasmid location. This reciprocal arrangement is stable for at least 100 generations without antibiotic selection and is compatible for use in LB medium and soil. Toxin genes zeta or Kid are also employed in an auxiliary manner to make the vector disadvantageous for strains not expressing their antitoxins. These devices, in isolation and in concert, severely reduce unintentional plasmid propagation in E coli and R subtilis and do not disrupt the intended E coli hoses growth dynamics. Our GeneGuard system comprises several versions of modular cargo ready vectors, along with their requisite genomic integration cassettes, and is demonstrated here as an efficient vector for heavy-metal biosensors.",0
"Tetracyclines possess many properties considered ideal for antibiotic drugs, including activity against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens, proven clinical safety, acceptable tolerability, and the availability of intravenous (IV) and oral formulations for most members of the class. As with all antibiotic classes, the antimicrobial activities of tetracyclines are subject to both class-specific and intrinsic antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. Since the discovery of the first tetracyclines more than 60 years ago, ongoing optimization of the core scaffold has produced tetracyclines in clinical use and development that are capable of thwarting many of these resistance mechanisms. New chemistry approaches have enabled the creation of synthetic derivatives with improved in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy, ensuring that the full potential of the class can be explored for use against current and emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, MDR Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",0
"For many pathogenic microbes, biofilm formation is a critical component of the disease cycle and is required for pathogenicity or full virulence. Recent innovation in in vitro biofilm reactors has allowed high throughput evaluation and testing of chemical treatments against microbial biofilms. For example, the BEST (TM) Assay is a versatile and specialized biofilm reactor capable of culturing bacterial and fungal biofilms in a replicated, high throughput, multi-well format. The microorganism forms a biofilm on the surfaces of pegs extending into liquid media contained within the microtitre plate wells. Additionally, planktonic cells also grow within the media in each well which allows simultaneous growth of biofilms and planktonic cultures within the wells of each reactor. Comparisons and evaluations of microbial biofilms on different surface materials can also be performed. For example, the bacterial ring rot pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus was studied in the BEST (TM) Assay to determine the conditions that promote growth in the biofilm form, the sensitivities of biofilm and planktonic cells to biocides, and the effects of biocide concentrations, exposure times and substrate types on efficacy. Technologies such as the BEST (TM) Assay excel at efficacy testing of chemical and biological agents being screened or developed for control of plant diseases, including postharvest diseases. Plant pathology research, phenotype screening, evaluating and formulating biological control products and protocols often ignore the critical aspect of biofilm potential. As a result, biofilm biology remains uncharacterized or unconfirmed for many plant-pathogen interactions and for most biocontrol agents. Biofilm reactors, such as the BEST (TM) Assay, provide technology for characterizing and evaluating these important issues.",0
"The potential influence of autochthonous microorganisms on virus fate in soil is usually determined through extreme conditions of sterilization vs. nonsterilization; however, the relative importance of microbial cells and their exudates remains unclear. In this study, bacterial cells (cell) were harvested, and their exuded extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted from three strains of bacteria, namely, Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. This study aimed to evaluate virus removal in solutions in the presence of cell, EPS, and their combination (cell/EPS), as well as to investigate how their presence affects virus removal efficiencies by four red soils based on batch experiments. Results showed that virus removal percentage in solutions ranged from 11 to 23 in the presence of cells only and from 12 to 15 in the presence of EPS only. The removal percentage in the combined cell/EPS treatment can be estimated by summing the results achieved by the cell and EPS treatments, separately. Meanwhile, cell presence had a negligible effect on virus removal by red soils. EPS and combined cell/EPS significantly reduced virus removal by 20 to 69 % and 16 to 50 %, respectively, which indicated that EPS served a dominant function in reducing virus removal. This study clearly demonstrated that the prediction of virus removal by red soils must consider the effect of bacteria, especially those producing large quantities of EPS, which can be responsible for the underestimation of viral load in certain studies.",0
"In this study, we present porous ceramics combining the antibacterial effect of copper with an integrated copper removal adsorbent. After preparing and characterizing the antibacterial copper-doped microbeads and monoliths (CuBs and CuMs), their antibacterial efficiency is probed against different nonpathogenic and pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). An antibacterial efficiency of 100% is reached within is min to 3 h for all tested strains under static conditions. Dynamic tests with B. subtilis and E. coli showed high antibacterial efficiency up to 99.93% even at continuous flux. To avoid any adverse effects on the environment, continuous removal of released copper-ions is accomplished with porous, high surface area monolithic adsorbents (MAds). MAds are prepared similarly to the CuMs but without adding copper during the manufacturing process. MAds reduce the amount of copper released from the CuMs >= 99% during the first 15 min, >= 90% up to 2 h, and after 22 h of continuous filtration up to 56% of the released copper is removed.",0
"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cell cytosol. Gene products required for intracellular bacterial growth and bacterial spread to adjacent cells are regulated by a transcriptional activator known as PrfA. PrfA becomes activated following L. monocytogenes entry into host cells, however the signal that stimulates PrfA activation has not yet been defined. Here we provide evidence for L. monocytogenes secretion of a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, which enhances the escape of L. monocytogenes from host cell vacuoles and may facilitate PrfA activation. The pPplA pheromone is generated via the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. While the PplA lipoprotein is dispensable for pathogenesis, bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of nonprofessional phagocytic cells. Mutational activation of PrfA restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling. Experimental evidence suggests that the pPplA peptide may help signal to L. monocytogenes its presence within the confines of the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol.",0
"A new series of fluoroquinolone-based benzothiazolyl-4-thiazolidinone hybrids has been yielded via sulfated tungstate-promoted highly accelerated N-formylation at a piperazine residue of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin entities. The formylated fluoroquinolone moieties were then coupled with substituted 2-aminobenzothiazoles, which were generated from their respective para-substituted amines to form corresponding Schiff base intermediates. The Schiff bases were then treated with thioglycolic acid to equip a new class of 4-thiazolidinones to be analyzed for their antibacterial effects against two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial strains and were found highly potent with lowest Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), 1-2g/mL, that is, more potent than control drugs ciprofloxacin (3.12-6.25g/mL). Initial outcomes provided for these novel molecular systems will aid researchers to design and develop new antibacterial drugs. The structural assignments of the new products were done on the basis of FT-IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.",0
"SecA, a key component of bacterial Sec-dependent secretion pathway, is an attractive target for exploring novel antimicrobials. Rose bengal (RB), a polyhalogenated fluorescein derivative, was found from our previous study as a potent SecA inhibitor. Here we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of 23 RB analogues that were designed by systematical dissection of RB. Evaluation of these analogues allowed us to establish an initial SAR in SecA inhibition. E.coli and B.subtilis.",0
"The study was carried out to assess antibacterial bioassay of Withania Somnifera. The antimicrobial activities of the butanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of With ania Somnifera. were investigated. The bacterial strains used were E.coli, C.albican, B. atropeous, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus Aureus and Salmonella, that highest zone of inhibition 14 mm resulted for the ethyl acetate extract of With ania Somnifera against I! aeruginosa and Chlorform extract against E. coli. Other significant results obtained by different crude extracts are 13 mm, 12mm and 11 mm against E. coli, C. albican, B. atropeous, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus Aureus and Salmonella. Aqueous, n-hexane and chloroform extract were found totally inactive against Salamonella",0
"During the infectious process, bacterial pathogens are subject to changes in environmental conditions such as nutrient availability, immune response challenges, bacterial density and physical contacts with targeted host cells. These conditions occur in the colonized organs, in diverse regions within infected tissues or even at the subcellular level for intracellular pathogens. Integration of enviromnental cues leads to measurable biological responses in the bacterium required for adaptation. Recent progress in technology enabled the study of bacterial adaptation in situ using genetically encoded reporters that allow single cell analysis or whole body imaging based on fluorescent proteins, alternative fluorescent assays or luciferases. This review presents a historical perspective and technical details on the methods used to develop transcriptional reporters, protein-protein interaction assays and secretion detection assays to study pathogenic bacteria adaptation in situ. Finally, studies published in the last 5 years on gram positive and gram negative bacterial adaptation to the host during infection are discussed. However, the methods described here could easily be extended to study complex microbial communities within host tissue and in the environment. (C) 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a common commensal bacterium colonizing the skin and mucosal surfaces of household animals. However, it has recently emerged as a dangerous opportunistic pathogen, comparable to S. aureus for humans. The epidemiological situation is further complicated by the increasing number of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius infections and evidence of gene transmission driving antibiotic resistance between staphylococci colonizing human and zoonotic hosts. In the present study, we describe a unique peptide, BacSp222, that possesses features characteristic of both bacteriocins and virulence factors. BacSp222 is secreted in high quantities by S. pseudintermedius strain 222 isolated from dog skin lesions. This linear, fifty-amino-acid highly cationic peptide is plasmid-encoded and does not exhibit significant sequence similarities to any other known peptides or proteins. BacSp222 kills gram-positive bacteria (at doses ranging from 0.1 to several micromol/l) but also demonstrates significant cytotoxic activities towards eukaryotic cells at slightly higher concentrations. Moreover, at nanomolar concentrations, the peptide also possesses modulatory properties, efficiently enhancing interferon gamma-induced nitric oxide release in murine macrophage-like cell lines. BacSp222 appears to be one of the first examples of multifunctional peptides that breaks the convention of splitting bacteriocins and virulence factors into two unrelated groups.",0
"Colloids (non-biological and biological) with different sizes are ubiquitous in natural environment. The investigations regarding the influence of different-sized colloids on the transport and deposition behaviors of engineered-nanoparticles in porous media yet are still largely lacking. This study investigated the effects of different-sized non-biological and biological colloids on the transport of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO(2)) in quartz sand under both electrostatically favorable and unfavorable conditions. Fluorescent carboxylate-modified polystyrene latex microspheres (CML) with sizes of 0.2-2 mu m were utilized as model non-biological colloids, while Gram-negative Escherichia coli (similar to 1 mu m) and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis (similar to 2 mu m) were employed as model biological colloids. Under the examined solution conditions, both breakthrough curves and retained profiles of nTiO(2) with different-sized CML particles/bacteria were similar as those without colloids under favorable conditions, indicating that the copresence of model colloids in suspensions had negligible effects on the transport and deposition of nTiO(2) under favorable conditions. In contrast, higher breakthrough curves and lower retained profiles of nTiO(2) with CML particles/bacteria relative to those without copresent colloids were observed under unfavorable conditions. Clearly, the copresence of model colloids increased the transport and decreased the deposition of nTiO(2) in quartz sand under unfavorable conditions (solution conditions examined in present study). Both competition of deposition sites on quartz sand surfaces and the enhanced stability/dispersion of nTiO(2) induced by copresent colloids were found to be responsible for the increased nTiO(2) transport with colloids under unfavorable conditions. Moreover, the smallest colloids had the highest coverage on sand surface and most significant dispersion effect on nTiO(2), resulting in the greatest nTiO(2) transport.

"In this work, synthesis of some new five coordinated zinc halide/pseudo-halide complexes of a N-3-tridentate ligand is presented. All complexes were subjected to spectroscopic and physical methods such as FT-IR, UV-visible, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra, thermal analyses and conductivity measurements for identification. Based on spectral data, the general formula of ZnLX2 (X = Cl-, Br-, I-, SCN- and N-3(-)) was proposed for the zinc complexes. Zinc complexes have been also prepared in nano-structure sizes under ultrasonic irradiation. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied for confirmation of nano-structure character for the complexes. Among the complexes, zinc azide complex structure was analyzed by X-ray crystallography. This complex crystallizes as a triplet in trigonal system with space group of P3(1). The coordination sphere around the zinc center is well shown as a distorted trigonal bipyramidal with three nitrogen atoms from Schiff base ligand and two terminal azide nitrogen atoms attached to zinc ion. Various intermolecular interactions such as N-H center dot center dot center dot N, C-H center dot center dot center dot N and C-H center dot center dot center dot pi hydrogen bonding interactions stabilize crystalline lattice so that they causes a three dimensional supramolecular structure for the complex. In vitro screening of the compounds for their antimicrobial activities showed that ZnLI2, ZnL(N-3)(2), ZnLCl2 and ZnL(NCS)(2) were found as the most effective compound against bacteria of Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli respectively. Also ZnLI2 and ZnLCl2 complexes were found more effective against two selected fungi than others. Finally, thermal behaviors of the zinc complexes showed that they are decomposed via 2-4 thermal steps from room temperature up to 1000 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Objective: A study was conducted to explore the effect of Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecium enteric-coated capsules for AIDS-associated diarrhoea. Methods: A total of 80 AIDS patients who were treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at a hospital in Chongqing, China, from July 2013 to May 2014 were randomly divided into a control group and observation group, with 40 patients in each group. The control group was treated with HAART, while the observation group was treated with HAART combined with B. subtilis and E. faecium enteric-coated capsules; the course of treatment was 24 weeks for the two groups. After treatment, the effect of HAART and the incidence of AIDS-associated diarrhoea and the status of stool culture infection with fungi in the two groups were observed. Results: The effective rate of HAART in the observation group and control group was 75% and 70%, respectively; the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The incidences of AIDS-associated diarrhoea and stool culture infection with fungi in the control group were significantly higher than in the observation group; the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). Conclusion: B. subtilis and E. faecium enteric-coated capsules can effectively prevent AIDS-associated diarrhoea and reduce secondary intestinal fungal infection.",1
"AimsThe environmental pathogen Streptococcus uberis causes intramammary infections in dairy cows. Because biofilm growth might contribute to Strep.uberis mastitis, we conducted a biological screen to identify genes potentially involved in the regulation of biofilm growth. Methods and ResultsBy screening a transposon mutant library of Strep.uberis, we determined that the disruption of 13 genes (including hasA, coaC, clpP, miaA, nox and uidA) led to increased biofilm formation. One of the genes (SUB1382) encoded a homologue of the LiaR response regulator (RR) of the Bacillus subtilis two-component signalling system (TCS). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that DNA binding by LiaR was greatly enhanced by phosphorylation. Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis analyses of the liaR mutant and the parental Strep.uberis strain revealed five differentially produced proteins with at least a 15-fold change in relative abundance (P<005). ConclusionsThe DNA-binding protein LiaR is a potential regulator of biofilm formation by Strep.uberis. Significance and Impact of the StudySeveral molecular primary and downstream targets involved in biofilm formation by Strep.uberis were identified. This provides a solid foundation for further studies on the regulation of biofilm formation in this important pathogen.",0
"The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that Bacillus subtilis antagonises enterotoxic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infection through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways. In vitro studies were performed in which ETEC-infected Caco-2 cultured human intestinal cells were first incubated with B. subtilis and then ETEC adhesion and MAPK activation were determined. Incubation with B. subtilis was found to reduce ETEC adhesion in Caco-2 cells by 58-72 % in the adhesive experiments (competition, exclusion, and displacement assays). ETEC was able to induce extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and p38 MAPK activation, but not c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, in Caco-2 cells. ETEC-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, but not of p38, was inhibited significantly in ETEC-infected Caco-2 cells treated with B. subtilis. These findings suggest that B. subtilis is able to inhibit ETEC infection through blocking ETEC-induced ERK1/2 activation in Caco-2 cells. The data could provide a rationale for the clinical application of B. subtilis in enteric pathogenic infection.",0
"Thin-spined porcupines (Chaetomys subspinosus) are threatened with extinction and are categorized as vulnerable. This is because of alteration to and loss of their habitat and possible hunting activities in their distribution area. Their spines constitute one of their defense mechanisms, which can be fomites for pathogens to humans. However, little is known about such pathogens. The present study aimed to detect bacteria on spines of C. subspinosus, from the Una Biological Reserve, South of Bahia, northeastern Brazil, by analyzing metagenomic DNA, isolating bacterial culture, using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique, and sequencing. Six anatomical points were selected for withdrawing spine samples from an individual C. subspinosus. At all sample points, bacteria were detected by bacteriological culture and/or DGGE and sequencing of excised bands. When all samples were combined, standard PCR-DGGE analysis of bacteria present in the spines identified 15 distinct bands, thereby revealing a distinct bacterial community. The main pathogens identified through sequencing were Bacillus cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. anthracis, and B. pumilus. The present study demonstrated the isolation and identification of non-pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria on the spines of C. subspinosus.",0
"Aim: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox r super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. Material and methods: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox r [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. Results: Medilox r was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in = 1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in = 2 minutes and on certain molds in = 5 minutes. Conclusion: Medilox r super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.",0
"A series of novel aromatic sulfonamide derivatives (1-7) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, and LC/MS techniques. The compounds' quantum mechanical descriptors, surface area, and molecular volume were calculated. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro as antimicrobial agents against representative strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and as antifungal agents for yeast by both the disc diffusion and minimal inhibition concentration methods for comparison. All the bacteria and fungi studied were screened against some commercial antibiotics to compare with our chemicals' zone diameters. Quantitative structure-activity relationship studies with multiple linear regression analysis were applied to find the correlation between the different calculated molecular descriptors of the synthesized compounds and biological activity.",0
"Bacteria capable of utilizing Pentachlorophenol as sole C source in minimal medium were analysed for their capability to biotransform PCP to intermediate metabolites. Selected isolates were also assessed, alone and in combination, for their ability to biotransform PCP in sterile soil. HPLC studies revealed decrease in the residual PCP and formation of intermediates such as tetrachlorohydroquinone (TeCH) and dichlorophenols (DCP) by the isolates. Removal of PCP from sterile soil by selected isolates, viz. Ensifer adhaerens (LK 4), Pseudomonas putida (LK 39) and Lysinibacillus fusiformis (LK156), was studied in a 30 d experiment under controlled condition. These isolates were used alone and in combination. PCP removal by mixed inoculum was significantly higher (68.81%) than single inoculation after 30 d of incubation. The results of this study indicate that the enriched mixed inoculum has better potential in scavenging PCP from soil as compared to individual isolates. The potential isolates obtained in the present study can be used for developing consortium for bioremediation of sites contaminated with PCP.",0
"Aim: To investigate the transovarial transmission of Bacillus subtilis in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Materials and methods: A bacterium was isolated from the eggs of the silkworm, B. mori. A gene encoding 16S rRNA was amplified using PCR, sequenced and the bacterium was identified. To investigate the pathogenicity and transmission in the progeny of silkworm, bacterial suspensions of 1.0*10 6 CFU and 4.0*10 6 CFU was inoculated to the silkworm larvae individually. Bacterial infection in the tissues and larval mortality was recorded. Transovarial transmission in the progeny eggs of silkworms was evaluated using sequence homology of inoculated bacterium, isolated from the haemolymph of infected parent and from progeny eggs. Results: A bacterium isolated from the eggs of silkworms was identified as B. subtilis. The pathogenic effect was observed in the form of 64-77% mortality during larval and pupal stages. The prevalence of pathogenic bacterium in the progeny eggs, laid by infected females confirmed that the bacteria inoculated to the parent was transmitted into progeny eggs. The results indicated that isolated bacterium as B. subtilis is pathogenic to B. mori causing 64-77% mortality during larval and pupa stages. The adults those survived infections, laid infected eggs evidence the sequence homology of B. subtilis isolated from infected parents and their progeny eggs. Thus this is the first report on transovarial transmission of a Bacillus sp. in insects. Conclusion: Prevalence of pathogenic bacterium, B. subtilis isolated from eggs indicated transovarial transmission in the silkworm, B. mori. The transovarial transmission of B. subtilis was confirmed in the silkworm, B. mori on the basis of bioassay and 16S rRNA homology analysis.",1

"Three new compounds were isolated from the adult insect of Allomyrina dichotoma L. for the first time. A new skeleton compound is named as Allomyrinanoid A (1) originated from the familiar norbornane derivatives and two new compounds of purine alkaloid are named as adenine-9-methylaldehyde oxime B (2) and 6-N-methyleneimine-adenine-9-methylaldehyde oxime B (3). The compounds (2) and (3) are the tautomers of imine-enamine and creatively separated form the solvent using column chromatography method. The structures of all isolated compounds were established by spectroscopic methods including analyses of their 1D, 2D NMR and HRESI-MS data, and confirmed by comparison of the literature data. These new components displayed antibacterial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strain. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
"Two endophytic bacterial strains, Fy11 and Zy44 (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), isolated from Ginkgo biloba leaves, were tested as a single application and in combination for their abilities to suppress pepper phytophthora blight under greenhouse conditions. When both strains were applied in a mixture, the disease severity was more reduced. The objective of this study was to find out the inhibitory mechanisms of synergistic activity against pepper phytophthora blight through a mixture of Fy11 + Zy44. Firstly, the colonization ability of the two endophytic bacterial strains was tested in pepper tissues. The result indicated that both endophytic strains were efficient colonizers of pepper, and could vertically transfer from roots to shoots and leaves. After inoculation for 7 days, the population densities of Fy11-gfp and Zy44-gfp were 24.7 x 10(3) CFU/g FW and 13.0 +/- 10(3) CFU/g FW in pepper roots, respectively. The cell counts of co-inoculated Fy11 + Zy44 were not significant different comparing to a single strain inter pepper tissues. Secondly, the direct antagonism of antifungal compounds produced by the endophytic bacteria were investigated against pepper phytophthora blight. The crude lipopeptides produced by strain Zy44 highly effectively reduced disease index, and the control efficacy reached 84.8% and 67.2% in 7 d and 15 d after inoculation with the pathogen, respectively. The control effect of the secondary metabolites produced by strain Fy11 was not obvious. In the end, the induced systemic resistance (ISR) mediated by strains Fy11 and Zy44 on pepper were further analysed using priming effect of the defense-related genes after pathogen challenge. The expressions of CaPR4 (Capsicum annuum pathogenesis-protein 4) and CaBGLU (C. annuum beta-1,3-glucanase) were strongly induced in the plants treated with strain Fy11 in 24 h after pathogen challenge, but CaPR4 and CaBGLU transcripts were not increased in the plants treated with strain Zy44. These results indicated that the mechanisms of additive effect through combined strains Zy44 and Fy11 might be due to direct antagonism of antifungal lipopeptides produced by strain Zy44, as well as indirect inhibition through ISR induced by strain Fy11. Therefore, the synergistic interactions were due to the summation of biocontrol mechanisms of both biocontrol agents. This work provides a theoretical explanation for our findings of reduced disease severity with a mixture of endophytic bacteria. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.",0
"The present research was aimed at assessing the quality of air and soil on the premises and in the vicinity of the municipal landfill sites in Torun with regard to the presence of pathogenic bacteria, potentially dangerous to humans. Air samples (the impaction method using a MAS-100 impactor) and soil samples were collected from seven sampling sites including the operating and closed landfill cells, sampling sites located near leachate ponds, and sampling sites located outside the above premises. The research also involved assessing microbial air contamination in three indoor spaces on the premises of the landfill sites. Microbial tests involved the determination of the number of culturable mesophilic, mannitolpositive, and alpha- and beta-hemolytic bacteria in the air, determination of the number of coliform bacteria, spore-forming Clostridium perfringens in soil, and the presence of Salmonella in soil. The results indicate that bioaerosol emitted by this municipal facility is the source of hemolytic bacteria (<= 300 CFU m(-3) of air), as well as of pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis). The highest risk of exposure to biological agents was determined in the sorting facility. Over sixty percent of air samples in this sampling site presented high pollution degree with mesophilic bacteria (500-2000 CFU m(-3) of air) and over one fourth of air samples presented very high pollution degree (>2000 CFU m(-3) of air). Indoor air in other rooms was considered highly/moderately contaminated (100-2000 CFU m(-3) of air). The highest risk related to the presence of Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, and coliform bacteria in soil was determined at the operating landfill cell and near the leachate pond of the closed landfill cell. At the operating landfill cell the total coli ranged from 4-1226 MPN g(-1) of dry mass of soil and Clostridium perfringens ranged from <LOD-1604 CFU g(-1) of dry mass of soil. The results question the strategy of municipal landfill sites in densely populated areas, and emphasize the need for regular monitoring of microbiological tests in their vicinity as well as for control strategies in order to protect workers at landfill sites. The results of the study should be used for future decisions on the location of municipal landfill sites and suggest the need for better environmental control technologies in the sites that are already functioning.",0
"All viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and depend on certain host cell functions for multiplication. However, the extent of such dependence and the exact nature of the functions provided by the host cell remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated if nonessential Bacillus subtilis genes are necessary for multiplication of bacteriophage SPP1. Screening of a collection of 2,514 single-gene knockouts of nonessential B. subtilis genes yielded only a few genes necessary for efficient SPP1 propagation. Among these were genes belonging to the yuk operon, which codes for the Esat-6-like secretion system, including the SPP1 receptor protein YueB. In addition, we found that SPP1 multiplication was negatively affected by the absence of two other genes, putB and efp. The gene efp encodes elongation factor P, which enhances ribosome activity by alleviating translational stalling during the synthesis of polyproline-containing proteins. PutB is an enzyme involved in the proline degradation pathway that is required for infection in the post-exponential growth phase of B. subtilis, when the bacterium undergoes a complex genetic reprogramming. The putB knockout shortens significantly the window of opportunity for SPP1 infection during the host cell life cycle. This window is a critical parameter for competitive phage multiplication in the soil environment, where B. subtilis rarely meets conditions for exponential growth. Our results in combination with those reported for other virus-host systems suggest that bacterial viruses have evolved toward limited dependence on nonessential host functions. IMPORTANCE A successful viral infection largely depends on the ability of the virus to hijack cellular machineries and to redirect the flow of building blocks and energy resources toward viral progeny production. However, the specific virus-host interactions underlying this fundamental transformation are poorly understood. Here, we report on the first systematic analysis of virus-host cross talk during bacteriophage infection in Gram-positive bacteria. We show that lytic bacteriophage SPP1 is remarkably independent of nonessential genes of its host, Bacillus subtilis, with only a few cellular genes being necessary for efficient phage propagation. We hypothesize that such limited dependence of the virus on its host results from a constant ""evolutionary arms race"" and might be much more widespread than currently thought.",0
"The Lon AAA+ protease is a highly conserved intracellular protease that is considered an anticancer target in eukaryotic cells and a crucial virulence regulator in bacteria. Lon degrades both damaged, misfolded proteins and specific native regulators, but how Lon discriminates among a large pool of candidate targets remains unclear. Here we report that Bacillus subtilis LonA specifically degrades the master regulator of flagellar biosynthesis SwrA governed by the adaptor protein swarming motility inhibitor A (SmiA). SmiA-dependent LonA proteolysis is abrogated upon microbe-substrate contact causing SwrA protein levels to increase and elevate flagellar density above a critical threshold for swarming motility atop solid surfaces. Surface contact-dependent cellular differentiation in bacteria is rapid, and regulated proteolysis may be a general mechanism of transducing surface stimuli.",0
"BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 107-8 colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.",0
"The prion agent is notoriously resistant to common proteases and conventional sterilisation procedures. The current methods known to destroy prion infectivity such as incineration, alkaline and thermal hydrolysis are harsh, destructive, environmentally polluting and potentially hazardous, thus limit their applications for decontamination of delicate medical and laboratory devices, remediation of prion contaminated environment and for processing animal by-products including specified risk materials and carcases. Therefore, an environmentally friendly, non-destructive enzymatic degradation approach is highly desirable. A feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis N22 keratinase has been isolated which degraded scrapie prion to undetectable level of PrPSc signals as determined by Western Blot analysis. Prion infectivity was verified by ex vivo cell-based assay. An enzymatic formulation combining N22 keratinase and biosurfactant derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa degraded PrPSc at 65 degrees C in 10 min to undetectable level -. A time-course degradation analysis carried out at 50 degrees C over 2 h revealed the progressive attenuation of PrPSc intensity. Test of residual infectivity by standard cell culture assay confirmed that the enzymatic formulation reduced PrPSc infectivity to undetectable levels as compared to cells challenged with untreated standard scrapie sheep prion (SSBP/1) (p-value = 0.008 at 95% confidence interval). This novel enzymatic formulation has significant potential application for prion decontamination in various environmentally friendly systems under mild treatment conditions.",0
"Ten beta-lactam derivatives (6a-j) with an O-phenyl group at C-2, a glycoside at C-3 and various substituted phenyl rings on the nitrogen, were formed via a series of reactions starting with the glycoside precursors, functionalizing this to the aldehyde, forming the imines and finally the lactams, which were modified, removing the benzyl group on the glycoside producing a further set of lactams (7a-j) and converting them to the beta(2,3) amino acids (8a-j) in the final stage of the synthesis. The synthesis and structural elucidation of the three sets of compounds are discussed here. In addition, the crystal structure of 6e is also discussed, which shows the absolute configuration of the molecule to be 2S,3R. The Hirshfeld interactions are calculated to be Cl center dot center dot center dot H (11.1 %), O center dot center dot center dot H (8.0 %) and N center dot center dot center dot H (0.4 %). The reaction mechanism for the formation of the beta-lactam is also proposed. The three sets of compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against three gram-positive (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and one gram-negative strain (Escherichia coli). The beta(2,3)-amino acids 8a, 8b and 8h showed good antibacterial activity against all strains with MIC values between 0.17 and 1.44 mM, comparable to the standard ampicillin. All three compounds showed better activity to E. coli than ampicillin. Interestingly, molecular docking to the penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2X) showed the same three compounds 8a, 8b and 8h to have a better MolDock score than ampicillin and the free carboxyl groups in the beta-amino acid to bind to Ser337, blocking it from further binding with peptidoglycan for cross-linking and subsequent transpeptidation.",0
"Objective: To determine the antibacterial and anti-candidal activities of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) extracted from marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata and evaluate the inhibition activity of DNA isolated from test pathogenic microorganism.MethodS: FAME was synthesized by transesterification of oil using immobilized lipase and characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. The FAME profile was determined using gas chromatography. The antimicrobial effect was tested by disc diffusion method against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and yeast Candida albicans, at varying concentrations of 10, 20 and 30 mu L/disc.Results: The results shown that palmitic acid (C16:0), oleic acid (C18:1) and arachidic acid (C20:0) were dominant in Nannochloropsis oculata oil. The study revealed that FAME was more active against Gram-negative than against Gram-positive and yeast. DNA inhibition activity results also confirmed that FAME had the bactericidal effect that was revealed by sheared fragments of DNA.Conclusions: The results indicated that microalgal FAME could be potentially utilized as a newer and good source of therapeutic agent in pharmaceutical industry.",0
"Background: Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a frequently occurring disease in northeastern Thailand, where soil and water high in salt content are common. Using microarray analysis, we previously showed that B. pseudomallei up-regulated a short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase (SDO) under salt stress. However, the importance of SDO in B. pseudomallei infection is unknown. This study aimed to explore the function of B. pseudomallei SDO, and to investigate its role in interactions between B. pseudomallei and host cells. Results: Bioinformatics analysis of B. pseudomallei SDO structure, based on homology modeling, revealed a NAD(+) cofactor domain and a catalytic triad containing Ser149, Tyr162, and Lys166. This is similar to Bacillus megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase. To investigate the role of this protein, we constructed a B. pseudomallei SDO defective mutant, measured glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) activity, and tested the interactions with host cells. The B. pseudomallei K96243 wild type exhibited potent GDH activity under condition containing 300 mM NaCl, while the mutant showed activity levels 15 times lower. Both invasion into the A549 cell line and early intracellular survival within the J774A.1 macrophage cell were impaired in the mutant. Complementation of SDO was able to restore the mutant ability to produce GDH activity, invade epithelial cells, and survive in macrophages. Conclusions: Our data suggest that induced SDO activity during salt stress may facilitate B. pseudomallei invasion and affect initiation of successful intracellular infection. Identifying the role of B. pseudomallei SDO provides a better understanding of the association between bacterial adaptation and pathogenesis in melioidosis.",0
"A multitude of sooty blotch and flyspeck fungi, mainly belonging to the Ascomycetes order Capnodiales, causes dark blemishes and flyspeck-like spots on apples worldwide. Different sooty blotch and flyspeck fungi can coexist in the same orchard and even on a single fruit. Our preceding experiments revealed an activity of Microcyclospora malicola strain 1930 against the anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum fioriniae in dual culture assays. Extracts of M. malicola strain 1930 showed a broad bioactivity against filamentous fungus Mucor hiemalis and gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. A bioactivity-guided isolation led to the identification of obionin A (1) as the main active principle. In addition to 1, which was previously isolated from the marine fungus Leptosphaeria obiones, we isolated three derivatives. Metabolite 2 bears a keto function at C-6, besides the replacement of oxygen by nitrogen at position 10. Two more derivatives are adducts (3, 4) of acetone as work-up artifacts. Because obionin A (1) and its derivative 2 showed cytotoxic effects and antifungal activities, we propose a role of these secondary metabolites in the antagonism between M. malicola and other apple colonizing sooty blotch and flyspeck fungi, other epiphytes, or apple pathogens competing for the same ecological niche.",0
"Clostridium perfringens is a Gram-positive rod that is widely distributed in nature and is the etiological agent of several human and animal diseases. The complete genome sequence of C perfringens strain 13 has been determined and multiple two-component signal transduction systems identified. One of these systems, designated here as the MalNO system, was analyzed in this study. Microarray analysis was used to carry out functional analysis of a malO mutant. The results, which were confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR, indicated that genes putatively involved in the uptake and metabolism of maltose were up-regulated in the malO mutant. These effects were reversed by complementation with the wild-type malO gene. Growth of these isogenic strains in medium with and without maltose showed that the malO mutant recovered more quickly from maltose deprivation when compared to the wild-type and complemented strains, leading to the conclusion that the MalNO system regulates maltose utilization in C perfringens. It is postulated that this regulatory network may allow this soil bacterium and opportunistic pathogen to respond to environmental conditions where there are higher concentrations of maltose or maltodextrins, such as in the presence of decaying plant material in rich soil.

"Commercially available beta-ionone was used as a starting material for a four-step chemical synthesis of three new gamma-halolactones. During these processes one known (beta-ionol) and some new compounds (gamma,delta-unsaturated ester, gamma,delta-unsaturated acid, chloro-, bromo- and iodo-lactone) were obtained. In the last step, halolactones were converted into a hydroxylactone by several fungal strains (Fusarium species, Syncephalastrum racemosum, Botrytis cinerea). Most of the selected microorganisms transformed these lactones by the hydrolytic dehalogenation. The synthetic halolactones and the hydroxylactone obtained during biotransformation inhibited growth of some bacteria, yeasts and fungi and showed deterrent activity against aphids Myzus persicae.

"Platelets are anucleate cells derived from the megakaryocyte series, and have long been considered only as cells responsible for coagulation and the fibrinolysis process. However, recently more data shows that they are also effector cells in the inflammatory response and important elements of the immunological response. Platelets store and release many biologically active substances, including growth factors, cytokines and chemokines (tab. 1), which actively affect i.a. elements of the immune system, and thus become regulators of immunity and mediators of inflammatory response. Their impact on the immune system cells is also associated with the induction of leucocytes and progenitor cells to the site of pathogen permeation or vascular injury inflow, as well as endothelial cells. Interacting with neutrophlls, monocytes and lymphocytes, they not only activate them, but also form platelet-leukocyte aggregates that immobilise pathogens and prevent their spreading. Furthermore, platelets are capable of absorbing pathogens, affecting anti-infection immunity of the system. It is also assumed that the presence of receptors on their surface, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), affects their initiation and activity of the immunological response.",0
"In the present study, the antibacterial and antifungal investigations were carried out with the crude extracts obtained from the leaves of Murraya koenigii using different solvents like petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol and water. The effect of different extracts were tested on gram positive bacteria like Bacillus subtilis and Gram negative bacteria, Salmonella typhi, E. coli and the fungus, Shigella sonnei and Candida utilis by in vitro agar well diffusion method. This study scientifically supports the usage of leaves of Muraya koenigii as a remedy for various superficial bacterial and fungal infections.",0
"Heat-resistant spores of Clostridium botulinum can withstand the pasteurization processes in modern food processing. This poses a risk to food safety as spores may germinate into botulinum neurotoxin-producing vegetative cells. Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, the model organism for sporulation, is regulated by the transcription factor Spo0A and four alternative sigma factors, SigF, SigE, SigG, and SigK. While the corresponding regulators are found in available genomes of C botulinum, little is known about their expression. To accurately measure the expression of these genes using quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) during the exponential and stationary growth phases, a suitable normalization reference gene is required. 16S rrn, adK, alaS, era, gluD, gyrA, rpoC, and rpsJ were selected as the candidate reference genes. The most stable candidate reference gene was 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rrn), based on its low coefficient of variation (1.81%) measured during the 18-h study time. Using 16S rrn as the normalization reference gene, the relative expression levels of spo0A, sigF, sigE, sigG, and sigK were measured over 18 h. The pattern of expression showed spo0A expression during the logarithmic growth phase, followed by a drop in expression upon entry to the stationary phase. Expression levels of sigF, sigE, and sigG peaked simultaneously at the end of the exponential growth phase. Peak expression of sigK occurred at 18 h, however low levels of expression were detected during the exponential phase. These findings suggest these sigma factors play a role in C botulinum sporulation that is similar, but not equal, to their role in the B. subtilis model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"The ubiquitous pathogen Listeria monocytogenes lives either saprophytically in the environment or within cells in a vertebrate host, thus adapting its lifestyle to its ecological niche. Growth experiments at 24 and 37 degrees C (environmental and host temperature) with ammonium or glutamine as nitrogen sources revealed that ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source of L.monocytogenes. Reduced growth on glutamine is more obvious at 24 degrees C. Global transcriptional microarray analyses showed that the most striking difference in temperature-dependent transcription was observed for central nitrogen metabolism genes, glnR (glutamine synthetase repressor GlnR), glnA (glutamine synthetase GlnA), amtB (ammonium transporter AmtB), glnK (PII regulatory protein GlnK), and gdh (glutamate dehydrogenase) when cells were grown on glutamine. When grown on ammonium, both at 24 and 37 degrees C, the transcriptional level of these genes resembles that of cells grown with glutamine at 37 degrees C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies and qPCR analyses in the wild-type L.monocytogenes and the deletion mutant L.monocytogenes glnR revealed that the transcriptional regulator GlnR is directly involved in temperature- and nitrogen source-dependent regulation of the respective genes. Glutamine, a metabolite known to influence GlnR activity, seems unlikely to be the (sole) intracellular signal mediating this temperature-and nitrogen source-dependent metabolic adaptation.",0
"Five new xanthones, garciniacowones A-E (1-5), together with 14 known xanthones, 6-19, were isolated from the young fruits and fresh flowers of Garcinia cowa. The structures of 1-5 were elucidated by analysis of their 1D and 2D NMR spectra and mass spectrometric data. The compounds 1-19 were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity and for their ability to inhibit alpha-glucosidase. Compounds 16 and 17 showed the most potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, with IC50 values of 7.8 +/- 0.5 and 8.7 +/- 0.3 mu M, respectively. Compounds 8, 9, and 19 showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis TISTR 088 with identical MIC values of 2 mu g/mL, while 8, 10, and 19 exhibited antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688 with identical MIC values of 4 mu g/mL.",0
"Insect-derived Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors exhibit thrombin, elastase, plasmin, proteinase K, or subtilisin A inhibition activity, but so far, no functional roles for bee-derived Kazal-type serine protease inhibitors have been identified. In this study, a bee (Apis cerana) venom Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor (AcKTSPI) that acts as a microbial serine protease inhibitor was identified. AcKTSPI contained a single Kazal domain that displayed six conserved cysteine residues and a P1 threonine residue. AcKTSPI was expressed in the venom gland and was present as a 10-kDa peptide in bee venom. Recombinant AcKTSPI Kazal domain (AcKTSPI-Kd) expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells demonstrated inhibitory activity against subtilisin A (K-i 67.03 nM) and proteinase K (K-i 91.53 nM), but not against alpha-chymotiypsin or trypsin, which implies a role for AcKTSPI as a microbial serine protease inhibitor. However, AcKTSPI-Kd exhibited no detectable inhibitory effects on factor Xa, thrombin, tissue plasminogen activator, or elastase. Additionally, AcKTSPI-Kd bound directly to Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Beauveria bassiana, and Fusarium graminearum but not to Escherichia coli. Consistent with these findings, AcKTSPI-Kd showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and antifungal activity against both plant-pathogenic and entomopathogenic fungi. These findings constitute molecular evidence that AcKTSPI acts as an inhibitor of microbial serine proteases. This paper provides a novel view of the antimicrobial functions of a bee venom Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"This study explores the role of membrane phospholipid peroxidation in the copper alloy mediated contact killing of Bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterial species. We found that B.subtilis endospores exhibited significant resistance to copper alloy surface killing but vegetative cells were highly sensitive to copper surface exposure. Cell death and lipid peroxidation occurred in B.subtilis upon copper alloy surface exposure. In a sporulation-defective strain carrying a deletion of almost the entire SpoIIA operon, lipid peroxidation directly correlated with cell death. Moreover, killing and lipid peroxidation initiated immediately and at a constant rate upon exposure to the copper surface without the delay observed previously in E.coli. These findings support the hypothesis that membrane lipid peroxidation is the initiating event causing copper surface induced cell death of B.subtilis vegetative cells. The findings suggest that the observed differences in the kinetics of copper-induced killing compared to E.coli result from differences in cell envelop structure. As demonstrated in E.coli, DNA degradation was shown to be a secondary effect of copper exposure in a B.subtilis sporulation-defective strain.",0
"Staphylococcus aureus is one of the prominent Gram positive human pathogen secretes many surface and secretary proteins including various enzymes and pathogenic factors that favour the successful colonization and infection of host tissue. alpha-amylase is one of the enzymes secreted by S. aureus which catalyses the breakdown of complex sugars to monosaccharides, which are required for colonization and survival of this pathogen in any anatomical locales. In the present study we have cloned, sequenced, expressed and characterized alpha-amylase gene from S. aureus ATCC12600. The recombinant enzyme has a molecular weight of 58kDa and the kinetics showed Vmax 0.0208±0.033 (mg/ml)/mg/min and Km 10.633±0.737mg/ml. The multiple sequence analysis showed alpha- amylase of S. aureus exhibited large differences with Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus bovis. As the crystal structure of S. aureus alpha- amylase was unavailable, we used homology modelling method to build the structure. The built structure was validated by Ramachandran plot which showed 90% of the residues in the allowed region while no residue was found in the disallowed region and the built structure was close to the crystal structure with Z-Score: -6.85. The structural superimposition studies with alpha- amylases of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus bovis showed distinct differences with RMSD values of 18.158Aand 7.091A respectively which correlated with enzyme kinetics, indicating alpha-amylase is different among these bacteria.",0
"Bacillus cereus is increasingly recognized as one of the major causes of food poisoning in the industrialized world. In this paper, we describe a sensitive double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that was developed for rapid detection of B. cereus in food to minimize the risk of contamination. The polyclonal antibody (pAb) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to B. cereus were generated from rabbit antiserum and mouse ascites, respectively, using the octanoic acid/saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation method and protein A-sepharose columns. IgG-isotype mAbs were specially developed to undergo a novel peripheral multiple sites immunization for rapid gain of hybridomas and a subtractive screen was used to eliminate cross reactivity with closely related species such as Bacillus thuringiensis, B. subtilis, B. licheniformis and B. perfringens. The linear detection range of the method was approximately 1 x 10(4)-2.8 x 10(6) cells/mL with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.9 x 10(3) cells/mL. The assay was able to detect B. cereus when the samples were prepared in meat with various pathogens. The newly developed analytical method provides a rapid method to sensitively detect B. cereus in food specimens.",0
"Background: The brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) is one of the most destructive rice plant pests in Asia. N. lugens causes extensive damage to rice by sucking rice phloem sap, which results in hopper burn (complete death of the rice plants). Despite its importance, little is known about the digestion, development and defense mechanisms of this hemimetabolous insect pest. In this study, we aim to identify the serine protease (SP) and serine protease homolog (SPH) genes, which form a large family in eukaryotes, due to the potential for multiple physiological roles. Having a fully sequenced genome for N. lugens allows us to perform in-depth analysis of the gene structures, reveal the evolutionary relationships and predict the physiological functions of SP genes. Results: The genome-and transcriptome-wide analysis identified 90 putative SP (65) and SPH (25) genes in N. lugens. Detailed gene information regarding the exon-intron organization, size, distribution and transcription orientation in the genome revealed that many SP/SPH loci are closely situated on the same scaffold, indicating the frequent occurrence of gene duplications in this large gene family. The gene expression profiles revealed new findings with regard to how SPs/SPHs respond to bacterial infections as well as their tissue-, development-and sex-specific expressions. Conclusions: Our findings provide comprehensive gene sequence resources and expression profiles of the N. lugens SP and SPH genes, which give insights into clarifying the potentially functional roles of these genes in the biological processes including development, digestion, reproduction and immunity.",0
"Edible mushrooms (EMs) are nutritionally rich source of proteins and essential amino acids. In the present study, the antioxidant activity via 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and antimicrobial potential in EMs (Pleurotus ostreatus, Morchella esculenta, P. ostreatus (Black), P. ostreatus (Yellow) and Pleurotus sajor-caju) were investigated. The DPPH radical scavenging activity revealed that the significantly higher activity (66.47%) was observed in Morchella esculenta at a maximum concentration. Similarly, the dose-dependent concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 mu g) were also used for other four EMs. Pleurotus ostreatus exhibited 36.13% activity, P. ostreatus (Black (B)) exhibited 30.64%, P. ostreatus (Yellow (Y)) exhibited 40.75% and Pleurotus sajor-caju exhibited 47.39% activity at higher concentrations. Furthermore, the antimicrobial potential were investigated for its toxicity against gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumonia, Erwinia carotovora and Agrobacterium tumifaciens), gram-positive bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrophaeus and Staphylococcus aureus) and a fungal strain (Candida albicans) in comparison with standard antibiotics. Antimicrobial screening revealed that the ethanol extract of P. ostreatus was active against all microorganism tested except E. coli. Maximum zone of inhibition (13 mm) was observed against fungus and A. tumifaciens. P. sajor-caju showed best activities (12.5 mm) against B. subtilis, B. atrophaeus and K. pneumonia. P. ostreatus (Y) showed best activities against P. aeroginosa (21.83 mm), B. atrophaeus (20 mm) and C. albicans (21 mm). P. ostreatus (B) exhibited best activities against C. albicans (16 mm) and slightly lower activities against all other microbes except S. typhi. M. esculenta possess maximum activities in terms of inhibition zone against all microorganisms tested except S. typhi.",0
"The RNA chaperone Hfq acts as a central player in post-transcriptional gene regulation in several Gram-negative Bacteria, whereas comparatively little is known about its role in Gram-positive Bacteria. Here, we studied the function of Hfq in Bacillus subtilis, and show that it confers a survival advantage. A comparative transcriptome analysis revealed mRNAs with a differential abundance that are governed by the ResD-ResE system required for aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Expression of resD was found to be up-regulated in the hfq(-) strain. Furthermore, several genes of the GerE and ComK regulons were de-regulated in the hfq(-) background. Surprisingly, only six out of >100 known and predicted small RNAs (sRNAs) showed altered abundance in the absence of Hfq. Moreover, Hfq positively affected the transcript abundance of genes encoding type I toxin-antitoxin systems. Taken the moderate effect on sRNA levels and mRNAs together, it seems rather unlikely that Hfq plays a central role in RNA transactions in Bacillus subtilis.",0
"Trichoderma harzianum is an important fungus that well known for their ability to produce a wide range of secondary metabolite, antibiotic substance and cell-wall degrading enzyme (CWDE) against phytopathogenic fungi. However, information on the antimicrobial agent in T. harzianum isolate T9 has not been reported. Hence, this research is the first report about antibiotic activity of Trichoderma metabolites against human pathogenic bacteria and enterobacteria. Data for antimicrobial activity were measured at 3 (TS3), 6 (TS6), 9 (TS9), 12 (TS12) and 15 (TS15) days after culture. All culture supernatants from each culture day showed broad-spectrum activity in inhibiting growth of human pathogens and enterobacteria. Especially, inhibiting the growth of Salmonella typhi ATCC5784, this is a human-specific pathogen. Moreover, it was stable to thermal and pronase digestion. Therefore, these culture supernatants were further characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and proteomics analysis. The TLC fractions activity shows that their activity was loss when compared with the crude compound. Due to the higher antimicrobial activity of TS3 and TS12, their fractions were chosen for further purification by C-18 Reversed-phase HPLC. The results showed that antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 of these samples was found only one peak of TS3 (F1) and two peaks of TS12 (F1 and F2). Additionally, proteomics analysis shows that the secreted proteins in log and early late log phase appeared to be a proteases enzyme. From our results, it is likely that T. harzianum isolate T9 against human pathogenic bacteria and enterobacteria with multiple mechanisms including release of antimicrobial agent and CWDE.",0
"The effects of fungicides and biofungicides applied as foliar sprays to potatoes during the growing season in combination with storage loading applications to control Fusarium dry rot in stored potato tubers were evaluated. The in-season treatments included in-furrow and foliar application of mefenoxam or phosphorous acid and foliar application of Bacillus subtilis. Storage treatments included phosphorous acid, B. subtilis and a 3-way mixture of azoxystrobin, fludioxonil and difenoconazole. The experiment utilized two storage temperatures, 10 degrees C (on cv. FL1879) and 4 degrees C (on cv. Goldrush). There was a significant interaction between field and storage treatment for Fusarium dry rot incidence. Field treatment with B. subtilis or mefenoxam followed by storage treatment with B. subtilis, the 3-way mixture of azoxystrobin, fludioxonil and difenoconazole or phosphorous acid resulted in reduced dry rot incidence. Field treatment strategies combined with storage applied fungicides and biofungicides were viable options for controlling dry rot incidence and could be adopted in potato production.

"D-Glutamate is an essential component of bacterial peptidoglycan and a building block of the poly-gamma-D-glutamic acid (PDGA) capsule of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Earlier work suggested that two glutamate racemases, encoded by racE1 and racE2, are each essential for growth of B. anthracis, supplying D-glutamic acid for the synthesis of peptidoglycan and PDGA capsule. Earlier work could not explain, however, why two enzymes that catalyze the same reaction may be needed for bacterial growth. Here, we report that deletion of racE1 or racE2 did not prevent growth of B. anthracis Sterne (pXO1(+) pXO2(-)), the noncapsulating vaccine strain, or of B. anthracis Ames (pXO1(+) pXO2(-)), a fully virulent, capsulating isolate. While mutants with deletions in racE1 and racE2 were not viable, racE2 deletion delayed vegetative growth of B. anthracis following spore germination and caused aberrant cell shapes, phenotypes that were partially restored by exogenous D-glutamate. Deletion of racE1 or racE2 from B. anthracis Ames did not affect the production or stereochemical composition of the PDGA capsule. A model is presented whereby B. anthracis, similar to Bacillus subtilis, utilizes two functionally redundant racemase enzymes to synthesize D-glutamic acid for peptidoglycan synthesis. IMPORTANCE Glutamate racemases, enzymes that convert L-glutamate to D-glutamate, are targeted for antibiotic development. Glutamate racemase inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of bacterial infections such as anthrax, where the causative agent, B. anthracis, requires D-glutamate for the synthesis of peptidoglycan and poly-gamma-D-glutamic acid (PDGA) capsule. Here we show that B. anthracis possesses two glutamate racemase genes that can be deleted without abolishing either bacterial growth or PDGA synthesis. These data indicate that drug candidates must inhibit both glutamate racemases, RacE1 and RacE2, in order to block B. anthracis growth and achieve therapeutic efficacy.",0
"Biofilms represent the predominant mode of microbial growth in the natural environment. Bacillus subtilis is a ubiquitous Gram-positive soil bacterium that functions as an effective plant growth-promoting agent. The biofilm matrix is composed of an exopolysaccharide and an amyloid fiber-forming protein, TasA, and assembles with the aid of a small secreted protein, BslA. Here we show that natively synthesized and secreted BslA forms surface layers around the biofilm. Biophysical analysis demonstrates that BslA can self-assemble at interfaces, forming an elastic film. Molecular function is revealed from analysis of the crystal structure of BslA, which consists of an Ig-type fold with the addition of an unusual, extremely hydrophobic ""cap"" region. A combination of in vivo biofilm formation and in vitro biophysical analysis demonstrates that the central hydrophobic residues of the cap are essential to allow a hydrophobic, nonwetting biofilm to form as they control the surface activity of the BslA protein. The hydrophobic cap exhibits physiochemical properties remarkably similar to the hydrophobic surface found in fungal hydrophobins; thus, BslA is a structurally defined bacterial hydrophobin. We suggest that biofilms formed by other species of bacteria may have evolved similar mechanisms to provide protection to the resident bacterial community.",0
"Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) is an exoribonuclease that catalyzes the processive phosphorolytic degradation of RNA from the 3-end. The enzyme catalyzes also the reverse reaction of polymerization of nucleoside diphosphates that has been implicated in the generation of heteropolymeric tails at the RNA 3-end. The enzyme is widely conserved and plays a major role in RNA decay in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, it participates in maturation and quality control of stable RNA. PNPase autoregulates its own expression at post-transcriptional level through a complex mechanism that involves the endoribonuclease RNase III and translation control. The activity of PNPase is modulated in an intricate and still unclear manner by interactions with small molecules and recruitment in different multiprotein complexes. Not surprisingly, given the wide spectrum of PNPase substrates, PNPase-defective mutations in different bacterial species have pleiotropic effects and perturb the execution of genetic programs involving drastic changes in global gene expression such as biofilm formation, growth at suboptimal temperatures, and virulence.

"Ethidium bromide (EtBr) is a strong DNA binder and has been widely used to probe DNA structure in drug-DNA and protein-DNA interaction. Four new charge-transfer (CT) complexes consisting of EtBr as donor and quinol (QL), picric acid (PA), tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) or dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ) as acceptors, were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, electronic absorption, spectrophotometric titration, IR, Raman, H-1 NMR and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) techniques. The stoichiometry of these complexes was found to be 1:2 ratio and having the formula [(EtBr)(acceptor)]. The thermal stability of the synthesized CT complexes was investigated using thermogravimetric (TG) analyses, and the morphology and particle size of these complexes were obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The CT complexes were also tested for its antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and two Gram-negative bacteria; Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeuroginosa strains by using Tetracycline as standard and antifungal property against Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans by using amphotericin B as standard. The results were compared with the standard drugs and significant conclusions were obtained. The results indicated that the [(EtBr)(QL)(2)] complex had exerted excellent inhibitory activity against the growth of the tested bacterial strains. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Lichenysin produced by 53 different Bacillus licheniformis strains has been structurally examined with a qualitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The same lichenysin isoforms are produced from all strains, indicating that the growth conditions have a stronger influence on the lipopeptide production than the genotype. A rapid method for the quantification of lichenysin from bacterial cell cultures with LC-MS/MS after a simple methanol extraction has been refined. For the first time commercially available lichenysin has been used as calibrant, making quantification more accurate. The trueness for C15-lichenysin has been improved to 94% using matrix-matched calibration with lichenysin compared with 30% using solvent calibration with surfactin. The quantitative method was fully validated based on Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The LOD of the method was below 1 mu gg(-1) and the repeatability ranged from 10% to 16%.",0
"The current work deals with the studies on characterization of two biofilm-forming bacteria isolated from the oral cavity. The major constituent of biofilm other than bacterial cells is the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, which is secreted by the bacterial cells themselves. Physical properties of biofilms such as attachment, mechanical strength, antibiotic resistance can be attributed to EPS matrix. Molecular phylogeny confirmed these two isolates as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. It was observed that cell attachment in both the strains was maximal when xylose was used as the sole carbon source. The EPS characterization result indicated the presence of a macromolecular complex constituting of carbohydrate, protein, lipids and nucleic acids. Test for biofilm formation in the presence of metal salts of iron and zinc showed moderate to high inhibition of biofilm formation. However, calcium, iron and copper have been found to enhance biofilm growth significantly. There was more than 50 % increase in biofilm growth by P. aeruginosa with an increase in calcium concentration up to 80 ppm (Two tailed t-test P < 0.05), whereas a parts per thousand yen 15 % increase in biofilm growth by B. subtilis was observed in the presence of 80 ppm of calcium. However, variations were significant (Two way ANOVA, P < 0.01) between different metals in different concentrations. In this study, attempts have been made to examine the effect of different carbon sources and physiological conditions on biofilm growth.",1
"This research article reports the synthesis of 4,6-bis(5-aryl/heteroaryl-1,2-oxazol-3-yl)benzene-1,3-diol 4a-4f and 4,6-bis(5-aryl/heteroaryl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzene-1,3-diol 5a-5f from 1,1'-(4,6-dihydroxybenzene-1,3-diyl)bis(3-aryl/heteroarylpropane-1,3-dio ne) 3a-3f.

"Equisetum hyemale species is considered a medicinal plant used in the form of infusions to combat infectious or inflammation diseases and also diuretic effects, presenting several compounds related to these actions. In previous studies different species of Equisetum showed several phenolic compounds. The objective of this study was, for the first time, based on phytochemistry analysis to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. The 70% ethanolic and methanolic extracts of E. hyemale were characterized by spectrophotometric and high-performance liquid chromatography with pulsed amperometric detector analyses, as well as its antioxidant potential based on the scavenger activity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). In addition was verified the antimicrobial activity by broth microdilution technique against bacteria and fungi. The extracts showed phytochemical similarity, which demonstrated the presence of phenolic compounds, the scavenging activity for free radicals was about 30% and was observed better antifungal activity against dermatophyte fungi, with minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of 0.62 mg/mL to Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum canis. The extracts exhibits great potential to therapeutic applications or product development, since both possess antifungal activity and antioxidant action associated with little difference in their phytochemical composition.",0
"Antimicrobial investigation of the leaf and stem bark extracts of Bligha sapida was carried out against pathogenic bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae) and fungi ( Candida albicans, Microsporum canis, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus). The two extracts did not exert antifungal effect on any of the tested fungal species, at the concentrations used in this study but exhibited activity against S. aureus and B. subtilis but not against E. coli and S. dysenteriae. The stem bark extract was more potent than the leaf extract. The highest stem bark extract concentration (200 mg/ml) resulted in inhibition zone diameter (IZD) of 14.33+0.57 and 15.00+0.00 for S. aureus and B. subtilis respectively, whereas the same concentration of the leaf extract resulted in IZD of 10.66+1.15 and 9.33+0.98 for S. aureus and B. subtilis respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 12.5 mg/ml, and 100 mg/ml were obtained for the stem bark extract assayed against B. subtilis and S. aureus, respectively. With the same extract, minimum bactericidal concentrations of 25 and >100 mg/ml were obtained for B. subtilis and S. aureus respectively. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of saponins, anthraquinones, cardiac glycosides and flavonoids in both extracts. Alkaloids, tannins, phlobatannins and terpenes were also detected in the leaves. Results obtained, explains why parts of this plant are used traditionally for the treatment of various infections.",0
"Much research has been focused on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) derived from insect immune defense reactions due to their potential in the development of new antibiotics. In this study, a new AMP from the insect Paederus dermatitis, named sarcotoxin Pd was identified and purified using gel filtration and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Our results showed that this peptide has broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on examined microbes. Sarcotoxin Pd is composed of 34 amino acids and its molecular weight was estimated to be 3613.26 +/- A 0.5 Da. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of sarcotoxin Pd against Gram-negative bacteria were lower than Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The identified peptide showed the highest antimicrobial effect against Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli. This peptide did not reveal significant hemolytic activity against human red blood cells particularly in the range of MIC values. Confirming the potential antimicrobial activities of synthetic peptide, this paper addresses the role of sarcotoxin Pd in the treatment of systemic microbial illnesses.",0
"The chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oils obtained from the leaves of two different cultivars of Florence fennel cropped under three different fertilization treatments (Control not fertilized; Mineral Fertilization; Compost from Municipal Solid Wastes) have been analyzed. All the oils were characterized by high anethole concentration and some showed also a good percentage of limonene. Thus, the leaves of Florence fennel, which are agricultural wastes, could be used for the recovery of anethole to be used for its flavoring and biomedical properties. The antimicrobial activity expressed by assays on the examined oils indicates an appreciable effect, generally higher on Gram-positive bacteria. The various samples of Florence fennel analyzed did not show any results with FRAP test. The DPPH test showed a weak capacity of the samples to catch the free radicals from the solution, attributable to their content in anethole. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and tumor cell lines, novel antibiotics with antibacterial and cytotoxic activities are urgently needed. Marine actinobacteria are rich sources of novel antibiotics, and here we report the discovery of a novel alkaloid, xinghaiamine A, from a marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces xinghaiensis NRRL B24674(T). Xinghaiamine A was purified from the fermentation broth, and its structure was elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR spectrum as well as mass spectrometry. Xinghaiamine A was identified to be a novel alkaloid with highly symmetric structure on the basis of sulfoxide functional group, and sulfoxide containing compound has so far never been reported in microorganisms. Biological assays revealed that xinghaiamine A exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activities to both Gram-negative persistent hospital pathogens (e. g. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive ones, which include Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. In addition, xinghaiamine A also exhibited potent cytotoxic activity to human cancer cell lines of MCF-7 and U-937 with the IC50 of 0.6 and 0.5 mu M, respectively.",0
"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a significant public health concern and motivate efforts to develop new classes of antibiotics. One such class of antibiotics is the arylomycins, which target type I signal peptidase (SPase), the enzyme responsible for the release of secreted proteins from their N-terminal leader sequences. Despite the essentiality, conservation, and relative accessibility of SPase, the activity of the arylomycins is limited against some bacteria, including the important human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. To understand the origins of the limited activity against S. aureus, we characterized the susceptibility of a panel of strains to two arylomycin derivatives, arylomycin A-C-16 and its more potent analog arylomycin M131. We observed a wide range of susceptibilities to the two arylomycins and found that resistant strains were sensitized by cotreatment with tunicamycin, which inhibits the first step of wall teichoic acid synthesis. To further understand how S. aureus responds to the arylomycins, we profiled the transcriptional response of S. aureus NCTC 8325 to growth-inhibitory concentrations of arylomycin M131 and found that it upregulates the cell wall stress stimulon (CWSS) and an operon consisting of a putative transcriptional regulator and three hypothetical proteins. Interestingly, we found that mutations in the putative transcriptional regulator are correlated with resistance, and selection for resistance ex vivo demonstrated that mutations in this gene are sufficient for resistance. The results begin to elucidate how S. aureus copes with secretion stress and how it evolves resistance to the inhibition of SPase.",0
"The fungus Rhizoctonia solani is one of the causal agents of numerous diseases that affect crop growth and yield. The aim of this present investigation was to identify a biocontrol agent that acts against R. solani and to determine the agent's protective effect through phytohormones and antioxidant regulation in experimentally infected Chinese cabbage plants. Four rhizospheric soil bacterial isolates GR53, GR169, GR786, and GR320 were tested for their antagonistic activity against R. solani. Among these isolates, GR53 significantly suppressed fungal growth. GR53 was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum by phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence. The biocontrol activity of B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum GR53 was tested in Chinese cabbage plants under controlled conditions. Results showed that R. solani inhibited plant growth (length, width, fresh and dry weight of leaves) by reducing chlorophyll and total phenolic content, as well as by increasing the levels of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, and DPPH scavenging activity. By regulating the levels of these compounds, the co-inoculation of B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum GR53 heightened induced systemic resistance in infected Chinese cabbage, effectively mitigating R. solani-induced damaging effects and improving plant growth. The results obtained from this study suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum GR53 is an effective biocontrol agent to prevent the damage caused by R. solani in Chinese cabbage plants.",1
"Background: In Nigeria, Cordia sebestena (Boraginaceae), an understudied medicinal plant, is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. In this study, we investigated the chemical composition, antibacterial potential, and sub-acute toxicity of C. sebestena leaves.Methods: Ethyl acetate extracts were analyzed using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry. The antibacterial potential of the extracts was tested against five standard bacteria, namely Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Clinical observations and blood parameters were used to evaluate the possible toxicity of C. sebestena.Results: The TLC profile yielded 39 fractions, which were pooled to nine combined sub-fractions (A-I). The FTIR spectrum of sub-fraction H indicated the presence of aliphatic C-H stretching vibration at 2922 and 2850 cm(-1), C=O stretch at 1734 and 1708 cm(-1), and C=C stretch of aromatics and aliphatics at 1464 and (shoulder) 1618 cm-1, respectively. The fractions of the C. sebestena ethyl acetate leaf extract showed antibacterial potential across board, but fraction H had the highest antibacterial activity against B. cereus and S. aureus. The study also indicated the relatively low toxicity profile of the ethyl acetate leaf extract of C. sebestena in the liver of rats.Conclusions: The study showed that C. sebestena leaves have strong antibacterial potential and low toxicity, thereby underlying the scientific basis for their folkloric use in the management of microbial infections and its associated complications.",0
"Momordica charantia is a well known plant in Asia including India which posses wide range of pharmacological activities. These drugs have been used in India as folk remedy in the form of decoctions and infusions to treat bacterial infections and also claimed to be an effective against variety of skin conditions like psoriasis, acne, wounds etc. The present investigation is carried out to study the antibacterial activity and the presence of various phytochemicals of different parts of Momordica charantia extracts with different solvents on three microorganisms by disk diffusion method. Methanolic, ethanolic, hexane and aqueous extract of leaves, and fruits of the plant were evaluated for antibacterial activity using the disk diffusion method on three microorganisms ( Bacillus subtilus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi). Zone of inhibition was calculated. Results indicate that the different concentrations of various extracts under study exhibit antibacterial activity and among the various extracts, fruit extracts have shown better activity as compared to leaf parts of extracts. Among the various extracts, methanol extracts have shown better antibacterial activity.",0
"Background: Necrotic enteritis (NE), caused by Clostridium perfringens, has cost the poultry industry $2 billion in losses. This study aimed to investigate the effect of Bacillus licheniformis as dietary supplement on the growth, serum antioxidant status, and expression of lipid-metabolism genes of broiler chickens with C. perfringens-induced NE. Methods: A total of 240 one-day-old broilers were randomly grouped into four: a negative control, an NE experimental model (PC), chickens fed a diet supplemented with 30% of fishmeal from day 14 onwards and challenged with coccidiosis vaccine (FC), and NE group supplied with feed containing 1.0*10 6 CFU/g B. licheniformis (BL). Results: Body weight gain, feed conversion ratio, serum antioxidant status, and lipid-metabolism-gene expression were analyzed. In the PC group, FCR increased significantly whereas serum catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity decreased compared with NC group. Dietary B. licheniformis supplementation improved FCR and oxidative stress in experimental avian NE. Using Bacillus licheniformis as a direct-fed microbial (DFM) could also significantly upregulate catabolism-related genes, namely, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, in livers and changed the expression of lipid-anabolism genes. Conclusion: These results suggested that dietary B. licheniformis supplementation can enhance growth and antioxidant ability, as well as change the expression of genes related to fatty-acid synthesis and oxidation in the livers of NE-infected broilers.",0
"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used as antibacterial and antifungal agents in agriculture. Nevertheless, these nanoparticles with newborn properties pose a potential risk to the environment, Due to contact with crops and bacteria that are beneficial to the soil. This study is based on the examination of the phytotoxic effects of AgNPs on Oryza sativa L. and some of its rhizosphere bacteria, by physiological and biochemical assays. In order to study the complex interaction of the AgNPs life expectancy that are mixed with culture medium, the incubation time for the fresh mixture, 7, 14 and 21 days old of AgNPs, on the seedlings growth was investigated. Results indicated that plant's response to the treatment with AgNPs affected on the cell wall, and that with an increase in its concentration (up to 60 mu g/mL). The obtained results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibited that those particles not only penetrated the cell wall, but they could also damage the cell morphology and its structural features. AgNPs treatment up to 30 mu g/mL accelerated root growth and at 60 mu g/mL was able to restrict a root's ability to grow. The 30 mu g/mL treatment had significant effect on root branching and dry weight. In contrast, shoot growth was more susceptible to the effects of AgNPs treatment. The root content for total soluble carbohydrates and starch demonstrated that despite stable starch content, total soluble carbohydrates showed the tendency to significantly decline in response to AgNPs. However, induction of root branching and photosynthetic pigments can attributed to AgNPs stress based on evidence from the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and local root tissue death. Nine isolates of the genus Bacillus selected and identified according to morphological and chemotaxonomic methods. The AgNPs treatment revolutionized the populations of bacteria as Bacillus thuringiensis SBURR1 was totally eliminated, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SBURR5 became the most populated one. Images from an electron microscope and the leakage of reducing sugars and protein through the bacterial membrane, similarly confirmed the ""pit"" formation mechanism of the AgNPs. Moreover the hypothesis from the growth curve study demonstrated that AgNPs may damage bacterium cell wall and transform them to protoplasts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"The overall erythromycin biosynthetic pathway can be sub-divided into macrocyclic polyketide formation and polyketide tailoring to produce the final bioactive molecule. In this study, the native deoxysugar tailoring reactions were exchanged for the purpose of demonstrating the production of alternative final erythromycin compounds. Both the D-desosamine and L-mycarose deoxysugar pathways were replaced with the alternative D-mycaminose and D-olivose pathways to produce new erythromycin analogues through the Escherichia coli heterologous system. Both analogues exhibited bioactivity against multiple antibiotic-resistant Bacillus subtilis strains. Besides demonstrating an intrinsic flexibility for the biosynthetic system to accommodate alternative tailoring pathways, the results offer an initial attempt to leverage the E. coli platform for erythromycin analogue production.

"Staphylococcus aureus is a leading pathogen for animals and humans, not only being one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in hospital-associated infections but also causing diseases in the community. To coordinate the expression of its numerous virulence genes for growth and survival, S. aureus uses various signalling pathways that include two-component regulatory systems, transcription factors, and also around 250 regulatory RNAs. Biological roles have only been determined for a handful of these sRNAs, including cis, trans, and cis-trans acting RNAs, some internally encoding small, functional peptides and others possessing dual or multiple functions. Here we put forward an inventory of these fascinating sRNAs; the proteins involved in their activities; and those involved in stress response, metabolisms, and virulence.",0
"We have used protein electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels derivatized with the proprietary ligand Phos-tag to separate the response regulator BvgA from its phosphorylated counterpart BvgA approximate to P. This approach has allowed us to readily ascertain the degree of phosphorylation of BvgA in in vitro reactions, or in crude lysates of Bordetella pertussis grown under varying laboratory conditions. We have used this technique to examine the kinetics of BvgA phosphorylation after shift of B.pertussis cultures from non-permissive to permissive conditions, or of its dephosphorylation following a shift from permissive to non-permissive conditions. Our results provide the first direct evidence that levels of BvgA approximate to Pin vivo correspond temporally to the expression of early and late BvgA-regulated virulence genes. We have also examined a number of other aspects of BvgA function predicted from previous studies and by analogy with other two-component response regulators. These include the site of BvgA phosphorylation, the exclusive role of the cognate BvgS sensor kinase in its phosphorylation in Bordetella pertussis, and the effect of the T194M mutation on phosphorylation. We also detected the phosphorylation of a small but consistent fraction of BvgA purified after expression in Escherichia coli.",0
"In this study, cellulase-assisted extraction of water soluble polysaccharides from pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) and their antibacterial activity were investigated. The polysaccharides yield was monitored during the extraction process. The optimum extraction conditions were determined as follows: time, 40 min; temperature, 55 C; pH, 4.5; and cellulase amount, 4000 U/g. The extracts were centrifuged, filtered, proteins removed by Sevag method, concentrated to similar to 15% (w/v), precipitated with 5 volumes of absolute ethanol, freeze-dried, and pulverized to yield a water soluble powder of pumpkin polysaccharides (PP). The sugar content of the product was 68.3%, and the yield was 17.34% (w/w), respectively. The PP had high antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli at the concentration of 100 mg/mL. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Transfusion associated sepsis cases are encountered occasionally and bacterial transmission remains the major cause. The goal of our study was to compare the efficacy of disinfectants in phlebotomy site preparation. After selection of donor the antecubital fossa area of the arm was disinfected with different types of disinfectants namely sprit (70% isopropyl alcohol), povidone iodine (0.5% w/v available iodine in distilled water), savlon (1.5% v/v chlorhexidine gluconate solution and 3.0% cetrimide solution) and combination of sprit and povidone iodine. Swabs were collected from 20 donors using a sterile forceps, after cleaning with different antiseptic solutions. Swab was streaked on blood agar plate aseptically and the plate was incubated at 37A degrees C for 24 h. Colonies were counted and a single colony was re-cultured by growing on nutrient and Mac-Conkey agar. The biochemical characteristics were determined by performing Gram staining, Motility, Catalase and Oxidase tests. The mean values of colonies were significantly higher with savlon compared to other three solutions. The difference was statistically significant by ""t"" test (t values 1.7-3.0; P < 0.05). Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Micrococcus sp., Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cereus were the organisms identified. After completion of bleeding, samples from the bag were aseptically inoculated in aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles to be tested on BacT/Alert system. The bag containing donor's blood did not show any contamination when three cleanings were carried out using sprit, povidone iodine and spirit respectively.",0
"Microbial RNA is an important stimulator of innate immune responses. Differences in posttranscriptional RNA modification profiles enable the immune system to discriminate between self and non-self nucleic acids. This principle may be exploited by certain bacteria to circumvent immune cell activation. In this regard, 2'-O-methylation of Escherichia coli tRNA(Tyr) at position 18 (Gm18) has recently been described to inhibit TLR7-mediated IFN-alpha production in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Extending these findings, we now demonstrate that Gm18 also potently inhibits TLR7-independent human monocyte activation by RNA derived from a variety of bacterial strains. The half minimal inhibitory concentration values were similar to those found for IFN-alpha inhibition in pDCs. Mechanistically, 2'-O-methylated RNA impaired upstream signalling events, including MAP kinase and NF kappa B activation. Our results suggest that antagonizing effects of Gm18-modified RNA are due to competition with stimulatory RNA for receptor binding. The antagonistic effect was specific for RNA because the small molecule TLR7/8 agonist R848 was not inhibited. Despite the striking phenotype in human cells, 2'-O-methylated RNA did not interfere with TLR13 activation by bacterial 23S rRNA in murine DC and BMDM. Thus, we identify here Gm18 in E. coli tRNA(Tyr) as a universal suppressor of innate immune activation in the human but not the murine system. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel",0
"Jatropha curcas seed cake is a by-product generated from oil extraction of J. curcas seed. Although it contains a high amount of protein, it has phorbol esters and anti-nutritional factors such as phytate, trypsin inhibitor, lectin and saponin. It cannot be applied directly in the food or animal feed industries. This investigation was aimed at detoxifying the toxic and anti-nutritional compounds in J. curcas seed cake by fermentation with Bacillus spp. Two GRAS (generally recognized as safe) Bacillus strains used in the study were Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis with solid-state and submerged fermentations. Solid-state fermentation was done on 10 g of seed cake with a moisture content of 70% for 7 days, while submerged fermentation was carried out on 10 g of seed cake in 100 ml distilled water for 5 days. The fermentations were incubated at the optimum condition of each strain. After fermentation, bacterial growth, pH, toxic and anti-nutritional compounds were determined. Results showed that B. licheniformis with submerged fermentation were the most effective method to degrade toxic and anti-nutritional compounds in the seed cake. After fermentation, phorbol esters, phytate and trypsin inhibitor were reduced by 62%, 42% and 75%, respectively, while lectin could not be eliminated. The reduction of phorbol esters, phytate and trypsin inhibitor was related to esterase, phytase and protease activities, respectively. J. curcas seed cake could be mainly detoxified by bacterial fermentation and the high-protein fermented seed cake could be potentially applied to animal feed.

"A novel bacteriophage that infects S. aureus, SA97, was isolated and characterized. The phage SA97 belongs to the Siphoviridae family, and the cell wall teichoic acid (WTA) was found to be a host receptor of the phage SA97. Genome analysis revealed that SA97 contains 40,592 bp of DNA encoding 54 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), and none of these genes were related to virulence or drug resistance. Although a few genes associated with lysogen formation were detected in the phage SA97 genome, the phage SA97 produced neither lysogen nor transductant in S. aureus. These results suggest that the phage SA97 may be a promising candidate for controlling S. aureus.",0
"Biofilms are characteristic of some chronic or recurrent infections and this mode of growth tends to reduce treatment efficacy. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is associated with a high rate of recurrent symptomatic disease. The presence and behaviour of C. difficile within intestinal biofilms remains largely unexplored, but may factor in recurrent infection. A triple-stage chemostat gut model designed to facilitate the formation of intestinal biofilm was inoculated with a pooled human faecal emulsion. Bacterial populations were allowed to equilibrate before simulated CDI was induced by clindamycin (33.9 mg/L, four times daily, 7 days) and subsequently treated with vancomycin (125 mg/L, four times daily, 7 days). Indigenous gut microbiota, C. difficile total viable counts, spores, cytotoxin and antimicrobial activity in planktonic and biofilm communities were monitored during the 10 week experimental period. Vancomycin successfully treated the initial episode of simulated CDI, but similar to 18 days after therapy cessation, recurrent infection occurred. Germination, proliferation and toxin production were evident within planktonic communities in both initial and recurrent CDI. In contrast, sessile C. difficile remained in dormant spore form for the duration of the experiment. The effects of and recovery from clindamycin and vancomycin exposure for sessile populations was delayed compared with responses for planktonic bacteria. Intestinal biofilms provide a potential reservoir for C. difficile spore persistence, possibly facilitating their dispersal into the gut lumen after therapeutic intervention, leading to recurrent infection. Therapeutic options for CDI could have increased efficacy if they are more effective against sessile C. difficile.",0
"Rapid, specific and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria is crucial for public health and safety. Bacillus cereus is harmful as it causes foodborne illness and a number of systemic and local infections. We report a novel phage endolysin cell wall-binding domain (CBD) for B. cereus and the development of a highly specific and sensitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based B. cereus detection method using the CBD. The newly discovered CBD from endolysin of PBC1, a B. cereus-specific bacteriophage, provides high specificity and binding capacity to B. cereus. By using the CBD-modified SPR chips, B. cereus can be detected at the range of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/ml. More importantly, the detection limit can be improved to 10(2) CFU/ml by using a subtractive inhibition assay based on the pre-incubation of B. cereus and CBDs, removal of CBD-bound B. cereus, and SPR detection of the unbound CBDs. The present study suggests that the small and genetically engineered CBDs can be promising biological probes for B. cereus. We anticipate that the CBD-based SPR-sensing methods will be useful for the sensitive, selective, and rapid detection of B. cereus.",0
"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection and its associated hand-foot-mouth disease is a significant public health problem. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel vaccine to prevent EV71 infection. Bacillus subtilis spores were engineered to express VP1 protein of EV71 with CotB as carrier protein. The recombination was tested in adult mice for the ability to induce immune responses. Mice were inoculated orally and intranasally simultaneously with the spores. The vaccine's efficacy on stimulating immune responses was evaluated by measuring the titer of anti-VP1 IgG and IgA with enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA), and the number of VP1-specific T cells by ELIS-POT. Serum titers of IgG (0.41 +/- 0.05 vs 0.20 +/- 0.07) and IgA (0.24 +/- 0.02 vs 0.11 +/- 0.01) in mice immunized with recombinant CotB-VP1 spores were higher than that of mice immunized with nonrecombinant spores 1A771. Splenocytes from the group of mice receiving VP1 spores vaccination contained 1.69 +/- 0.52/10(4) VP1-specific T cells, which was greater than the 0.06 +/- 0.06/10(4) cells from the group of mice receiving nonrecombinant spores vaccination. In conclusion, B. subtilis spores displaying VP1 of EV71 are effective in stimulating cellular immunity and humoral immunity in mice.",0
"An antibacterial-substance-producing bacterium, namely, strain F412, was isolated from a traditional Myanmar shrimp product fermented with boiled rice. It was a gram-positive, spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium, and identified as Bacillus mojavensis on the basis of the gyrA sequence. The antibacterial substance of this strain was partially purified from a culture supernatant using two steps of column chromatography. This substance was found to be widely effective against gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes. The antibacterial activity of this substance was not susceptible to treatments with several proteolytic enzymes. The antibacterial activity gradually decreased with increasing treatment temperature, but it remained even after heating for 15 min at 121 A degrees C. This antibacterial substance showed different molecular weights, as shown by the results of gel filtration and electrophoresis analyses. Staining results after electrophoresis suggest that the antibacterial substance might be a glycopeptide with an estimated molecular weight between 3.5 and 8.5 kDa. From the decrease in optical density of a culture of the L. monocytogenes treated with this antibacterial substance, it was suggested that this substance might have bacteriolytic activity.",0
"A series of new carbazole derivatives of ursolic acid were designed and synthesized in an attempt to develop potent antimicrobial or antitumor agents. Their structures were confirmed by using IR, HRMS and H-1 NMR analysis. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four bacterial and three fungal strains using serial dilution method. Compounds 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b and 5a-f exhibited significant antibacterial activity against at least one tested bacteria with MIC values of 3.9-15.6 mu g/ml. In addition, the in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds were also assayed against two human tumor cell lines (SMMC-7721 and HepG2) using MTT colorimetric method. From the results, compounds 5a-e and 5h displayed pronounced cytotoxic activity with IC50 values below 10 lM. Specially, compound 5e was found to be the most potent compound with IC50 values of 1.08 +/- 0.22 and 1.26 +/- 0.17 mu M against SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells, respectively, comparable to those of doxorubicin. In addition, compound 5e showed reduced cytotoxicity against noncancerous LO2 cells with IC50 value of 5.75 +/- 0.48 mu M. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Background: This study was subjected to investigate different pharmacological properties of ethanol extract of Solena amplexicaulis root. Results: The extract contains flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin and steroid compounds. The extract exhibited excellent antioxidant activity in DPPH radical scavenging activity. The extract also showed potent activity in brine shrimp lethality bioassay. The LC50 value was found to 44.677 mu g/ml. The extract showed better anti-bacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria. In antifungal assay, the maximum 79.31% of anti-mycotic activity was observed against Aspergillus ochraceus while minimum 44.2% against Rhizopus oryzae. MIC value ranged between 1500-3000 mu g/ml. The extract was found moderately toxic with a 24-hr LD50 value of 81.47 mg/kg in Swiss albino mice. The degree of inhibition by the ethanolic extract of the root was found less than that of standard analgesic drug diclofenac sodium. The extract also showed moderate anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activity and anti-diabetic property. Reducing power of the extract was comparable with standard ascorbic acid. Moderate in vitro thrombolytic activity, lipid peroxidation inhibition property, metal chelating ability and stress-protective activity was also observed. Conclusion: Ethanol extract of Solena amplexicaulis root can be valuable for treatment of different diseases.",0
"Bacillus subtilis is a vaccine production host and delivery vector with several advantages such as a low production cost, straightforward administration as it is safe for human consumption and the production of spores exerting adjuvant effects. This review summarizes the expression approaches and provides an updated outlook of how a myriad of pathogens have been targeted under this technology. Furthermore, by reviewing the literature, several promising candidates in terms of immunogenic and immunoprotective potential have been identified. The immune profiles achieved comprise either humoral or cellular responses, which reflect versatility for application in the fight of distinct pathologies that demand specific polarization on the immune responses. Some perspectives for this field are also envisioned.",0
"During exposure to certain stresses, bacteria dimerize pairs of 70S ribosomes into translationally silent 100S particles in a process called ribosome hibernation. Although the biological roles of ribosome hibernation are not completely understood, this process appears to represent a conserved and adaptive response that contributes to optimal survival during stress and post-exponential-phase growth. Hibernating ribosomes are formed by the activity of one or more highly conserved proteins; gammaproteobacteria produce two relevant proteins, ribosome modulation factor (RMF) and hibernation promoting factor (HPF), while most Gram-positive bacteria produce a single, longer HPF protein. Here, we report the formation of 100S ribosomes by an HPF homolog in Listeria monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes 100S ribosomes were observed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of bacterial extracts during mid-logarithmic phase, peaked at the transition to stationary phase, and persisted at lower levels during post-exponential-phase growth. 100S ribosomes were undetectable in bacteria carrying an hpf:: Himar1 transposon insertion, indicating that HPF is required for ribosome hibernation in L. monocytogenes. Additionally, epitope-tagged HPF cosedimented with 100S ribosomes, supporting its previously described direct role in 100S formation. We examined hpf mRNA by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and identified several conditions that upregulated its expression, including carbon starvation, heat shock, and exposure to high concentrations of salt or ethanol. Survival of HPF-deficient bacteria was impaired under certain conditions both in vitro and during animal infection, providing evidence for the biological relevance of 100S ribosome formation.",0
"The envelope of Bacillus anthracis encompasses a proteinaceous S-layer with two S-layer proteins (Sap and EA1). Protein assembly in the envelope of B. anthracis requires S-layer homology domains (SLH) within S-layer proteins and S-layer-associated proteins (BSLs), which associate with the secondary cell wall polysaccharide (SCWP), an acetylated carbohydrate that is tethered to peptidoglycan. Here, we investigated the contributions of two putative acetyltransferases, PatA1 and PatA2, on SCWP acetylation and S-layer assembly. We show that mutations in patA1 and patA2 affect the chain lengths of B. anthracis vegetative forms and perturb the deposition of the BslO murein hydrolase at cell division septa. The patA1 and patA2 mutants are defective for the assembly of EA1 in the envelope but retain the ability of S-layer formation with Sap. SCWP isolated from the patA1 patA2 mutant lacked acetyl moieties identified in wild-type polysaccharide and failed to associate with the SLH domains of EA1. A model is discussed whereby patA1- and patA2-mediated acetylation of SCWP enables the deposition of EA1 as well as BslO near the septal region of the B. anthracis envelope.",0
"To examine if the molecular chaperone DnaK operon proteins of Streptococcus suis type 2 (SS2) are involved in adhesion to host cells, the abundance values of these proteins from the surface of two SS2 strains of different adhesion capability were compared. Their roles in growth and adhesion to human laryngeal epithelial cell line HEp-2 cells were investigated on SS2 strain HA9801 and its mutants with DnaK operon genes partially knocked-out (PKO mutant) under heat stress. The major difference was that DnaJ was more abundant in strain HA9801 than in strain JX0811. Pretreatment of the bacteria with hyperimmune sera to DnaJ, but not with those to other proteins, could significantly reduce SS2 adhesion to HEp-2 cells. PKO of dnaJ gene resulted in decreased SS2 growth at 37 degrees C and 42 degrees C, and reduced its adhesion to HEp-2 cells. The wild-type strain stressed at 42 degrees C had increased expression of DnaJ on its surface and elevated adhesion to HEp-2 cells, which was also inhibitable by DnaJ specific antiserum. These results indicate that the DnaJ of S. suis type 2 is important not only for thermotolerance but also for adhesion to host cells. Because DnaJ expression is increased upon temperature upshift with increased exposure on the bacterial surface, the febrile conditions of the cases with systemic infections might help facilitate bacterial adhesion to host cells. DnaJ could be one of the potential candidates as a subunit vaccine because of its good immunogenicity.",0
"To understand living cells, we need knowledge of each of their parts as well as about the interactions of these parts. To gain rapid and comprehensive access to this information, annotation databases are required. Here, we present SubtiWiki 2.0, the integrated database for the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis (http://subtiwiki.uni-goettingen.de/). SubtiWiki provides text-based access to published information about the genes and proteins of B. subtilis as well as presentations of metabolic and regulatory pathways. Moreover, manually curated protein-protein interactions diagrams are linked to the protein pages. Finally, expression data are shown with respect to gene expression under 104 different conditions as well as absolute protein quantification for cytoplasmic proteins. To facilitate the mobile use of SubtiWiki, we have now expanded it by Apps that are available for iOS and Android devices. Importantly, the App allows to link private notes and pictures to the gene/protein pages. Today, SubtiWiki has become one of the most complete collections of knowledge on a living organism in one single resource.",0
"Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCh)-silver nanoparticle (Ag) hydrogels with high antibacterial activity against three Gram +ve bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecalis), three Gram -ve bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and a Candida albicans fungus were prepared. The in situ preparation reaction involved crosslinking of CMCh with epichlorohydrin in alkaline medium containing silver nitrate to yield silver nanoparticles loaded CMCh hydrogel giving pale brown or darker hydrogels when the silver content increases. FTIR spectroscopy, SEM and TEM were done for the prepared hydrogels. Silver nanoparticles hydrogels exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than virgin CMCh. TEM analysis showed the small size of the prepared hydrogels to be in the range of 9-16 nm in size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Forty-four isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis like bacteria from various sources in different locations from Sudan were tested for their insecticidal activity. The toxicity of these isolates ranged from 6.6 to 70% to the neonates of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera at 10 ppm concentration. The most effective ones are Kb-29, St-6 and Wh-1 comparable with HD-1. Toxicity of isolates to larvae of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum ranged from 20 to 100%. Isolates St-2 and St-23 gave 100% larval mortality within 15 days of exposure and were at par with Ab-8, Ab-12, Kb-26, Kb-30, Om-4, Po-2, Po-5, Po-7, Sa-8 and Wh-5 and were also comparable with E. coli clone expressing Cry3 toxin. The most effective five isolates viz., Kb-29, St-2, St-6, St-23 and Wh-1 belonged to B. thuringiensis. The St-6 isolate, which also showed high toxicity to T. castaneum larvae, had cry1 genes along with coleopteran active cry28 genes, but not cry3 genes. Of the 25 isolates characterized with 16s DNA sequencing, seven belonged to Paenibacillus spp., one Lysinibacillus sphaericus, one Bacillus pumilus, four Bacillus spp., and rest 12 belonged to B. thuringiensis. Biochemical characterization in each species showed variation. The present study shows potential of some isolates like Kb-29, St-2, St-6, St-23 and Wh-1 as promising bioinsecticides.",0
"Phosphatidylcholine (PC), a common phospholipid of the eukaryotic cell membrane, is present in the cell envelope of the intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus, the etiological agent of bovine brucellosis. In this pathogen, the biosynthesis of PC proceeds mainly through the phosphatidylcholine synthase pathway; hence, it relies on the presence of choline in the milieu. These observations imply that B. abortus encodes an as-yet-unknown choline uptake system. Taking advantage of the requirement of choline uptake for PC synthesis, we devised a method that allowed us to identify a homologue of ChoX, the high-affinity periplasmic binding protein of the ABC transporter ChoXWV. Disruption of the choX gene completely abrogated PC synthesis at low choline concentrations in the medium, thus indicating that it is a high-affinity transporter needed for PC synthesis via the PC synthase (PCS) pathway. However, the synthesis of PC was restored when the mutant was incubated in media with higher choline concentrations, suggesting the presence of an alternative low-affinity choline uptake activity. By means of a fluorescence-based equilibrium-binding assay and using the kinetics of radiolabeled choline uptake, we show that ChoX binds choline with an extremely high affinity, and we also demonstrate that its activity is inhibited by increasing choline concentrations. Cell infection assays indicate that ChoX activity is required during the first phase of B. abortus intracellular traffic, suggesting that choline concentrations in the early and intermediate Brucella-containing vacuoles are limited. Altogether, these results suggest that choline transport and PC synthesis are strictly regulated in B. abortus.",0
"Bacterial cellulose (BC) has been extensively explored as some of the most promising biomaterials for biomedical applications due to their unique properties, such as high crystallinity, high mechanical strength, ultrafine fiber network structure, good water holding capacity and biocompatibility. However, BC is lack of anti-bacterial activity which is the main issue to be solved. In the study, BC-Ag nanocomposites were prepared in situ by introducing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into BC acting as the templates. The BC and as-prepared BC-Ag nanocomposites were characterized by several techniques including scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectra, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analyses. These results indicate AgNPs successfully impregnated into BC. The releases of Ag+ at different pH values were studied, which showed pH-responsive release behaviors of BC-Ag nanocomposites. The anti-bacterial performances of BC-Ag nanocomposites were evaluated with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 9372 and Candida albicans CMCC(F) 98001, which frequently causes medical associated infections. The experimental results showed BC-Ag nanocomposites have excellent anti-bacterial activities, thus confirming its utility as potential wound dressings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Adhatoda vasica (L.) (Acanthaceae) is used in the indigenous system of medicine in India. The alkaloid Vasicine was isolated from ethanolic extract of the leaves of A. vasica using column chromatography. Vasicine acetate was obtained by acetylation of Vasicine. Vasicine acetate exhibited good zone of inhibition against bacteria: 10 mm against E. aerogenes, 10 mm against S. epidermidis, and 10 mm against P. aeruginosa. Vasicine acetate showed minimum inhibitory concentration values against bacteria: M. luteus (125 mu g/mL), E. aerogenes (125 mu g/mL), S. epidermidis (125 mu g/mL), and P. aeruginosa (125 mu g/mL). The radical scavenging activity of Vasicine acetate was the maximum at 1000 mu g/mL (66.15%). The compound showed prominent cytotoxic activity in vitro against A549 lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line. Quantification of Vasicine and Vasicine acetate by HPLC-DAD analysis showed their contents to be 0.2293% and 0.0156%, respectively, on dry weight basis of the leaves. Vasicine acetate could be probed further in drug discovery programme.",0
"Crude oil and petroleum products have a wide variety of hazardous components with high toxicity and low biodegradability. Certain dyes change their colors by intercepting electron transfer reactions during the transformation processes. This study applied resazurin and 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol indicators for a rapid screening biodegradation capability and toxicity response to various petroleum products such as motor oil, diesel, gasoline, and phenol. Colorimetry tests were performed in test tubes, and the absorbance values were measured over time. We observed different discoloration profiles after degradation tests using Bacillus subtilis inoculum. Phytotoxicity assays were also performed to compare colorimetric screening assays with a conventional toxicity testing with plants (seed germination). The results indicated that biotransformation of oils can increase its overall toxicity. Intermediate byproducts can be formed through biodegradation and thereby increase the toxicity of oils. The assessment of acute toxicity has shown that phenol is extremely toxic to petroleum-biodegrading microbial communities. Low molecular-weight gasoline was considered biodegradable, but it also exhibited a high acute toxic effect, mainly due to its high solubility and the presence of more volatile compounds that can penetrate cells and potentially damage cellular structures.",0
"The development of antimicrobial peptides as new class of antibiotic agents requires structural characterisation and understanding of their diverse mechanisms of action. As the cyclic hexapeptide cWFW(cyclo(RRRWFW)) does not exert its rapid cell killing activity by membrane permeabilisation, in this study we investigated alternative mechanisms of action, such as peptide translocation into the cytoplasm and peptide interaction with components of the phospholipid matrix of the bacterial membrane. Using fluorescence microscopy and an HPLC-based strategy to analyse peptide uptake into the cells we could confirm the cytoplasmic membrane as the major peptide target. However, unexpectedly we observed accumulation of cWFW at distinct sites of the membrane. Further characterisation of peptide-membrane interaction involved live cell imaging to visualise the distribution of the lipid cardiolipin (CL) and isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the binding affinity to model membranes with different bacterial lipid compositions. Our results demonstrate a distribution of the cyclic peptide similar to that of cardiolipin within the membrane and highly preferred affinity of cWFW for CL-rich phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) matrices. These observations point to a novel mechanism of antimicrobial killing for the cyclic hexapeptide cWFW which is neither based on membrane permeabilisation nor translocation into the cytoplasm but rather on preferred partitioning into particular lipid domains. As the phospholipids POPE/CL play a key role in the dynamic organisation of bacterial membranes we discuss the consequences of this peptide-lipid-interaction and outline the impact on antimicrobial peptide research.",0
"The cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans effectively utilizes dietary sucrose for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide, which act as a scaffold for its biofilm, thus contributing to its pathogenicity, environmental stress tolerance, and antimicrobial resistance. The two component system VicRK of S. mutans regulates a group of virulence genes that are associated with biofilm matrix synthesis. Knockout of vicX affects biofilm formation, oxidative stress tolerance, and transformation of S. mutans. However, little is known regarding the vicX-modulated structural characteristics of the exopolysaccharides underlying the biofilm formation and the phenotypes of the vicX mutants. Here, we identified the role of vicX in the structural characteristics of the exopolysaccharide matrix and biofilm physiology. The vicX mutant (SmuvicX) biofilms seemingly exhibited ""desertification"" with architecturally impaired exopolysaccharide-enmeshed cell clusters, compared with the UA159 strain (S. mutans wild type strain). Concomitantly, SmuvicX showed a decrease in water-insoluble glucan (WIG) synthesis and in WIG/water-soluble glucan (WSG) ratio. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) showed that the WIG isolated from the SmuvicX biofilms had a much lower molecular weight compared with the UA159 strain indicating differences in polysaccharide chain lengths. A monosaccharide composition analysis demonstrated the importance of the vicX gene in the glucose metabolism. We performed metabolite profiling via H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which showed that several chemical shifts were absent in both WSG and WIG of SmuvicX biofilms compared with the UA159 strain. Thus, the modulation of structural characteristics of exopolysaccharide by vicX provides new insights into the interaction between the exopolysaccharide structure, gene functions, and cariogenicity. Our results suggest that vicX gene modulates the structural characteristics of exopolysaccharide associated with cariogenicity, which may be explored as a potential target that contributes to dental caries management. Furthermore, the methods used to purify the EPS of S. mutans biofilms and to analyze multiple aspects of its structure (GPC, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) may be useful approaches to determine the roles of other virulence genes for dental caries prevention.",0
"Influence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum IMV B-7404 strain exometabolites on phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.24) activity in winter wheat seedlings has been studied. A significant increase of PAL activity at 4-6 hours after treatment of plant roots with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum IMVB-7404 strain exometabolites and in case of leaves infection with Bipolaris sorokiniana plant pathogen has been shown. It was established that PAL activity changed along with a decrease of the infected surface area of the leaves evidenced for the induction of response in winter wheat seedlings induced by IMV B-7404 strain exometabolites. It was concluded that the studied exponents could be used as model systems in the research of phytoimmunity induction mechanisms.",0
"Bacillus atrophaeus XW2 was isolated from healthy poplar leaves and exhibited a strong inhibitory effect against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, a predominant fungus causing poplar anthracnose. The culture filtrate and bacterial lysate of XW2 were antagonistic against hyphal growth and spore germination. The average diameter of the inhibition zones of hyphal growth were 22.3 mm for the culture filtrate and 12.1 mm for the bacterial lysate. The average inhibition rates of spore germination after 24 h were 94.6 % for the culture filtrate and 88.8% for the bacterial lysate. In the presence of both culture extracts, hyphae developed vacuoles and swelling, and abnormalities were observed in 100 % of germinated spores. Lipopeptides isolated from culture filtrate and bacterial lysate had high antifungal activities against C. gloeosporioides. The average diameter of the inhibition zones were 23.2 mm for culture filtrate and 11.8 mm for bacterial lysate. Crude proteins isolated from culture filtrate and bacterial lysate also showed good inhibition qualities. The average diameters for the zones of inhibition were 22.3 mm for culture filtrate and 13.4 mm for bacterial lysate. Volatiles produced by XW2 inhibited hyphal growth of C. gloeosporioides by 60.2 % and were antagonistic against the germination of C. gloeosporioides spores after 3 days. Greenhouse studies revealed that XW2 had a 49.1 % efficacy in controlling poplar anthracnose 12 days after exposure to the pathogen. We consider that Bacillus atrophaeus XW2 is a promising natural biocontrol agent for use against C. gloeosporioides.",1
"The antibacterial activity of aqueous extract of Garcinia kola, honey and mixture of aqueous G. kola extract and honey was investigated against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using agar well diffusion method. Sensitivity pattern of these bacteria was varied and extract concentration-dependent. It was observed that the synergistic use of aqueous G. kola extract and honey mixture was more effective in inhibiting bacterial growth than the separate use of aqueous G. kola extract and honey. The susceptibility of the test bacteria to the aqueous G. kola extract and honey mixture was in descending order as follows: P. aeruginosa> E. coli> S. aureus> Salmonella> K. pneumonia> B. subtilis (>=more susceptible). Aqueous G. kola extract was most active against P. aeruginosa with zones of inhibition ranging from 16.70.21 to 18.001.00 mm and least active against B. subtilis with zone of inhibition of 0.00-6.001.00 mm. Honey at 100% concentration inhibited growth of all the test organisms except B. subtilis. Statistical analysis showed that E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa at P<0.05, exhibited significant difference in their susceptibility to the synergistic mixture and separate use of aqueous G. kola extract and honey. Synergistic use of aqueous G. kola extract and honey is therefore recommended as a better option than their separate use in the treatment of infections caused by the test bacteria.",0
"The resurgence of infectious diseases and associated issues related to antibiotic resistance has raised enormous challenges which may possibly be confronted primarily by nanotechnology routes. One key need of critical significance in this context is the development of an agent capable of inhibiting quorum sensing mediated biofilm formation in pathogenic organisms. In this work we examine the possible use of a nanocomposite, CdTe-TiO2, as an impeder of growth and biofilm. In the presence of CdTe-TiO2, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows exposed cells without the surrounding matrix. Confocal laser scanning microscopy shows spatially distributed fluorescence, a typical indication of an impeded biofilm, as opposed to the control which shows matrix-covered cells and continuous fluorescence, typical of biofilm formation. Quantitatively, the inhibition of biofilm was similar to 57%. CdTe-TiO2 also exhibits good antibacterial properties against Gram positive and Gram negative organisms by virtue of the generation of reactive oxygen species inside the cells, reflected by a ruptured appearance in the SEM analysis.",0
"Fibrinogen-related proteins play important roles in the immune responses. We have obtained a cDNA encoding a novel fibrinogen-related protein from roughskin sculpin Trachidermus fasciatus (T. fasciatus) and named it as TfFREP2. The N and C terminus of TfFREP2 contain a putative 21-amino acid signal peptide and a typical 217-amino acid fibrinogen-like domain, which is conserved in all fibrinogen-related proteins. TfFREP2 has three glycosylation sites and two potential calcium-binding sites that are possibly involved in calcium coordination. The results of tissue specific checking showed that the mRNA and protein of TfFREP2 were particularly abundant in skin and gill among all the tested tissues. TfFREP2 mRNA and protein expression changed significantly after being challenged by Vibrio anguillarum pathogen in those immune-barrier tissues, such as skin and gill. Furthermore, recombinant TfFREP2 is able to agglutinate and bind V anguillarum in the presence of calcium ion. The above results suggest that TfFREP2 might be involved in the host defense of fish against V. anguillarum infection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Two novel homologous peptides named ToHyp1 and ToHyp2 that show no similarity to any known proteins were isolated from Taraxacum officinale Wigg. flowers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. Amino acid and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the peptides have unusual structure: they are cysteine-free, proline-hydroxyproline-rich and post-translationally glycosylated by pentoses, with 5 carbohydrates in ToHyp2 and 10 in ToHyp1. The ToHyp2 peptide with a monoisotopic molecular mass of 4350.3 Da was completely sequenced by a combination of Edman degradation and de novo sequencing via top down multistage collision induced dissociation (CID) and higher energy dissociation (HCD) tandem mass spectrometry (MSn). ToHyp2 consists of 35 amino acids, contains eighteen proline residues, of which 8 prolines are hydroxylated. The peptide displays antifungal activity and inhibits growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We further showed that carbohydrate moieties have no significant impact on the peptide structure, but are important for antifungal activity although not absolutely necessary. The deglycosylated ToHyp2 peptide was less active against the susceptible fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana than the native peptide. Unique structural features of the ToHyp2 peptide place it into a new family of plant defense peptides. The discovery of ToHyp peptides in T. officinale flowers expands the repertoire of molecules of plant origin with practical applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Endophytic Bacillus subtilis Y10 isolated from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) can control effectively cruciferous vegetable clubroot disease. To understand its clubroot-control mechanisms, GFP plasmids were transformed into Y10 cells for fluorescence-tagging by natural transformation. The plasmid stability, growth curve and plate antagonism bio-assay of GFP-tagged strains were determined, and the results showed only plasmid pHT01-P43GFPmut3a could be maintained stably and its introduction had no significant negative influence on Y10 growth and antagonistic performance. Pot bio-assay experiment with different cultivation matrixes indicated that there was no significant difference in clubroot-control efficiency between Y10-P43GFPmut3a and its wild type. Recovery and observation by confocal laser scanning microscope confirmed that, 9 days after inoculation, tagged strain could colonize the root, stem and leaf of Chinese cabbage, and the colonization density still kept at 10(3)-10(4) cfu . g(-1) tissues in 44 days after inoculation. All the results suggest that the clubroot-control of Y10 be intimately associated with efficient colonization in Chinese cabbage host.",0

"Biosurfactants are amphipathic, surface-active molecules of microbial origin which accumulate at interfaces reducing interfacial tension and leading to the formation of aggregated micellular structures in solution. Some biosurfactants have been reported to have antimicrobial properties, the ability to prevent adhesion and to disrupt biofilm formation. We investigated antimicrobial properties and biofilm disruption using sophorolipids at different concentrations. Growth of Gram negative Cupriavidus necator ATCC 17699 and Gram positive Bacillus subtilis BBK006 were inhibited by sophorolipids at concentrations of 5% v/v with a bactericidal effect. Sophorolipids ( 5% v/v) were also able to disrupt biofilms formed by single and mixed cultures of B. subtilis BBK006 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144 under static and flow conditions, as was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that sophorolipids may be promising compounds for use in biomedical application as adjuvants to other antimicrobial against some pathogens through inhibition of growth and/or biofilm disruption.",0
"Staphylococcus aureus is an important human and animal pathogen that causes a wide range of infections. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant S. aureus strains in both hospital and community settings makes it imperative to characterize new drug targets to combat S. aureus infections. In this context, enzymes involved in NAD metabolism and synthesis are significant drug targets as NAD is a central player in several cellular processes. NAD synthetase catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, making it a crucial intermediate enzyme linked to the biosynthesis of several amino acids, purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, coenzymes and antibiotics.",0
"Heteroscorpine-1 (HS-1) was identified as a member of the scorpine family. HS-1 shows insecticidal activities, exhibiting a low median lethal dose (LD50) in mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.) and inhibitory activities against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, a recombinant HS-1 (rHS-1) was produced by overexpression in E. coli. A large yield of product was obtained. The structure of purified rHS-1 was confirmed through mass spectrometry. Both anti-crude venom and anti-rHS-1 antibodies specifically recognized rHS-1, suggesting its structural similarity. Reactivated rHS-1 caused roughening and blebbing of bacterial cell surfaces. It showed higher activity than that of pre-refolded protein. Antisera raised against a partially purified and mis- or unfolded peptide can inhibit relevant bioactivity.",0
"A new series of N-[5-(4-(alkyl/aryl)-3-nitro-phenyl)-[1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethy l-propionamide 4 (a-1) and 6-(4-Methoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-alkyl/aryl)-3-nitro-phenyl)-Imidazo [2,1-b] [1,3,4] thiadiazole 6 (a-1) were synthesized starting from 5-(4-Fluoro-3-nitro-phenyl)-[1,3,4] thiadiazole-2-ylamine. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. All the compounds were tested for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by well plate method (zone of inhibition). Compounds 4a, 4c and 6e, 6g displayed appreciable activity at the concentration 0.5-1.0 mg/mL.

"Bacteria associated with Fucus vesiculosus and Delesseria sanguinea, two macroalgae from the Kiel Fjord were investigated seasonally over two years by cultivation-based methods. A total of 166 bacterial strains were isolated from the macroalgae, affiliated to seven classes of bacteria (Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Cytophagia and Flavobacteria). According to 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities they were arranged in 82 phylotypes of>99.0% sequence identity. Assuming that chemical factors rule the bacteriamacroalga and bacteriabacteria interactions on algal surfaces, we tested the antibiotic activity of the bacterial isolates not only against a panel of four standard test organisms (Bacillus subtilis, Candida glabrata, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus lentus) but also four macroalga-associated microorganisms: Algicola bacteriolytica and Pseudoalteromonas elyakovii (macroalgal pathogens), and Bacillus algicola and Formosa algae (strains associated with algal surfaces). Organic extracts of more than 51% of the isolates from the two macroalgae inhibited the growth of at least one of the tested microorganisms. As much as 46% and 45% of the isolates derived from F. vesiculosus and D. sanguinea, respectively, showed antimicrobial activity against the set of macroalga-associated bacteria, compared with 13 and 19% against a standard set of microorganisms. High antibacterial activity against macroalgal pathogens and bacterial competitors support the assumption that complex chemical interactions shape the relationships of bacteria associated with macroalgae and suggest that these bacteria are a rich source of antimicrobial metabolites.",0
"Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is based on the utilization of a photosensitizer with light source and oxygen, producing reactive oxygen species which inactivate microbes and fungi. In this study, the antimicrobial effect of PDI using chlorin e6 (Ce6) and halogen light was investigated against several microbes and fungus with different properties. The PDI effects were tested against two gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus and B. subtilis, and one gram-negative bacterium E. coli. The acne-causing P. acnes, opportunistic oral and genital pathogen C. albicans and main contributor to tooth decay of S. mutans were also used for PDI test. Notably, Ce6-mediated PDI showed superior in vitro anti-pathogenic effects on P. acnes, S. mutans, and C. albicans in this study.",0
"beta-Lactams are one of the most useful classes of antibiotics against many common bacterial pathogens. One exception is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, with increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and a need for new agents to treat it, the use of beta-lactams, specifically the combination of carbapenem and clavulanate, is now being revisited. With this attention, comes the need to better understand both the mechanisms of action of beta-lactams against M. tuberculosis as well as possible mechanisms of resistance, within the context of what is known about the beta-lactam action in other bacteria. M. tuberculosis has two major mechanisms of intrinsic resistance: a highly active beta-lactamase and a poorly permeable outer membrane. Within the cell wall, beta-lactams bind several enzymes with differing peptidoglycan-synthetic and -lytic functions. The inhibition of these enzymes may lead to cell death through several mechanisms, involving disruption of the balance of synthetic and lethal activities. Currently, all known means of resistance to the beta-lactams rely on diminishing the proportion of peptidoglycan-synthetic proteins bound and inhibited by beta-lactams, through either exclusion or destruction of the antibiotic, or through replacement or supplementation of target enzymes. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms for beta-lactam activity in M. tuberculosis and the means by which it may acquire resistance, within the context of what is known in other bacterial species.",0
"Contamination of plants and seeds with microorganisms is one of the main problems in the production and distribution of various agricultural products, as well as raw herbal material for the preparation of herbal remedies. In targeting microbial contamination, among other bacteria, Bacillus species showed a significant capacity for biocontrol. The antifungal activity of 14 isolates of Bacillus spp. against 15 fungal isolates from medicinal plants was examined utilizing a dual plate assay. The strongest and broadest antagonistic activity against all fungi tested was exhibited by isolates SS-12.6 and SS-13.1 (from a 43% to 74% reduction in fungal growth), while isolates SS-39.1 and SS-39.3 were effective against the fewest fungus species and also had the weakest antifungal activity. The effect of a crude lipopeptide extract (CLE) of Bacillus sp. SS-12.6 was similar to that achieved by a dual culture with isolate SS-12.6, confirming that the antagonism was the result of the antifungal activities of lipopeptides. In addition, essential oils of thyme (0.55 mg/mL) and savory (0.32 mg/mL) in various combinations with the CLE of SS-12.6 were tested for antifungal activity, and additive and synergistic effects for some of the fungi were obtained. When testing the effect of CLE, oils (0.40 mg/mL for thyme oil and 0.21 mg/mL for savory oil) and combinations in situ on marigold seeds, a reduction of total fungal infection without an adverse effect on germination was accomplished by 6-h treatments with CLE of SS-12.6 (85% reduction of fungal infection and 63% germination), supernatant from liquid culture of SS-12.6 (more than 90% reduction of fungal infection with 69% seed germination) and combinations of CLE and savory oil (77% reduction of fungal infection and 62% seed germination) and CLE with thyme and savory oils (about 75% reduction of fungal infection with 69% seed germination).

"The aim of this study was to determine whether multiple use cellulosic medical textiles (cotton blends, Tencel(A (R))) could provide protection against contamination after sterilization, regardless of the barrier system of only qualified materials, as per EN 868-2, used in the process. New methods for testing permeability and durability of the microbial barrier cellulosic textiles were developed. The most resistant endospores of two apathogenic bacteria of the Bacilllus genus (Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus) were used. Testing was conducted after 1, 10, 20, 30 and 50 washing and sterilization cycles under real hospital conditions of the University Hospital Centre Zagreb. The retention period of the microbial barrier of the diagonally packaged packages (one layer; EN ISO 11607-1:2009) after sterilization was tested after the time period of 1, 2 and 3 months of storage under controlled conditions. Bacterial permeability occurred in cellulosic medical textiles when they were contaminated with an extremely high quantity of aerobe bacterial spores. During the testing of microbial barrier durability, the package remained uncontaminated after 1, 2 and 3 months of storage. Medical cellulose textiles used under real hospital conditions functioned properly as a microbial barrier system after 50 cycles of washing and sterilization and 3 months of storage, as the sterilized content was not contaminated at all; they could be used as a microbe barrier system for packing in sterilization, regardless of the fact that they did not meet the standard EN 868-02:2009 Packaging materials for terminally sterilized medical devices. Part 2: sterilization wrap-requirements and test methods or the International standard, for example EN ISO 11607-1:2009 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices, part 1: requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging systems.",0
"Novel series of 3-O-arylalkylbenzamide and 3-O-arylalkyl-2,6-difluorobenzamide derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their on-target activity and antibacterial activity. The results indicated that the 3-O-arylalkyl-2,6-difluorobenzamide derivatives possessed much better on-target activity and antibacterial activity than the 3-O-arylalkylbenzamide derivatives. Among them, 3-O-chlorobenzyl derivative 36 was the most effective in antibacterial activity (0.5, 4, and 8 mu g/mL) against Bacillus subtilis ATCC9372, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, and penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus PR, while 3-O-methylbenzyl derivative 41 only exhibited the most potent activity (2 mu g/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923.",0
"Lysozymes are important proteins to bivalve in the innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and provide nutrition as digestion enzymes. A new LYZ1 from the freshwater mussel Cristaria plicata was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and nested PCR method. The full-length cDNA sequence of CpLYZ1 was 763 bp. The cDNA contained a 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 21 bp, a 3'-terminal UTR of 259 bp with a 29 bp poly(A) tail, a tailing signal (AATAAA) and the open reading frame of 483 bp. The CpLYZ1 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 160 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 17.8 IcDa, and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.07. The comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences with LYZs from other species showed that the enzyme belonged to i-type lysozyme. The mRNA transcript of CpLYZ1 could be detected in all the examined tissues with the highest expression level in hepatopancreas. The expression levels of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes, hepatopancreas and gill significantly increased after Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. The expression level of CpLYZ1 in hemocytes sharply decreased from 6 h to 24 h and significantly increased at 48 h, and was the highest level in hepatopancreas at 24 h, and was the maximum level in gill at 48 h. Furthermore, the recombinant CpLYZ1 was induced to be expressed as an inclusion body form by IPTG at 37 degrees C for 4 h, and then was purified by using the Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The relative enzyme activity of the recombinant CpLYZ1 was influenced on pH and temperature. The optimal pH and temperature was 5.5 and 50 degrees C, respectively. Against Escherichia coli, A. hydrophila, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus sp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the recombinant CpLYZ1 had bacteriolytic activity.

"Many bacteria take up DNA from their environment as part of the process of natural transformation. DNA uptake allows microorganisms to gain genetic diversity and can lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance or virulence genes within a microbial population. Development of genetic competence (Com) in Bacillus subtilis is a highly regulated process that culminates in expression of several late competence genes and formation of the DNA uptake apparatus. The late competence operon comF encodes a small protein of unknown function, ComFB. To gain insight into the function of ComFB, we determined its 3D structure via X-ray crystallography. ComFB is a dimer and each subunit consists of four a-helices connected by short loops and one extended beta-strand-like stretch. Each subunit contains one zinc-binding site formed by four cysteines, which are unusually spaced in the primary sequence. Using structure- and bioinformatics-guided substitutions we analyzed the inter-subunit interface of the ComFB dimer. Based on these analyses, we conclude that ComFB is an obligate dimer. We also characterized ComFB in vivo and found that this protein is produced in competent cells and is localized to the cytosol. Consistent with previous reports, we showed that deletion of ComFB does not affect DNA uptake function. Combining our results, we conclude that ComFB is unlikely to be a part of the DNA uptake machinery under tested conditions and instead may have a regulatory function.",0
"Bacterial infections associated withmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a major economic burden to hospitals, and confer high rates of morbidity and mortality among those infected. Exploitation of novel therapeutic targets is thus necessary to combat this dangerous pathogen. Here, we report on the identification and characterization, including crystal structures, of two nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors that function as anti-microbials against MRSA. These data provide the first evidence that bacterial NOS (bNOS) inhibitors can work synergistically with oxidative stress to enhance MRSA killing. Crystal structures show that each inhibitor contacts an active site Ile residue in bNOS that is Val in the mammalian NOS isoforms. Mutagenesis studies show that the additional nonpolar contacts provided by the Ile in bNOS contribute to tighter binding toward the bacterial enzyme.",0
"Five laboratory-isolated Bacillus subtilis strains: CB1, CGB, JHB1, SSB1 and WW4; and five commercial biocontrol agents: Actinovate (R) (Stretomyces lydicus strain WYEC108), Serenade (R) MAX (Bacillus subtilis strain QST713), Mycostop (R) (Streptomyces griseoviridis strain K61), RootShield (R) (Trichoderma harzianum strain T-22), and Prestop (R) WP (Gliocladium catenulatum strain J1446) were evaluated for their potential to inhibit Fusarium foetens both in vitro in Petri dishes and in the greenhouse using potted begonia plants. Bacillus subtilis strain JHB1 inhibited F. foetens mycelial growth by 76% compared with the untreated dishes after seven days of dual culturing; and also provided significant protection to potted begonia plants against F. foetens under greenhouse conditions (two trials) when applied as two soil drenches prior to pathogen inoculation. Compared with the pathogen-inoculated control, disease severity (DS) was reduced by 33% and 50% by JHB1 in trial one and two, respectively. All of the commercial biocontrol agents significantly reduced DS compared with the control when applied as soil drenches prior to pathogen inoculation. Most of the commercial products delayed plant disease symptom development by seven or more days. Moreover, Mycostop, Prestop, Actinovate, RootShield and Serenade all significantly reduced the DS, and increased the shoot dry weights and chlorophyll content index for over 28 days after inoculation compared with the control.",0
"NK-lysin is an effector protein of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Mammalian NK-lysin is known to possess antibacterial property and antitumor activity. Homologues of NK-lysin have been identified in several teleost species, but the natural function of fish NK-lysin remains essentially unknown. In this study, we identified a NK-lysin, CsNKL1, from half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) and analyzed its expression, genetic organization, and biological effect on pathogen infection. CsNKL1 is composed of 135 residues and shares 33.1-56.5% overall sequence identities with other teleost NK-lysin. CsNKL1 possesses a Saposin B domain and six conserved cysteine residues that in mammals are known to form three intrachain disulfide bonds essential to antimicrobial activity. The genomic sequence of the ORF region of CsNKL1 is 1240 bp in length and, like human NK-lysin, contains five exons and four introns. Expression of CsNKL1 occurred in multiple tissues and was upregulated by bacterial and viral infection in a time dependent manner. When CsNKL1 was overexpressed in tongue sole, significant upregulation of interleukin-1 and chemokines was observed in spleen and head kidney. Following bacterial and viral infection, the pathogen loads in the tissues of CsNKL1-overexpressing fish were significantly lower than those in control fish. These results indicate that CsNKL1 possesses the novel capacities of immunomodulation and enhancing antimicrobial defense against pathogens of both bacterial and viral nature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"In this study, the regulatory mechanism of the ula (utilization of L-ascorbic acid) operon, putatively responsible for transport and utilization of ascorbic acid in Streptococcus pneumoniae strain D39, is studied. beta-Galactosidase assay data demonstrate that expression of the ula operon is increased in the presence of ascorbic acid as compared with the effects of other sugar sources including glucose. The ula operon consists of nine genes, including a transcriptional regulator UlaR, and is transcribed as a single transcriptional unit. We demonstrate the role of the transcriptional regulator UlaR as a transcriptional activator of the ula operon in the presence of ascorbic acid and show that activation of the ula operon genes by UlaR is CcpA-independent. Furthermore, we predict a 16 bp regulatory site (5'-AACAGTCCGCTGTGTA-3') for UlaR in the promoter region of ulaA. Deletion of the half or full UlaR regulatory site in PulaA confirmed that the UlaR regulatory site present in PulaA is functional.",0
"The impact of inoculation with the biocontrol agent Bacillus subtilis on bacterial communities and bacterial diversity in rhizospheric soil of Nicotiana tabacum was assessed by constructing a 16S rRNA gene clone library and conducting amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The bacterial diversity was evaluated by coverage value ( C), Shannon index ( H), Pielou evenness index (E) and Margalef richness index ( R). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the inoculation significantly affected the composition of bacterial communities in tobacco rhizospheric soil. A total of twelve bacterial groups including Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria ( including alpha-, beta-, delta-, gamma-Proteobacteria), Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Gemmatimonadetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes were detected to be shared by inoculated soil and control soil. The community composition and proportions of different bacteria in the communities showed significant variations between the two samples. The dominant bacteria were Acidobacteria (27.1%) and Proteobacteria (26.5%) in control soil, while in the inoculated soil Proteobacteria (38.0%) and Acidobacteria (29. 6%) were dominant. B. subtilis inoculation increased the numbers of y-Proteobacteria and alpha-Proteobacteria but reduced the numbers of bacterial groups such as beta-Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Firrnicutes. Diversity analysis showed that bacterial diversity was rich for both soil samples, and soil bacterial Shannon index and Margalef richness index were promoted after inoculation.",0
"Wild marigold (Tagetes minuta), a flowering plant of the family Asteraceae contains compounds of pharmaceutical and nutritional importance especially essential oils and flavonols. Identification, characterization of flavonols and determination of their antibacterial activity were major objectives of the current study. The isolation and purification of flavonols was accomplished using chromatographic techniques while structural elucidation was completed by LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. The extracts and purified compounds were tested against various bacterial strains for antibacterial activity. A total of 19 flavonols were isolated from this species. Of these, 17 were of butanol and two of ethyl acetate extracts. Based on the concentration and purity, eight potential flavonols were selected and structurally elucidated. Four flavonols, 6-hydroxyquercetin 7-O-beta-(6 ''-galloylglucopyranoside; 2), 6-hydroxykaempferol 7-O-beta-glucopyranoside (5), 6-hydroxykaempferol 7-O-beta-(6 ''-galloylglucopyranoside; 7), 6 hydroxyquercetin 7-O-beta-(6 ''-caffeoylglucopyranoside; 9), were identified for the first time from T. minuta. Butanol and ethyl acetate extracts of flowers and seeds showed significant antibacterial activity against Micrococcus leteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas pikettii. Among the isolated flavonols only 1, 2, and 18 were found to possess significant antibacterial activity against M. luteus. The extracts and purified flavonols from T minuta can be potential candidates for antibacterial drug discovery and support to ethnopharmacological use.",0
"The antibacterial potential of an endangered medicinal plant Tylophora indica was analyzed by agar well diffusion method and its activity was compared with that of its in vitro raised plant and callus. The extracts of parent plant of T. indica showed good antibacterial activity against gram negative bacteria only; whereas, the extracts from in vitro raised plant and leaf callus showed good activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the alcoholic leaf extract of in vitro raised plant was determined by broth microdilution method. MIC against gram positive bacteria ranged from 3.05 to 12.0 g/ml and MIC against gram negative bacteria ranged from 1.53 to 24.0 g/ml. The present study leads to conclusion that extracts of T. indica contains good antibacterial activity which can be used in the treatment of various infections showing resistance to treatment by currently used antimicrobial agents. As the in vitro raised plant and callus gave better results as compared to parent plant, in vitro cultivation of explants may be used to obtain novel antibacterial compounds. This is the first report on antibacterial activity of T. indica through in vitro raised plant and its callus.",0
"[Objective] We isolated 339 bacillus strains from 72 soil samples all over the country, then purified their antimicrobial compounds and studied the antibacterial activity, to enrich bacillus resources and explore their second metabolites. [Methods] A bacillus strain with strong antibacterial activity was selected by dilution plate and water bath heating from a soil sample from a peanut plantation in Henan Province; this strain was identified according to morphological observation, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and consequences of 16S rRNA homologous analysis. Antibacterial compound from the identified strain, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens X030, was separated and purified by acetone precipitation, Sephadex chromatography, C-18 reverse phase column chromatography. Its molecular weight was analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The antibacterial activity was characterized by disc diffusion and plate two-way cultivation. [Results] Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was isolated that not only has antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albican and Saccharomycetes; but also against Pyriculariaoryzae, Chili pointed cell anthrax, Gloeosporium eriobotryae speg and Phytophthora parasitica. The compound was confirmed as polypeptide. [Conclusion] Bacillus amyloliquefaciens X030 can produce a polypeptide that inhibits pathogenic bacteria and plant pathogenic fungi.",1
"Aim: To examine the antimicrobial properties of various spices commonly used in Indian cuisine and to check if the resistance in bacteria is plasmid borne. Study Design: To demonstrate the antimicrobial properties in various household spices like Cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), Clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), Black Pepper ( Piper nigram) and Turmeric ( Curcuma longa) and to examine their effects on the pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Microbiology, Osmania University, India during June 2013-January 2014. Methodology: Antimicrobial assay was performed to determine the antimicrobial activity of these spices. Plasmids were isolated from bacteria showing resistance to these spices to confirm if the resistance to these spices was plasmid borne. The isolated plasmids were used to transform E. coli DH5alpha which was previously observed to be sensitive to these spices. Results: On transformation with plasmids isolated from K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, E. coli DH5alpha cells were observed to gain resistance to all the four spices tested in the original strains of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: The resistance to spices seems to be a plasmid borne feature which may be transferred to sensitive bacterial strains.",0
"New octyl/dodecyl 2,6-dideoxy-D-arabino-hexopyranosides have been synthesized by a simple but efficient methodology based on the reaction of glycals with alcohols catalysed by triphenylphosphane hydrobromide, deprotection, regioselective tosylation and reduction. Their surface-active properties were evaluated in terms of adsorption and aggregation parameters and compared with those of 2-deoxy-D-glycosides and 2,6-dideoxy-L-glycosides. Deoxygenation at the 6-position led to a decrease in the critical micelle concentration, and an increase in the adsorption efficiency (pC(20)) promoting aggregation more efficiently than adsorption. With regard to the antibacterial activity, dodecyl 2,6-dideoxy-alpha-L-arabinohexopyranoside was the most active compound towards Bacillus anthracis (MIC 25 mu M), whereas its enantiomer exhibited a MIC value of 50 mu M. Both 2,6-dideoxy glycosides were active towards Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes. In contrast, none of the 2-deoxy glycosides was significantly active. These results and the data on surface activity suggest that aggregation is a key issue for antimicrobial activity. Beyond infection, Alzheimer's disease also threatens elderly populations. In the search for butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) selective inhibition, 2-deoxy glycosides were screened in vitro by using Ellman's assay. Octyl 2-deoxy-alpha-D-glycoside was found to be a BChE selective inhibitor promoting competitive inhibition. Docking studies supported these results as they pinpoint the importance of the primary OH group in stabilizing the BChE inhibitor complex. A size-exclusion mechanism for inhibition has been proposed based on the fact that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) exhibits several bulky residues that hinder access to the active-site cavity. This work shows how the deoxygenation pattern, configuration and functionality of the anomeric centre can tune physical and surface properties as well as the bioactivity of these multifunctional and stereochemically rich molecules.",0
"In the present study, some novel fluorine-containing heterocycles incorporating benzofuran with dihydropyrazoles and dihydroisoxazoles have been synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities. 2-Acetylbenzofuran on treatment with fluorinated aldehydes afforded corresponding fluorine-containing 1-benzofuran-2-yl-3-phenyl-prop-2-en-1-ones (chalcones 5a-g). The cyclocondensation of chalcones (5a-g) with hydrazine hydrate under basic conditions resulted in formation of corresponding novel fluorine-containing 3-benzofuran-2yl-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles (6a-g). Similar reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride yielded 3-benzofuran-2yl-5-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-isoxazoles (7a-g). All the synthesized compounds have been characterized on the basis of analytical and spectral data, and were screened for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Some of the synthesized compounds showed good antibacterial and antifungal activities.",0
"Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a rising public health threat and make the identification of new antibiotics a priority. From a cell-based screen for bactericidal compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis under nutrient-deprivation conditions we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable FDA-approved antirheumatic drug, as having potent bactericidal activities against both replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. We also found that auranofin is active against other Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecalis, and drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. Our biochemical studies showed that auranofin inhibits the bacterial thioredoxin reductase, a protein essential in many Gram-positive bacteria for maintaining the thiol-redox balance and protecting against reactive oxidative species. Auranofin decreases the reducing capacity of target bacteria, thereby sensitizing them to oxidative stress. Finally, auranofin was efficacious in a murine model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection. These results suggest that the thioredoxin-mediated redox cascade of Gram-positive pathogens is a valid target for the development of antibacterial drugs, and that the existing clinical agent auranofin may be repurposed to aid in the treatment of several important antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",0
"Endophytic microorganisms consist of fungi, bacteria, and actinomycetes that play important roles in the process of plant adaptation to the environment. Currently, the natural associations between microorganisms and plant species are being explored for a large number of biotechnological applications. In this study, 122 endophytic bacteria were isolated from 5 cultivars of Musa spp from the state of Amazonas (Brazil). Four strains were selected because they exhibited antagonistic activities against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp cubense and Colletotrichum guaranicola, with inhibitions ranging from 19 to 30% and 27 to 35%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA regions of these bacteria with antifungal activity showed that they are phylogenetically related to 3 different species of Bacillus - B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis subsp subtilis, and B. thuringiensis.",0
"To obtain host iron, Staphylococcus aureus secretes siderophores staphyloferrin A (SA) or staphyloferrin B (SB), and accesses heme iron through use of iron-regulated surface determinant proteins. While iron transport in S. aureus is well documented, there is scant information about proteins required to access iron from complexes in the cytoplasm. In vitro studies identified a pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase, named IruO, as an electron donor for the heme monooxygenases IsdG and IsdI, promoting heme degradation. Here, we show that an iruO mutant was not debilitated for growth on heme, suggesting involvement of another reductase. NtrA is an iron-regulated nitroreductase and, as with the iruO mutant, a ntrA mutant grew on heme comparable with wild type (WT). In contrast, a iruOntrA double mutant was severely debilitated for growth on heme, a phenotype that was complemented by expression of either iruO or ntrAin trans, demonstrating their overlapping role in heme-iron utilization. Contrasting the involvement of multiple reductases for heme iron utilization, ntrA was shown essential for iron utilization using SA, although not SB or other siderophores tested, and an iruO mutant was incapable of deferoxamine-mediated growth. Accordingly, virulence of WT S. aureus, but not an iruO mutant, was enhanced in mice receiving deferoxamine.",0
"A new ophiobolin derivative, 3-anhydro-6-hydroxy-ophiobolin A (1), as well as two known ophiobolin derivatives 3-anhydro-ophiobolin A (2) and 3-anhydro-6-epi-ophiobolin A (3) were isolated from the PDB culture of a phytopathogenic fungus Bipolaris oryzae. The structure of 1 was elucidated through 2D NMR and other spectroscopic techniques. Compound 1 exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Bacille Calmette-Guerin, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with MIC value of 12.5 mu g/mL, and potent antiproliferative activity against cell lines HepG2 and K562 with IC50 of 6.49 mu M and 4.06 mu M, respectively. Further studies on the cytotoxicity of compound 1 against K562 cells demonstrated that it induced apoptosis, observed by flow cytometric method. Preliminary structure-activity relationships of these ophiobolins and the mechanism of apoptosis induced by 1 were analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"In 2008 and 2009, severe fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) occurred in Illinois apple orchards, leading to speculation that streptomycin-resistant strains of E. amylovora might be present in some orchards. Statewide surveys were conducted in 2010, 2011, and 2012, and 117, 129, and 170, E. amylovora isolates were collected, respectively, from 20 counties. None of the 416 E. amylovora isolates tested were resistant to streptomycin (Agri-Mycin 17WP) at 50 mg/liter. Seven non-E. amylovora bacterial isolates were collected from E. amylovora-infected shoots that contained both a strA-strB streptomycin resistance gene and IS1133 on transposon Tn5393, which could be a potential source of streptomycin resistance for E. amylovora in Illinois in the future. Colony development of all 84 E. amylovora isolates tested was inhibited on Luria-Bertani medium amended with oxytetracycline at 50 mg/liter and kasugamycin (Kasumin 2L) at 100 mg/liter. Similarly, colony development of the 84 E. amylovora isolates was inhibited on casitone-yeast extract medium amended with copper sulfate at 0.16 mM. In 2011 and 2012, field trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of oxytetracycline (Mycoshield 17WP), kasugamycin (Kasumin 2L and ARY-4016-06), copper hydroxide (Kocide-3000 41.6DF), Bacillus subtilis (Serenade Max, QST713), and Pseudomonas fluorescens (Blight Ban A506) for management of fire blight in an apple orchard. Only kasugamycin (Kasumin 2L and ARY-4016-06) reduced blossom infection significantly. There was a significant interaction of kasugamycin (Kasumin 2L) with prohexadione calcium (Apogee 27.5DF) in reducing shoot blight incidence in the field in 2012.",0
"Plant diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria and fungi are a severe problem for Mediterranean agriculture and some composts have shown a suppressive capacity due to the antagonistic action of microbial communities inhabiting those substrates. The purpose of this work was to isolate and identify those microorganisms from agro-industrial waste-based compost able to antagonize Xanthomonas campestris and Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. melonis, two devastating phytopathogens in the Southeast of Spain. To this end, a collection of 135 strains comprising bacteria, actinobacteria and fungi was isolated and their suppressiveness tested in vitro. Those strains with the best inhibition indexes were selected for in vivo tests. While performing in vitro assays, half of the tested strains were effective only against F. oxysporum f.sp. melonis, less than a 4% of the tested strains only antagonized X. campestris and eight strains were noticed to be antagonists against both phytopathogens. In vivo assays were performed using five strains selected because of their higher inhibition indexes and identified by molecular methods as Acetobacter indonesiensis, Bacillus pumilus, Paecilomyces variotii, Streptomyces griseus and Acremonium chrysogenum. Additional assays were carried out to check the plants health status in the absence of pathogens so as to discard possible damaged caused by those five biocontrol agents. The in vivo tests succeeded in pointing out P. variotii as a broad spectrum biocontrol agent effective against both bacterial spot of tomato and fusarium wilt of melon. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"The rise of antimicrobial resistance in human pathogenic bacteria has increased the necessity for the discovery of novel, yet unexplored antibacterial drug targets. Riboswitches, which are embedded in untranslated regions of bacterial messenger RNA (mRNA), represent such an interesting target structure. These RNA elements regulate gene expression upon binding to natural metabolites, second messengers, and inorganic ions, such as fluoride with high affinity and in a highly discriminative manner. Recently, efforts have been directed toward the identification of artificial riboswitch activators by establishing high-throughput screening assays, fragment-based screening, and structure-guided ligand design approaches. Emphasis in this review is placed on the special requirements and synthesis of new potential antibiotic drugs that target riboswitches in which dissimilarity is an important aspect in the design of potential lead compounds.",0
"Enterococcus faecalis strains are commensal bacteria in humans and other animals, and they are also the causative agent of opportunistic infectious diseases. Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced by certain E. faecalis clinical isolates, and it is active against other E. faecalis strains. Our genetic analyses demonstrated that the extracellular products of the bacL(1) and bacA genes, which are encoded in the Bac41 operon, coordinately express the bacteriocin activity against E. faecalis. In this study, we investigated the molecular functions of the BacL(1) and BacA proteins. Immunoblotting and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that BacL(1) and BacA are secreted without any processing. The coincidental treatment with the recombinant BacL(1) and BacA showed complete bacteriocin activity against E. faecalis, but neither BacL(1) nor BacA protein alone showed the bacteriocin activity. Interestingly, BacL(1) alone demonstrated substantial degrading activity against the cell wall fraction of E. faecalis in the absence of BacA. Furthermore, MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that BacL(1) has a peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase activity via a NlpC/P60 homology domain. These results collectively suggest that BacL(1) serves as a peptidoglycan hydrolase and, when BacA is present, results in the lysis of viable E. faecalis cells.",0
"The resuscitation-promoting factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are hydrolytic enzymes, which are required for resuscitation of dormant cells. RpfB, a peptidoglycan remodelling enzyme similar to the lytic transglycosylase of Escherichia coli, is required for reactivation of M. tuberculosis from chronic infection in vivo, underscoring the need to understand its transcriptional regulation. Here, we identified the transcriptional and translational start points of rpfB, and suggested from rpf promoter-driven GFP expression and in vitro transcription assays that its transcription possibly occurs in a SigB-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that rpfB transcription is regulated by MtrA the response regulator of the essential two-component system MtrAB. Association of MtrA with the rpfB promoter region in vivo was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed a loose direct repeat sequence associated with MtrA binding. Binding of MtrA was enhanced upon phosphorylation. MtrA could be pulled down from lysates of M. tuberculosis using a biotinylated DNA fragment encompassing the MtrA-binding site on the rpfB promoter, confirming that MtrA binds to the rpfB promoter. Enhanced GFP fluorescence driven by the rpfB promoter, upon deletion of the MtrA-binding site, and repression of rpfB expression, upon overexpression of MtrA, suggested that MtrA functions as a repressor of rpfB transcription. This was corroborated by EMSAs showing diminished association of RNA polymerase (RNAP) with the rpfB promoter in the presence of MtrA. In vitro transcription assays confirmed that MtrA inhibits RNAP-driven rpfB transcription.",0
"Copper based nanoparticles (Cu-based NPs) of different compositions and sizes have been hydrothermally synthesized by varying the reaction time in the presence of the biocompatible surfactants polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan laurate (Tween 20) and polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000). Effective control of the above synthetic parameters gave rise to Cu, Cu2O and Cu/Cu2O NPs of 10-44 nm. The antibacterial activity of the NPs was screened against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Xanthomonas campestris, Escherichia Coli) bacteria. The Cu-based NPs induce pDNA degradation in a dose-dependent manner as well as extensive ds CT-DNA degradation. Cu2O NPs of 16 nm and 12 nm exhibit the lowest IC50 values (2.13 mu g/mL and 3.7 mu g/mL) against B. cereus and B. subtilis, respectively. The agarose gel electrophoresis of ds CT-DNA treated with Cu2O NPs demonstrated degradation at high concentration. In lower concentrations, viscosity measurements indicated groove binding. In regard to the enhanced antibacterial effect and specificity of Cu2O NPs against the Gram-positive strains, the activity pathway was further explored and ROS production and lipid peroxidation verified. The released copper ions 5.15 mg/L in distilled water and 16.32 mg/L in nutrient medium, found below the critical value to inhibit bacterial growth and thus nanosized composition effect is predominant.

"Infectious diseases comprise some of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Interactions between pathogen and host proteins underlie the process of infection. Improved understanding of pathogen-host molecular interactions will increase our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in infection, and allow novel therapeutic solutions to be devised. Complete genome sequences for a number of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as the human host, has led to the revelation of their protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. In this post-genomic era, pathogen-host interactions (PHIs) operating during infection can also be mapped. Detailed systematic analyses of PPI and PHI data together are required for a complete understanding of pathogenesis of infections. Here we review the striking results recently obtained during the construction and investigation of these networks. Emphasis is placed on studies producing large-scale interaction data by high-throughput experimental techniques.",0
"Removal of gaseous chlorobenzene (CB) by a biotrickling filter (BTF) filled with modified ceramics and multi-surface hollow balls during gas-liquid mass transfer at the steady state was by microbial degradation rather than dissolution in the spray liquid or emission into the atmosphere. The BTF was flexible and resistant to the acid environment of the spray liquid, with the caveat that the spray liquid should be replaced once every 6-7 days. The BTF, loaded with Lysinibacillus fusiformis, performed well for purification of high-loading CB gas. The maximum CB gas inlet loading rate, 103 g m(-3) h(-1), CB elimination capacity, 97 g m(-3) h(-1), and CB removal efficiency, 97.7 %, were reached at a spray liquid flow rate of 27.6 ml min(-1), an initial CB concentration of up to 1,300 mg m(-3), and an empty bed retention time of more than 45 s.",0
"Genetic transformation, in which cells internalize exogenous DNA and integrate it into their chromosome, is widespread in the bacterial kingdom. It involves a specialized membrane-associated machinery for binding double-stranded (ds) DNA and uptake of single-stranded (ss) fragments. In the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, this machinery is specifically assembled at competence. The EndA nuclease, a constitutively expressed virulence factor, is recruited during competence to play the key role of converting dsDNA into ssDNA for uptake. Here we use fluorescence microscopy to show that EndA is uniformly distributed in the membrane of noncompetent cells and relocalizes at midcell during competence. This recruitment requires the dsDNA receptor ComEA. We also show that under 'static' binding conditions, i.e., in cells impaired for uptake, EndA and ComEA colocalize at midcell, together with fluorescent end-labelled dsDNA (Cy3-dsDNA). We conclude that midcell clustering of EndA reflects its recruitment to the DNA uptake machinery rather than its sequestration away from this machinery to protect transforming DNA from extensive degradation. In contrast, a fraction of ComEA molecules were located at cell poles post-competence, suggesting the pole as the site of degradation of the dsDNA receptor. In uptake-proficient cells, we used Cy3-dsDNA molecules enabling expression of a GFP fusion upon chromosomal integration to identify transformed cells as GFP producers 60-70 min after initial contact between DNA and competent cells. Recording of images since initial cell-DNA contact allowed us to look back to the uptake period for these transformed cells. Cy3-DNA foci were thus detected at the cell surface 10-11 min post-initial contact, all exclusively found at midcell, strongly suggesting that active uptake of transforming DNA takes place at this position in pneumococci. We discuss how midcell uptake could influence homology search, and the likelihood that midcell uptake is characteristic of cocci and/or the growth phase-dependency of competence.",0
"The spread of an infectious agent in a population can be reduced by interfering in the infectiousness or susceptibility of individuals, and/or in their contact structure. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of prevention of direct contact between infectious and susceptible pigs on the transmission of Streptococcus suis (S. suis). In three replicate experiments, S. suis-free pigs were housed in boxes either in pairs (25 pairs) or alone (15 pigs). The distance between the boxes was +/- 1 m. At 7 weeks of age, one pig of each pair was inoculated intranasally with S. suis serotype 9; the other pigs were exposed to S. suis by either direct (pairs) or indirect contact (individually housed pigs). Tonsillar brush and saliva swab samples from all pigs were collected regularly for 4 weeks post inoculation to monitor colonization with S. suis. All inoculated pigs became infected, and their pen mates became colonized within 2 days. Thirteen indirectly exposed pigs became positive within 725 days after exposure. The rate of direct transmission beta(dir) was estimated to be 3.58 per pig per day (95% CI: 2.29-5.60). The rate of indirect transmission increased in time, depending on the cumulative number of days pigs tested positive for the presence of S. suis. The estimate beta'(ind) was 0.001 (95% CI: 0.0006-0.0017) new infections per pig per day for each day that an infected pig was tested positive for S. suis. We conclude that prevention of direct contact reduces the rate at which susceptible pigs become colonized. Simulation studies using these parameters showed, however, that such intervention measure would not limit S. suis serotype 9 spread in a commercial pig farm to a relevant extent, implying that spatial separation of groups op pigs within a compartment would not be effective on a farm.",0
"The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; Ile, Leu, and Val) not only are important nutrients for the growth of Staphylococcus aureus but also are corepressors for CodY, which regulates virulence gene expression, implicating BCAAs as an important link between the metabolic state of the cell and virulence. BCAAs are either synthesized intracellularly or acquired from the environment. S. aureus encodes three putative BCAA transporters, designated BrnQ1, BrnQ2, and BrnQ3; their functions have not yet been formally tested. In this study, we mutated all three brnQ paralogs so as to characterize their substrate specificities and their roles in growth in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that in the community-associated, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CAMRSA) strain USA300, BrnQ1 is involved in uptake of all three BCAAs, BrnQ2 transports Ile, and BrnQ3 does not have a significant role in BCAA transport under the conditions tested. Of the three, only BrnQ1 is essential for USA300 to grow in a chemically defined medium that is limited for Leu or Val. Interestingly, we observed that a brnQ2 mutant grew better than USA300 in media limited for Leu and Val, owing to the fact that this mutation leads to overexpression of brnQ1. In a murine infection model, the brnQ1 mutant was attenuated, but in contrast, brnQ2 mutants had significantly increased virulence compared to that of USA300, a phenotype we suggest is at least partially linked to enhanced in vivo scavenging of Leu and Val through BrnQ1. These data uncover a hitherto-undiscovered connection between nutrient acquisition and virulence in CA-MRSA.",0
"The chromatographic investigation of the chloroform soluble fraction of methanolic root extract of Ochna schweinfurthiana using a combination of silica and sephadex LH-20 led to the isolation of tri-methoxy derivative of lophirone A. The structure of this new compound was determined using both 1 and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The antimicrobial activity of the isolated compound was also investigated using agar diffusion and broth dilution techniques. Clinical isolates obtained from the Department of Medical Microbiology, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, Nigeria were used for the studies. The compound was found to show activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyrogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Samonella typhi, but was not active at the tested dose on methicillin resistant S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Corynobacterium ulcerans, Escherichia coli and the only fungi tested Candida albicans. The low concentration for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, 5 g/ml) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC, 20 g/ml) suggests the compound has a good antimicrobial activity against the susceptible organisms and validates the ethno medicinal use of the plant in the treatment of various bacterial infections, including infected wounds and typhoid fever.",0
"Amylosin, a heat-stable channel-forming non-ribosomally synthesized peptide toxin produced by strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens isolated from moisture-damaged buildings, is shown in this paper to have immunotoxic and cytotoxic effects on human cells as well as antagonistic effects on microbes. Human macrophages exposed to 50 ng of amylosin ml(-1) secreted high levels of cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-18 within 2 h, indicating activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an integral part of the innate immune system. At the same exposure level, expression of IL-1 beta and IL-18 mRNA increased. Amylosin caused dose-dependent potassium ion efflux from all tested mammalian cells (human monocytes and keratinocytes and porcine sperm cells) at 1 to 2 mu M exposure. Amylosin also inhibited the motility of porcine sperm cells and depolarized the mitochondria of human keratinocytes. Amylosin may thus trigger the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequently cytokine release by causing potassium efflux from exposed cells. The results of this study indicate that exposure to amylosin activates the innate immune system, which could offer an explanation for the inflammatory symptoms experienced by occupants of moisture-damaged buildings. In addition, the amylosin-producing B. amyloliquefaciens inhibited the growth of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic indoor microbes, and purified amylosin also had an antimicrobial effect. These antimicrobial effects could make amylosin producers dominant and therefore significant causal agents of health problems in some moisture-damaged sites.",1
"The present study intended for the chemical synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles (IO-NPs) followed by characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity after treating with Argemone mexicana L. leaf extract. The formation of IO-NPs was confirmed by the colour change and further examined by UV-vis spectroscopy. The morphology was characterized by using SEM and TEM, which showed spherical particles of uniform size ranged between 10 and 30 nm and the crystallites were determined through XRD. The peaks in XRD pattern are in good agreement with that of face-centered cubic form of iron oxide nanoparticles. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed the attachment of bioactive molecules of plant on the IO-NPs surfaces. Furthermore, the antibacterial efficacy of IO-NPs, plant extract and IO-NPs treated with plant extract was screened against Escherichia coli MTCC 443, Proteus mirabilis MTCC 425 and Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441. The results showed a noteworthy inhibition on P. mirabilis and E. coli with IO-NPs treated plant extract. This outcome may pave a way for using the magnetic nanoparticles as a drug carrier system to cure bacterial diseases. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"In the present study, the synthesis of new bis-isatin carbohydrazone derivatives and their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were investigated. The structures of new compounds were elucidated by Fourier transform infrared, H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectra. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by using the two-fold serial dilution technique against various bacterial and fungal species in comparison to standard drugs. All synthesized compounds displayed a broad spectrum of activities with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 6.25 to 100g/ml against tested microorganisms. The in vitro antioxidant activity was evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the total antioxidant capacity by a phosphomolybdenum assay and their ability to chelate ferrous iron. In general, the derivatives were found to exhibit antioxidant activity. Further, the compounds with electron-withdrawing groups at the C5 position demonstrated significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.",0
"Cystatin 11 (CST11) belongs to the cystatin type 2 family of cysteine protease inhibitors and exhibits antimicrobial activity in vitro. In this study, we describe the expression and purification of recombinant porcine CST11 in the Pichia pastoris system. We then assess its antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis by liquid growth inhibition assay. Kinetic studies indicate that the recombinant porcine CST11 has high potency against E. coli and S. aureus. Scanning electronic microscope analysis showed that CST11 might be targeting the bacterial membrane and, thus, could potentially be developed as a therapeutic agent for inhibiting microbe infection without the risk of antibiotic resistance.",0
"Abiotic stress interferes with plant-microbial interactions, but some microorganisms may buffer this interference. We investigated the interaction between temperature and bacterial wilt (Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens - Cff) biocontrol and the ability of Bacillus subtilis strain ALB629 to colonize bean seedlings, to inhibit pathogen growth and to use different C and N sources. B. subtilis ALB629(rif), a mutant selected from the wild population of ALB629, was used to monitor plant colonization at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. ALB629(rif) was detected only in the plant roots (10(3.22) CFU g(-1)) at the lower temperature but colonized the roots, stems, and leaves (10(5.85), 10(4.48), and 10(4.01) CFU g(-1)), respectively, at 30 degrees C. The area under the disease progress curve was also different at the two tested temperatures (p < 0.01). Nevertheless, the disease reduction using ALB629(rif) - treated seeds was similar: 71% and 75%, respectively, at 20 and 30 degrees C (p < 0.01). A higher efficiency of C and N source utilization was observed at the higher temperature, but the antagonist inhibited Cff growth equally at either temperature in vitro. Based on our results, temperature interferes with pathogen and antagonist plant colonization, but the overall suppression of bacterial wilt appears to be stabilized by ALB629.",0
"Clostridium perfringens type A is a common source of foodborne illness (FBI) in humans. Vegetative cells sporulate in the small intestinal tract and produce the major pathogenic factor C. perfringens enterotoxin. Although sporulation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of FBI, the mechanisms inducing sporulation remain unclear. Bile salts were shown previously to induce sporulation, and we confirmed deoxycholate (DCA)-induced sporulation in C. perfringens strain NCTC8239 cocultured with human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells. In the present study, we performed transcriptome analyses of strain NCTC8239 in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying DCA-induced sporulation. Of the 2,761 genes analyzed, 333 were up-or downregulated during DCA-induced sporulation and included genes for cell division, nutrient metabolism, signal transduction, and defense mechanisms. In contrast, the virulence-associated transcriptional regulators (the VirR/VirS system, the agr system, codY, and abrB) were not activated by DCA. DCA markedly increased the expression of signaling molecules controlled by Spo0A, the master regulator of the sporulation process, whereas the expression of spo0A itself was not altered in the presence or absence of DCA. The phosphorylation of Spo0A was enhanced in the presence of DCA. Collectively, these results demonstrated that DCA induced sporulation, at least partially, by facilitating the phosphorylation of Spo0A and activating Spo0A-regulated genes in strain NCTC8239 while altering the expression of various genes. IMPORTANCE Disease caused by Clostridium perfringens type A consistently ranks among the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses in humans in developed countries. The sporulation of C. perfringens in the small intestinal tract is a key event for its pathogenesis, but the factors and underlying mechanisms by which C. perfringens sporulates in vivo currently remain unclear. Bile salts, major components of bile, which is secreted from the liver for the emulsification of lipids, were shown to induce sporulation. However, the mechanisms underlying bile salt-induced sporulation have not yet been clarified. In the present study, we demonstrate that deoxycholate (one of the bile salts) induces sporulation by facilitating the phosphorylation of Spo0A and activating Spo0A-regulated genes using a transcriptome analysis. Thus, this study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying sporulation, particularly that of bile salt-induced sporulation, in C. perfringens.",0
"Present investigation was aimed to isolate and study the rhizobacteria and AM fungi from rhizosphere of wild legumes: Mimosa pudica (sensitive plant), Crotolariapallida (Sunhemp), Cassiatora (Sickle pod) and Desmodium. The molecular characterization of four bacterial isolates were done. Four bacterial species Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus aerophilus, Microbacterium laevaniformans and Staphylococcus xylosus were isolated from strains M1, RT, D5 and D7 respectively. Also, the distribution of AM fungi population was studied from rhizosphere soils of these legumes. Among the AM fungi, Glomus species was dominant and bacterial genus Bacillus was found to be dominant. Maximum number of VAM infection was found in the rhizosphere soil of Mimosa pudica of Srikona.",0
"Toxicity of pesticides towards microorganisms can have a major impact on ecosystem function. Nevertheless, some microorganisms are able to respond quickly to this stress by degrading these molecules. The edaphic Bacillus megaterium strain Mes11 can degrade the herbicide mesotrione. In order to gain insight into the cellular response involved, the intracellular proteome of Mes11 exposed to mesotrione was analyzed using the two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) approach coupled with mass spectrometry. The results showed an average of 1820 protein spots being detected. The gel profile analyses revealed 32 protein spots whose abundance is modified after treatment with mesotrione. Twenty spots could be identified, leading to 17 non redundant proteins, mainly involved in stress, metabolic and storage mechanisms. These findings clarify the pathways used by B. megaterium strain Mesh 1 to resist and adapt to the presence of mesotrione. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Necrotic enteritis (NE) is an enterotoxemic disease caused by Clostridium perfringens that results in significant economic losses, averaging damage of $0.05 per bird. The present study investigated the influence of a dietary supplement, Bacillus subtilis PB6, on performance, intestinal health, and gut integrity against C. perfringens-induced NE in broiler birds. Bacillus subtilis PB6 (ATCC-PTA 6737) is a natural strain isolated from healthy chicken gut that has been shown in in vitro to produce antimicrobial substances with broad activity against various strains of Campylobacter and Clostridium species. The animal study was conducted on broiler chickens (Cobb 400) for the period of 35 d using a completely randomized design. The experimental design included 3 treatments groups. Each treatment group contained 6 replicates, 3 male and 3 female, with 12 birds in each replicate. The 3 treatment groups were an uninfected control, an infected control, and an infected group supplemented with B. subtilis PB6 at 500 g/t of feed, containing 5 x 10(11) cfu/kg. Necrotic enteritis was induced in the broiler birds via oral inoculation of 30,000 oocysts of mixed strains of Eimeria species on d 14 followed by C. perfringens (10(8) cfu/mL) on d 19 through 21 of trial. The birds were analyzed for BW gain, mortality, feed conversion ratio (FCR), intestinal lesion score, intestinal C. perfringens counts, and villus histomorphometry. The infected control group showed markedly thickened mucosa, hemorrhages, intestinal lesions, and ballooning of intestine. The supplementation of B. subtilis PB6 reduced the FCR (P < 0.05) and intestinal C. perfringens counts significantly (P < 0.05) compared with the infected control group. It was also observed that B. subtilis PB6 improved villi length by 10.88 and 30.46% (P < 0.05) compared with uninfected and infected control groups, respectively. The group supplemented with B. subtilis PB6 significantly (P < 0.05) increased the villi length to crypt depth ratio by 49.11% compared with the infected group. In conclusion, the supplementation of B. subtilis PB6 not only controlled C. perfringens-induced NE, but also improved intestinal health in the broiler birds.",0
"Streptococcus pyogenes is a human pathogen responsible for a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from mild to life-threatening infections. During the infectious process, the temporal and spatial expression of pathogenicity factors is tightly controlled by a complex network of protein and RNA regulators acting in response to various environmental signals. Here, we focus on the class of small RNA regulators (sRNAs) and present the first complete analysis of sRNA sequencing data in S. pyogenes. In the SF370 clinical isolate (M1 serotype), we identified 197 and 428 putative regulatory RNAs by visual inspection and bioinformatics screening of the sequencing data, respectively. Only 35 from the 197 candidates identified by visual screening were assigned a predicted function (T-boxes, ribosomal protein leaders, characterized riboswitches or sRNAs), indicating how little is known about sRNA regulation in S. pyogenes. By comparing our list of predicted sRNAs with previous S. pyogenes sRNA screens using bioinformatics or microarrays, 92 novel sRNAs were revealed, including antisense RNAs that are for the first time shown to be expressed in this pathogen. We experimentally validated the expression of 30 novel sRNAs and antisense RNAs. We show that the expression profile of 9 sRNAs including 2 predicted regulatory elements is affected by the endoribonucleases RNase III and/or RNase Y, highlighting the critical role of these enzymes in sRNA regulation.",0
"A protein transiently expressed in the neural precursors of developing tissues (TENP) was found to be present in emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) egg white as one of the major proteins. Nucleotide analysis of its encoding cDNA revealed a sequence of 452 amino acids including a 19 amino acid peptide signal. Phylogenetic analysis determined that emu TENP was clustered within the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) superfamily together with other avian TENPs. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the emu TENP gene was highly expressed in the magnum of the oviduct, indicating that TENP is a major egg white component. Emu TENP was purified by anion exchange chromatography and ammonium sulfate fractionation. Unlike BPI, emu TENP exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but not against Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. The results suggest that emu TENP is a potent novel antibacterial protein with a spectrum distinct from that of BPI.",0
"The anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile causes intestinal infections responsible for symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis. Like other bacteria, C. difficile needs to sense and integrate environmental signals in order to adapt to changes and thrive in its environment. The second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) was recently recognized as a quasi-ubiquitous phenotype coordinator in bacteria. Mostly known to be involved in the transition from motile to sessile and multicellular behaviors in Gammaproteobacteria, c-di-GMP is now known to regulate many other phenotypes from cell morphogenesis to virulence, in many Gram-negative and a few Gram-positive bacteria. Herein, we review recent advances in our understanding of c-di-GMP signaling in the lifecycle of C. difficile.",0
"Biological control using antagonistic microbes to minimize the use of chemical pesticides has recently become more prevalent. In an attempt to find an integrated control system for sheath blight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani in rice, Streptomyces philanthi RM-1-138, commercial formulations of Bacillus subtilis as Larminar(A (R)) and B. subtilis strain NSRS 89-24+MK-007 as Biobest(A (R)) and chemical fungicides including carbendazim(A (R)), validamycin(A (R)), propiconazole(A (R)) and mancozeb(A (R)) were applied alone and in combination with S. philanthi RM-1-138. In vitro experiments showed that all treatments tested did provide some control against mycelial growth and sclerotia production by R. solani PTRRS-9. In addition, the four chemical fungicides had no detrimental effects on S. philanthi RM-1-138 even at high concentrations (up to 100 mu g/ml). The efficacy of S. philanthi RM-1-138, the commercial formulations of B. subtilis, chemical fungicides alone or in combination with S. philanthi RM-1-138 was also tested in a greenhouse experiment against sheath blight disease on rice plants. All treatments showed some protection of rice for sheath blight by 47-60 % when carbendazim(A (R)) was applied alone and up to 74 % when combined with S. philanthi RM-1-138.",0
"Three novel thiosemicarbazone O-carboxymethyl chitosan derivatives were obtained via a condensation reaction of thiosemicarbazide O-carboxymethyl chitosan with o-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-methoxybenzaldehyde, and p- chlorobenzaldehyde respectively. Their structures were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, C-13 NMR and X-ray diffraction. The antimicrobial behaviors of the prepared derivatives against three types of bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, RCMBA 2004), Bacillus subtills (B. subtilis, RCMBA 6005), and Escherichia coli (E. Coli, RCMBA 5003) and three crops-threatening pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus, RCMBA 06002), Geotrichum candidum (G. candidum, RCMB 05098), and Candida albicans (C. albicans, RCMB 05035) were investigated. The results indicated that the antibacterial and antifungal activities of the investigated derivatives are much higher than those of the parent O-carboxymethyl chitosan. They were more potent in case of Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of electron withdrawing chlorine atom on the aryl moiety of the aldehyde portion improved greatly antimicrobial activity to be nearly equivalent to the used standard drugs.

"Mupirocin is a commercially available antibiotic that acts on bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and preventing bacterial infection. An in vitro glycosylation approach was applied to synthesize glycoside derivatives of mupirocin using different NDP-sugars and glycosyltransferase from Bacillus licheniformis. Ultra pressure liquid chromatography-photo diode array analyses of the reaction mixtures revealed the generation of product peak(s). The results were further supported by high-resolution quadruple time of flight electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses. The product purified from the reaction mixture with UDP-D-glucose was subjected to NMR analysis, and the structure was determined to be mupirocin 6-O-beta-D-glucoside. Other glycoside analogs of mupirocin were determined based on high-resolution mass analyses. Antibacterial activity assays against Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated complete loss of antibacterial activity after glucosylation of mupirocin at the 6-hydroxyl position.",0
"5'-End-dependent RNA degradation impacts virulence, stress responses, and DNA repair in bacteria by controlling the decay of hundreds of mRNAs. The RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH, a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, triggers this degradation pathway by removing pyrophosphate from the triphosphorylated RNA 5' terminus Here, we report the x-ray structures of Escherichia call RppH (EcRppH) in apo- and RNA-bound forms. These structures show distinct conformations of EcRppH.RNA complexes on the catalytic pathway and suggest a common catalytic mechanism for Nudix hydrolases. EcRppH interacts with RNA by a bipartite mechanism involving specific recognition of the 5'-terminal triphosphate and the second nucleotide, thus enabling discrimination against mononudeotides as substrates. The structures also reveal the molecular basis for the preference of the enzyme for RNA substrates bearing guanine in the second position by identifying a protein cleft in which guanine interacts with EcRppH side chains via cation-pi contacts and hydrogen bonds. These interactions explain the modest specificity of EcRppH at the 5' terminus and distinguish the enzyme from the highly selective RppH present in Bacillus subtilis. The divergent means by which RNA is recognized by these two functionally and structurally analogous enzymes have important implications for mRNA decay and the regulation of protein biosynthesis in bacteria.",0
"Vibrio anguillarum is an aggressive and halophilic bacterial pathogen most commonly originating from seawater. Vibrio anguillarum presence in fisheries and aquaculture facilities causes significant morbidity and mortality among aquaculture species primarily from haemorrhaging of the body and skin of the infected fish that eventually leads to death, collectively recognized as the disease vibriosis. This study served to develop a non-probe, multiplex real-time PCR assay to rapidly detect V.anguillarum presence in seawater. Specific primers targeting genes vah1, empA and rpoN of V.anguillarum were selected for multiplex reaction among 11 different primer sets and the extension step was eliminated. Primer concentration, denaturation time as well as annealing time and temperature of DNA amplification were optimized, thus reducing reaction duration. The two-step, non-probed multiplex real-time PCR set forth by this study detects as little as 3CFUmL(-1) of V.anguillarum presence in sea water, without enrichment cultivation, in 70min with molecular precision and includes melting curve confirmation.",0
"This study was carried out to determine the effects of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L cv. Sardes F-1) production in perlite under unheated greenhouse conditions. Four native bacterial strains (18/1K: Pseudomonas putida, 62: Serratia marcescens, 66/3: Bacillus spp., 70: Pseudomonas fluorescens) and one commercial product (FZB24: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) were tested. Rhizobacteria inoculation took place before sowing and after transplanting. Plants were affected by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cucumerinum occurred naturally and effects of PGPR on cucumber yield were found statistically significant. Plants inoculated with Pseudomonas putida strain 18/1K and Serratia marcescens strain 62 gave significantly higher yield compared to the control plants. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"The objective of the present work was to study the relationship between the dynamic of epiphyte bacteria and the climatic variations in three varieties of pigmented baby lettuce (Lactuca sativa) harvested during 16 consecutive weeks, between February and May, which corresponded with the most important growing period for this crop in the south of Spain. Bacterial counts of the main groups (aerobic bacteria, Pseudomonas and coliforms) were enumerated by plating on the appropriate culture media. Concurrently, characterization of the culturable bacterial community present on the leaf surface was performed by partial sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. To relate bacteria counts with weather variation first the main weather modes by principal component analysis (PCA) of climatic variables were characterized. Then, multiple linear regression models, with bacteria count as the dependent variable and the PCA factors as the independent variables, were built. The results obtained showed that the diversity and abundance of the epiphytic community of baby lettuce were affected by the climate variations. However, other factors such as the environment and the agricultural practices may play a role because the R-2 obtained was relatively low. Thus, the harvest week as well as the variations in radiation, rainfall and relative humidity (RH) explained part of the observed differences. Pseudomonas growth was influenced by the variations in radiation, rainfall, wind and temperature, the latter being the most relevant variable. Coliform growth was influenced by variations in temperature and RH. Bacillus and Pseudomonas were the most predominant genera identified among the isolates, their growth showing a negative correlation (P < 0.01) through the weeks of the study in two of the three lettuce varieties evaluated. Given the diverse functions of phyllospheric microbes, understanding the variations of specific communities such as Pseudomonas spp. due to the climate change could help to understand the different susceptibilities-of crops to be affected by spoilage or pathogenic bacteria.

"Amino acid conjugates of quinolone, metronidazole and sulfadiazine antibiotics were synthesized in good yields using benzotriazole methodology. All the conjugates were screened for their antibacterial activity using methods adapted from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Antibiotic conjugates were tested for activity in four medically relevant organisms; Staphylococcus aureus (RN4220), Escherichia coli (DH5a), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1), and Bacillus subtilis (168). Several antibiotic conjugates show promising results against several of the strains screened. (c) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
"Alcohol impairs the host immune system, rendering the host more vulnerable to infection. Therefore, alcoholics are at increased risk of acquiring serious bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, including pneumonia. Nevertheless, how alcohol affects pneumococcal virulence remains unclear. Here, we showed that the S. pneumoniae type 2 D39 strain is ethanol tolerant and that alcohol upregulates alcohol dehydrogenase E (AdhE) and potentiates pneumolysin (Ply). Hemolytic activity, colonization, and virulence of S. pneumoniae, as well as host cell myeloperoxidase activity, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and inflammation, were significantly attenuated in adhE mutant bacteria (Delta adhE strain) compared to D39 wild-type bacteria. Therefore, AdhE might act as a pneumococcal virulence factor. Moreover, in the presence of ethanol, S. pneumoniae AdhE produced acetaldehyde and NADH, which subsequently led Rex (redox-sensing transcriptional repressor) to dissociate from the adhE promoter. An increase in AdhE level under the ethanol condition conferred an increase in Ply and H2O2 levels. Consistently, S. pneumoniae D39 caused higher cytotoxicity to RAW 264.7 cells than the Delta adhE strain under the ethanol stress condition, and ethanol-fed mice (alcoholic mice) were more susceptible to infection with the D39 wild-type bacteria than with the Delta adhE strain. Taken together, these data indicate that AdhE increases Ply under the ethanol stress condition, thus potentiating pneumococcal virulence.",0
"Lichen metabolites have multiple functions in nature and these include several biological activities against pathogens and multi-drug resistant bacteria. This study shows the antibacterial properties of 18 Usnea species collected from five provinces in the northern part of Luzon, Philippines. A total of 41 lichen specimens were extracted using acetone to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. The crude extracts were initially subjected to TLC. Interestingly, 17 different lichen metabolites were identified. The 41 crude lichen extracts were then tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis using paper-disk diffusion assay, most of which were found to be more active against the latter test organism. In addition, 28 of the 41 lichen extracts were also tested against Mycobacterium phlei. Interestingly, most of the samples exhibited much greater activities than that of the antibiotics used as indicated by the zones of inhibition. Moreover, 15 crude extracts showing distinct spots in their TLC profiles were tested against Nocardia asteroides using TLC-bioautography. Results showed that usnic acid, norstictic acid, and salazinic acid were the bioactive lichen metabolites.",0
"Inhibition of bacterial nitric oxide synthase (bNOS) has the potential to improve the efficacy of antimicrobials used to treat infections by Gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis. However, inhibitor specificity toward bNOS over the mammalian NOS (mNOS) isoforms remains a challenge because of the near identical NOS active sites. One key structural difference between the NOS isoforms is the amino acid composition of the pterin cofactor binding site that is adjacent to the NOS active site. Previously, we demonstrated that a NOS inhibitor targeting both the active and pterin sites was potent and functioned as an antimicrobial (Holden, , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013, 110, 18127). Here we present additional crystal structures, binding analyses, and bacterial killing studies of inhibitors that target both the active and pterin sites of a bNOS and function as antimicrobials. Together, these data provide a framework for continued development of bNOS inhibitors, as each molecule represents an excellent chemical scaffold for the design of isoform selective bNOS inhibitors.",0
"Skin diseases such as dermatitis, prurigo, and scabies present a major health concern in the Eastern Cape, South Africa, where there is a scarcity of dermatologists, compounded by the fact that most dermatologists are centered near urban areas and are not accessible to 70% of the rural population. Hence, many people still depend to a large extent on traditional herbs such as Citrus limon for the treatment of skin diseases. The aim of this study was therefore to screen the acetone and ethanol extracts of Citrus limon for its antioxidant potential and Antimicrobial efficacy agents against a panel of microbes implicated in skin diseases. The highest antibacterial activity was obtained with the acetone extract of C. limon against Enterococcus faecatis and Bacillus subtilis, and the most susceptible bacteria based on the overall mean inhibition diameters were the gram-negative Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei and the gram-positive E. faecalis and B. subtilis. Both extracts were active against Candida glabrata. The DPPH scavenging activity of the acetone extract was not significantly different from those of vitamin C and rutin. Nitric oxide scavenging activity was lowest in the ethanol extract of C limon. The reducing ability of both plant extracts was significantly lower than that of vitamin C and rutin. The fact that both extracts of C limon exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and comparable efficacy to the synthetic antioxidants highlights the medicinal value of C limon as a potential source for drug development amidst the obvious dearth of effective and safe antibacterial drugs, and also validates the ethnotherapeutic claim of the plant.

"Bacterial natural genetic competence - well studied in Bacillus subtilis - enables cells to take up and integrate extracellularly supplied DNA into their own genonne. However, little is known about competence development and its regulation in other members of the genus, although DNA uptake machineries are routinely encoded. Auxotrophic Bacillus licheniformis 9945A derivatives, obtained from repeated rounds of random mutagenesis, were long known to develop natural competence. Inspection of the colony morphology and extracellular enzyme secretion of two of these derivatives, M28 and M18, suggested that regulator genes are collaterally hit. M28 emerged as a 14 bp deletion mutant concomitantly displaying a shift in the reading frame of degS that encodes the sensor histidine kinase, which is part of the molecular switch that directs cells to genetic competence, the synthesis of extracellular enzymes or biofilm formation, while for M18, sequencing of the suspected gene revealed a 375 bp deletion in abrB, encoding the major transition state regulator. With respect to colony morphology, enzyme secretion and competence development, both of the mutations, when newly generated on the wild-type B. licheniformis 9945A genetic background, resulted in phenotypes resembling M28 and M18, respectively. All of the known naturally competent B. licheniformis representatives, hitherto thoroughly investigated in this regard, carry mutations in regulator genes, and hence genetic competence observed in domesticated strains supposedly results from deregulation.",0
"The aim of this study was to investigate antioxidant activities, antibacterial activities and a phytochemical constituent of Asparagus laricinus stem and leaf extracts. Determination of antibacterial activity of extracts was assessed by agar dilution method and antioxidant properties by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the leaf was at a concentration of 0.125 mg/mL against S. saprophyticus and E. cloacae, and at a concentration of 1 mg/mL against S. aureus and B. subtilis. There was no MIC of the stem extract at any concentration. The leaf extract showed effective free radical scavenging activity (72.1%), while stem extract had low activity. Qualitative phytochemical analysis of these plant extracts revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, flavonoids and phlobatannins. The leaf extract further confirmed the presence of glycosides, steroids, ternoids and carbohydrates. Our results indicate that, A. laricinus leaf extracts have potential antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.",0
"To understand the influence of different hydrophobic amino acids at ""a"" and ""d"" positions of a heptad repeat sequence on antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and antiendotoxin properties, four 15-residue peptides with leucine (LRP), phenylalanine (FRP), valine (VRP), and alanine (ARP) residues at these positions were designed, synthesized, and characterized. Although valine is similarly hydrophobic to leucine and phenylalanine, VRP showed significantly lesser cytotoxicity than LRP and FRP; further, the replacement of leucines with valines at ""a"" and ""d"" positions of melittin-heptads drastically reduced its cytotoxicity. However, all four peptides exhibited significant antimicrobial activities that correlate well with their interactions with mammalian and bacterial cell membranes and the corresponding lipid vesicles. LRP most efficiently neutralized the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory mediators like NO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in macrophages followed by FRP, VRP, and ARP. The results could be useful for designing short antimicrobial and antiendotoxin peptides with understanding the basis of their activity.",0
"The experiment evaluated the probiotic properties of the Bacillus subtilis BY-2 which grow fast and degrade cellulose efficiently from Tibetan pigs cecum. The results showed that BY-2 could tolerate high temperature. The survival rate of BY-2 reached above 90% when cultured at 65-85°C for 20 min, which was significantly higher than that (50.1%) of 100°C ( P<0.05). When cultured in artificial gastric fluid, there was an upward trend with the increase of pH value. The survival rate was 73.78%-83.61% when cultured under pH1-4 for 4 hours. While the survival rate of BY-2 under the condition of pH1 was significantly lower than that under pH2-4 ( P<0.05). Artificial intestinal fluid of different concentration of bile salt also affected the survival rate of BY-2 while the impact of bile salt on the survival rate of BY 2 was not significant ( P>0.05). The survival rate of BY-2 was more than 75% when cultured under artificial intestinal fluid with different concentration of bile salt for 4 h. Furthermore, the extract of BY-2 had a potent inhibitory ability to Escherichia, Salmonella and Staphylococcus. From the results of the experiment, it was found that BY-2 had a strong resilience characteristics and antibacterial properties, which has a potential of probiotics for pigs.",0
"Development of mucosal vaccines strongly relies on an efficient delivery system and, over the years, a variety of approaches based on phages, bacteria or synthetic nanoparticles have been proposed to display and deliver antigens. The spore of Bacillus subtilis displaying heterologous antigens has also been considered as a mucosal vaccine vehicle, and shown able to conjugate some advantages of live microrganisms with some of synthetic nanoparticles. Here we review the use of non-recombinant spores of B. subtilis as a delivery system for mucosal immunizations. The non-recombinant display is based on the adsorption of heterologous molecules on the spore surface without the need of genetic manipulations, thus avoiding all concerns about the use and environmental release of genetically modified microorganisms. In addition, adsorbed molecules are stabilized and protected by the interaction with the spore, suggesting that this system could reduce the rapid degradation of the antigen, often observed with other delivery systems and identified as a major drawback of mucosal vaccines.",0
"New Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes of acetyl coumarin derivatives with gatifloxacin were synthesized. Characterization of the complexes was carried out by elemental analysis, FT-IR, FAB-MS, electronic spectra and magnetic measurement along with thermo gravimetric studies. Thermal study reveals the absence of coordinated water molecule in case of Cu(II) complexes. All the Cu(II) complexes were found more potent antibacterial activity compared to Ni(II) complexes. The antituberculosis data have shown that copper conjugation may be advantageous in designing highly effective drugs for antitubercular therapy. These complexes were also found to be potent antioxidizing agents comprising radical scavenging capability and ferric reducing abilities.",0
"A novel method for integrating multicopy exogenous gene expression unit into the same location of Bacillus subtilis genome was provided in this study. Using beta-amylase expression unit as an example, the method includes the following steps: First of all, a integrating plasmid pMLK83-CTBA which contains one copy of beta-amylase expression unit was constructed and subsequently transformed into Bacillus subtilis strain 1A751 to obtain the recombinant strain 1A751 [CTBA] Neo+, in which one copy of beta-amylase expression unit was integrated by double crossover. Then, using resistance gene replacement plasmid pVK71, 1A751 [CTBA] Neo-Spe+ was obtained, in which neomycin resistance gene was substituted to spectinomycin resistance gene. Finally, the integrating plasmid pMLK83-CTBA was used again to integrate beta _amylase expression unit into 1A751 [CTBA] Neo-Spe+ by single crossover, and the recombinant strain 1A751 [CTBA2] Neo+Spe+ with two copies of beta-amylase expression unit integrated in genome was selected by neomycin and spectinomycin resistance screening. The result shows that the beta-amylase gene copies via this method can significantly and stably increase secretory expression of beta-amylase enzyme activity.",1
"Type I toxin-antitoxin systems encoded on bacterial chromosomes became the focus of research during the past years. However, little is known in terms of structural requirements, kinetics of interaction with their targets and regulatory mechanisms of the antitoxin RNAs. Here, we present a combined in vitro and in vivo analysis of the bsrG/SR4 type I toxin-antitoxin system from Bacillus subtilis. The secondary structures of SR4 and bsrG mRNA and of the SR4/bsrG RNA complex were determined, apparent binding rate constants calculated and functional segments required for complex formation narrowed down. The initial contact between SR4 and its target was shown to involve the SR4 terminator loop and loop 3 of bsrG mRNA. Additionally, a contribution of the stem of SR4 stem-loop 3 to target binding was found. On SR4/bsrG complex formation, a 4 bp double-stranded region sequestering the bsrG Shine Dalgarno (SD) sequence was extended to 8 bp. Experimental evidence was obtained that this extended region caused translation inhibition of bsrG mRNA. Therefore, we conclude that SR4 does not only promote degradation of the toxin mRNA but also additionally inhibit its translation. This is the first case of a dual-acting antitoxin RNA.",0
"AimsTo detect and characterize broad-spectrum antipathogen activity of indigenous bacterial isolates obtained from potato soil and soya bean leaves for their potential to be developed as biofungicides to control soilborne diseases such as Fusarium crown and root rot of tomato (FCRR) caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (Forl). Methods and ResultsThirteen bacterial isolates (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (four isolates), Paenibacillus polymyxa (three isolates), Pseudomonas chlororaphis (two isolates), Pseudomonas fluorescens (two isolates), Bacillus subtilis (one isolate) and Pseudomonas sp. (one isolate)) or their volatiles showed antagonistic activity against most of the 10 plant pathogens in plate assays. Cell-free culture filtrates (CF) of five isolates or 1-butanol extracts of CFs also inhibited the growth of most pathogen mycelia in plate assays. PCR analysis confirmed the presence of most antibiotic biosynthetic genes such as phlD, phzFA, prnD and pltC in most Pseudomonas isolates and bmyB, bacA, ituD, srfAA and fenD in most Bacillus isolates. These bacterial isolates varied in the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), siderophores, -1,3-glucanases, chitinases, proteases, indole-3-acetic acid, salicylic acid, and for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis identified 10 volatile compounds from 10 isolates and 18 compounds from 1-butanol extracts of CFs of five isolates. Application of irradiated peat formulation of six isolates to tomato roots prior to transplanting in a Forl-infested potting mix and field soil provided protection of tomato plants from FCRR disease and enhanced plant growth under greenhouse conditions. ConclusionsFive of the 13 indigenous bacterial isolates were antagonistic to eight plant pathogens, both in vitro and in vivo. Antagonistic and plant-growth promotion activities of these isolates might be related to the production of several types of antibiotics, lytic enzymes, phytohormones, secondary metabolites, siderophores and volatile compounds; however, any specific role of each needs to be determined. Significance and Impact of the StudyIndigenous antagonistic bacterial isolates have the potential to be developed as biofungicides for minimizing early crop losses due to soilborne diseases caused by Fusarium and other soilborne pathogens.",0
"Fusarium toxins with reference to fumonisin B1 (FB1) have long been regarded as contaminants of maize and maize-based related products. However, when consumed they can cause intoxication, especially in humans. Therefore, effective quantitative methods for assessing the dietary exposure of this toxic fungal metabolite are required. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effect on the use of a bio-wipe kit, which is a faecal material collection kit, to detect the presence of FB1. Faecal materials were collected from a rural farming community in Gauteng Province, South Africa. In total, 200 samples of faecal material were analysed for Fusarium species using a serial dilution method, while FB1 was further analysed and quantified by reversed-phase TLC and HPLC. The study showed the presence of 11 different Fusarium species grown on potato dextrose agar culture medium of which F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum, producers of FB1, and F. oxysporum were the dominant species. Fumonisin B1 was recorded at an incidence rate of 65% of the total using TLC. Results from HPLC showed that 84% were positive at different ranges of concentration for FB1. This study supports the use of a bio-wipe as a rapid method to determine human exposure to FB1.",0
"Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICEs) are bacterial mobile genetic elements that play a key role in bacterial genomes dynamics and evolution. ICEs are widely distributed among virtually all bacterial genera. Recent extensive studies have unraveled their high diversity and complexity. The present review depicts the general conserved features of ICEs and describes more precisely three major families of ICEs that have been extensively studied in the past decade for their biology, their evolution and their impact on genomes dynamics. First, the large SXT/R391 family of ICEs disseminates antibiotic resistance genes and drives the exchange of mobilizable genomic islands (MGIs) between many enteric pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae. Second, ICEBs1 of Bacillus subtilis is the most well understood ICE of Gram-positive bacteria, notably regarding the regulation of its dissemination and its initially unforeseen extrachromosomal replication, which could be a common feature of ICEs of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Finally, ICESt1 and ICESt3 of Streptococcus thermophilus are the prototypes of a large family of ICEs widely distributed among various streptococci. These ICEs carry an original regulation module that associates regulators related to those of both SXT/R391 and ICEBs1. Study of ICESt1 and ICESt3 uncovered the cis-mobilization of related genomic islands (CIMEs) by a mechanism called accretion-mobilization, which likely represents a paradigm for the evolution of many ICEs and genomic islands. These three major families of ICEs give a glimpse about ICEs dynamics and their high impact on bacterial adaptation.",0
"Antibiotic resistance is considered one of the world's major public health concerns. The main cause of bacterial resistance is the improper and repeated use of antibiotics. To alleviate this problem, new chemical substances against microorganisms are being synthesized and tested. Thiazolidines are compounds having many pharmacological activities including antimicrobial activities. For this purpose some thiazolidine derivatives substituted at position 5 in the thiazolidine nucleus were synthesized and tested against several microorganisms. Using a disc diffusion method, antimicrobial activity was verified against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and alcohol acid resistant bacteria and yeast. The minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined. All derivatives showed antimicrobial activity mainly against Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values ranging from 2 to 16 mu g/mL.",0
"Some bacterial aconitases are bifunctional proteins that function in the citric acid cycle and act as posttranscriptional regulators in response to iron levels and oxidative stress. We explore the role of aconitase (AcnB) in Helicobacter pylori as a posttranscriptional regulator of the cell wall-modifying enzyme peptidoglycan deacetylase, PgdA. Under oxidative stress, PgdA is highly expressed and confers resistance to lysozyme in wild-type cells. PgdA protein expression as well as transcript abundance is significantly decreased in an acnB mutant. In the wild type, pgdA mRNA half-life was 13 min, whereas the half-life for the acnB strain was 7 min. Based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays and RNA footprinting, the H. pylori apo-AcnB binds to the 3'-untranslated region of the pgdA RNA transcript. Some of the protected bases (from footprinting) were localized in proposed stem-loop structures. AcnB-pgdA transcript binding was abolished by the addition of iron. The acnB strain is more susceptible to lysozyme-mediated killing and was attenuated in its ability to colonize mice. The results support a model whereby apo-AcnB directly interacts with the pgdA transcript to enhance stability and increase deacetylase enzyme expression, which impacts in vivo survival.",0
"beta-Lactam antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins, are commonly used in veterinary medicine. Illegal use and abuse of beta-lactams could cause allergy and selected bacterial resistance. BlaR-CTD, the carboxy-terminal of penicillin-recognizing protein BlaR from Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 14580, was utilized in this study to develop a receptor-based ELISA for detection and determination of beta-lactam antibiotics in milk, beef, and chicken. This assay was based on directly competitive inhibition of binding of horseradish peroxidase-labeled ampicillin to the immobilized BlaR-CTD by beta-lactams. The assay was developed as screening test with the option as semiquantitative assay, when the identity of a single type of residual beta-lactam was known. The IC50 values of 15 beta-lactam antibiotics, including benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, dicloxacillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, cefapirin, cefoperazone, cefalotin, cefazolin, cefquinome, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefalexin, ceftiofur and its metabolite desfuroylceftiofur were evaluated and ranged from 0.18 to 170.81 mu g L-1. Simple sample extraction method was carried out with only phosphate-buffered saline, and the recoveries of selected beta-lactam antibiotics in milk, beef, and chicken were in the range of 53.27 to 128.29 %, most ranging from 60 to 120 %. The inter-assay variability was below 30 %. Limits of detection in milk, beef, and chicken muscles with cefquinome matrix calibration were 2.10, 30.68, and 31.13 mu g kg(-1), respectively. This study firstly established a rapid, simple, and accurate method for simultaneous detection of 15 beta-lactams in edible tissues, among which 11 beta-lactams controlled by European Union could be detected below maximum residue limits.",0
"Administration of probiotic Lactobacillus cultures is an important alternative to the use of antibiotic growth promoters and has been demonstrated to improve animal health, growth performance, and preharvest food safety in poultry production. Whereas gastrointestinal colonization is thought to be critical to their probiotic functionality, factors important to Lactobacillus colonization in chickens are not well understood. In this study we investigate epithelial cell adhesion in vitro and colonization of Lactobacillus in vivo in broiler chickens. Adhesion of Lactobacillus cultures to epithelial cells was evaluated using the chicken LMH cell line. Lactobacillus cultures were able adhere effectively to LMH cells relative to Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella Typhimurium. Epithelial cell adhesion was similar for Lactobacillus crispatus TDCC 75, L. cristpatus TDCC 76, and Lactobacillus gallinarum TDCC 77, and all 3 were more adherent than L. gallinarum TDCC 78. However, when colonization was evaluated in the ileum and cecum of broiler chicks, L. crispatus TDCC 75 and L. gallinarum TDCC 77 were more persistent than L. crispatus TDCC 76 and L. gallinarum TDCC 78. The reduction of growth in medium supplemented with oxgal was greater for L. gallinarum TDCC 78 than L. gallinarum TDCC 77, suggesting that whereas adhesion was similar for the 2 strains, the difference in colonization between L. gallinarum strains may be due in part to their bile sensitivity. This study demonstrates that whereas adhesion to epithelial cells may be important in predicting gastrointestinal colonization, other factors including bile tolerance may also contribute to the colonization of Lactobacillus in poultry. Additionally, the chicken LMH cell line is expected to provide a platform for investigating mechanisms of Lactobacillus adhesion to epithelial tissue and evaluating the probiotic potential Lactobacillus in poultry.",0
"Health promoting cold pressed oils may improve human health and prevent certain diseases. It is hard to find any research concerning the composition and functional properties of cold pressed clove (Syzygium aromaticum) oil (CO). Cold pressed CO was evaluated for its lipid classes, fatty acid profiles, and tocol contents. In addition, antiradical and antimicrobial properties of CO were evaluated. The amounts of neutral lipids in CO was the highest (approximate to 94.7% of total lipids), followed by glycolipids and phospholipids. The main fatty acids in CO were linoleic and oleic, which comprise together approximate to 80% of total fatty acids. Stearic and palmitic acids were the main saturated fatty acids. - and -tocopherols and -tocotrienol were the main detected tocols. CO had higher antiradical action against DPPH center dot and galvinoxyl radicals than virgin olive oil. The results of antimicrobial properties revealed that CO inhibited the growth of all tested microorganisms. CO had a drastic effect on the biosynthesis of proteins and lipids in cells of Bacillus subtilis. In consideration of potential utilization, detailed knowledge on the composition and functional properties of CO is of major importance.",0
"Here, we report what we believe to be the first case of bacteraemia with small colony variants of Bacillus licheniformis related to a pacemaker lead infection by B. licheniformis displaying the normal phenotype. Arbitrarily primed PCR analysis showed a clonal strain. The infection was cured after the removal of the infected device.",1
"Due to the emergence and rapid spread of drug resistance in bacteria, there is an urgent need for the development of novel antimicrobials. SecA, a key component of the general bacterial secretion system required for viability and virulence, is an attractive antimicrobial target. Earlier we reported that systematical dissection of a SecA inhibitor, Rose Bengal (RB), led to the development of novel small molecule SecA inhibitors active against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In this study, two potent RB analogs were further evaluated for activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains and for their mechanism of actions. These analogs showed inhibition on the ATPase activities of S. aureus SecA1 (SaSecA1) and SecA2 (SaSecA2), and inhibition of SaSecA1-dependent protein-conducting channel. Moreover, these inhibitors reduce the secretion of three toxins from S. aureus and exert potent bacteriostatic effects against three MRSA strains. Our best inhibitor SCA-50 showed potent concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against MRSA Mu50 strain and very importantly, 2-60 fold more potent inhibitory effect on MRSA Mu50 than all the commonly used antibiotics including vancomycin, which is considered the last resort option in treating MRSA-related infections. Protein pull down experiments further confirmed SaSecA1 as a target. Deletion or overexpression of NorA and MepA efflux pumps had minimal effect on the antimicrobial activities against S. aureus, indicating that the effects of SecA inhibitors were not affected by the presence of these efflux pumps. Our studies show that these small molecule analogs target SecA functions, have potent antimicrobial activities, reduce the secretion of toxins, and have the ability to overcome the effect efflux pumps, which are responsible for multi-drug resistance. Thus, targeting SecA is an attractive antimicrobial strategy against MRSA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"A bacterial strain BGI-1 was isolated from the gut of German cockroaches (Blattella germanica L.) and was identified as Bacillus subtilis based on 16S rDNA sequence and morphological, physiological, and biochemical characters. The strain BGI-1 inhibited the growth of Beauveria bassiana; the diameter of the inhibition zone exceeded 30 mm. Vesicles were observed in B. bassiana hyphae on the edge of the inhibition zone. Fermentation of BGI-1 reduced the conidial germination rate by 12%. Further studies demonstrated that B. bassiana infections in German cockroaches orally treated with the extracts of BGI-1 fermentation were significantly weakened. Cumulative mortality rate was 49.5% in the treatment group at the 20 d, while that of the control group was 62.3%. The study intends to understand the relationship between the intestinal flora and the cockroach. Those microbes with anti-entomopathogenic fungi activity might contribute to resisting the infection of pathogenic fungi.",0
"Three new phthalide derivatives, emefuranones A(1), A(2) and B (1-3); six new phthalane derivatives, emefuran A, B-1, B-2, C-1, C-2 and D (4-9); three new farnesylated phthalide derivatives, farnesylemefuranones A-C (10-12); xylarinol C (13); and emericelloxide (14), along with four known compounds (dustanin, sorbicillin, aspergillodiol and xylarinol A), were isolated from the culture extracts of Emericella sp. IFM57991. Structures of 1-14 were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and chemical evidence. Compounds 4-7 and 13 showed moderate antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis.",0
"This study shows that Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ACB-K1 and ACB-CR1) and Bacillus subtilis (ACB-69 and ACB-84) isolates perform differently on the control of green mold (Penicillium digitatum), depending on the citrus variety. In 'Murcott' tangor, the yeast ACB-CR1 resulted in 47% of healthy fruits, which increased to 67% when combined with imazalil 0.5 mL L-1. In the 'Hamlin' orange, ACB-CR1 (S. cerevisiae) provided 87% control when applied alone. However, when combined with 0.5 and 1.0 mL L-1 of fungicide (the lowest doses), the efficiency of ACB-CR1 was decreased, yielding 76 and 78% healthy fruits, respectively. Both yeasts controlled green mold in the 'Tahiti' acid lime by 40% when used as a curative treatment; however, the ACB-K1 isolate that was applied as a preventive measure was the best antagonist, yielding 73% healthy fruits. This yeast increased disease control, with healthy fruit percentages ranging from 84 to 89% when the microorganism was combined with the lowest doses of imazalil. In general, B. subtilis isolates provided only slight disease control when tested in the three citrus fruit varieties during this study. However, the results of preventive treatments with bacteria on 'Tahiti' acid lime fruits revealed an improvement in the degree of biocontrol. This study demonstrated the possibility of reducing the imazalil dose during the post-harvest citrus fruit treatment using a biocontrol agent without losing green mold control efficiency under storage conditions (27 C and 70% RH [relative humidity]). The preventive application provided the best protection to 'Tahiti' acid lime fruits, suggesting that the mode of action of these biocontrol agents is through competition, or even resistance induction, considering the specificity of the antagonist-host relationship within the context of pathogen control. The yeast isolates decreased their antagonistic activity against P. digitatum under refrigeration (10 C and 95% RH). However, the ACB-1(1 isolate provided 100% disease control in 'Tahiti' acid lime fruits under these storage conditions when combined with a quarter dose of imazalil, despite its low activity.

"In search of environmentally-friendly ionic liquids (ILs), 14 were prepared based on the imidazolium, pyridinium and choline cations, with bromide and several amino acids as anions. Good yields were obtained in the synthesis of pyridinium ILs and those prepared from choline and amino acids. Four of the ILs synthesized from choline and the amino acids arginine, glutamine, glutamic acid and cystine are described here for the first time. The toxicity of the synthesized ILs was checked against organisms of various levels of organization: the crustacean Anemia sauna; Human cell HeLa (cervical carcinoma); and bacteria with different types of cell wall, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. The toxicity was observed to depend on both the cation and anion. Choline-amino acid ILs showed a remarkable low toxicity to A. sauna and HeLa cell culture, ten times less than imidazolium and pyridinium ILs. None of ionic liquids exhibited marked toxicity to bacteria, and the effect was 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the antibiotic chloramphenicol. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"The peptidoglycan layers of many gram-positive bacteria are densely functionalized with anionic glycopolymers known as wall teichoic acids (WTAs). These polymers play crucial roles in cell shape determination, regulation of cell division, and other fundamental aspects of gram-positive bacterial physiology. Additionally, WTAs are important in pathogenesis and play key roles in antibiotic resistance. We provide an overview of WTA structure and biosynthesis, review recent studies on the biological roles of these polymers, and highlight remaining questions. We also discuss prospects for exploiting WTA biosynthesis as a target for new therapies to overcome resistant infections.",0
"Marine sponges which are known to own multiple functional properties have created significant interest among the researchers due to their biological activities and impending application in different industries. The aim of this study was to obtained bioactive components of sponges. Gelliodes carnosa sponge was collected from Nay Band Bay (Persian Gulf waters) and antimicrobial activities of crude extracts were explored by calculation of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) in media supplement with different concentrations of extract solutions. Seven extracts of sponge with solvents of different polarity (E1: Ethanol, E2: Methanol, E3: Acetone, E4: Ethyl acetate, E5: Chloroform, E6: Mixed (Ethanol: Ethyl acetate: Methanol 1: 2: 1), E7: Distilled water) were evaluated through disc diffusion assay. Different extracts were inhibited the growth of bacteria (70%) more frequently compared to fungal strains (26%). Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive (72%) to many extract compared to Gram-positive bacteria (65%). Considerable antibacterial activity was exhibited by E6 against Bacillus subtilis (MIC: 203 mu g/ml), Klebsiella pneumonia (MIC: 203 mu g/ml), Escherichia coli (MIC: 407 mu g/ml) and Fusarium solani (MIC: 500 mu g/ml). Strong antifungal activity was obtained by E4 against Fusarium sp.2, Fusarium sp.1, F. solani and Saprolegnia parasitica (MIC: 500 mu g/ml). This is the first report of antimicrobial and antifungal activities of G. carnosa extracts.",0
"The antibacterial activity against bacterial plant pathogens and its relationships with the presence of the cyclic lipopeptide (cLP) biosynthetic genes ituC (iturin), bmyB (bacillomycin), fenD (fengycin) and srfAA (surfactin), and their corresponding antimicrobial peptide products have been studied in a collection of 64 strains of Bacillus spp. isolated from plant environments. The most frequent antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes were bmyB, srfAAand fenD (34-50% of isolates). Most isolates (98.4%) produced surfactin isoforms, 90.6% iturins and 79.7% fengycins. The antibacterial activity was very frequent and generally intense among the collection of strains because 75% of the isolates were active against at least 6 of the 8 bacterial plant pathogens tested. Hierarchical and correspondence analysis confirmed the presence of two clearly differentiated groups. One group consisted of Bacillus strains that showed a strong antibacterial activity, presented several cLPs genes and produced several isoforms of cLPs simultaneously, mainly composed of B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens, although the last one was exclusive to this group. Another group was characterized by strains with very low or none antibacterial activity, that showed one or none of the cLP genes and produced a few or none of the corresponding cLPs, and was the most heterogenous group including B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. cereusand B. thuringiensis, although the last two were exclusive to this group. This work demonstrated that the antagonistic capacity of plant-associated Bacillusagainst plant pathogenic bacteria is related to the presence of cLP genes and to the production of the corresponding cLPs, and it is mainly associated to the species B. subtilisand B. amyloliquefaciens. Our findings would help to increase the yield and efficiency of screening methods to obtain candidate strains to biocontrol agents with a mechanism of action relaying on the production of antimicrobial cLPs.",1
"The Staphylococcus aureus genome contains three toxin-antitoxin modules, including one mazEF module, SamazEF. Using an on-column separation protocol we are able to obtain large amounts of wild-type SaMazF toxin. The protein is well-folded and highly resistant against thermal unfolding but aggregates at elevated temperatures. Crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution studies show a well-defined dimer. Differences in structure and dynamics between the X-ray and NMR structural ensembles are found in three loop regions, two of which undergo motions that are of functional relevance. The same segments also show functionally relevant dynamics in the distantly related CcdB family despite divergence of function. NMR chemical shift mapping and analysis of residue conservation in the MazF family suggests a conserved mode for the inhibition of MazF by MazE.",0
"Antimicrobial resistance and plasmid profile of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from the urbanized Eltsovka-1 River (Russia) were investigated. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA of of G+ strains showed 99-100% identity to that of Bacillus aerophilus, Bacillus altitudinis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus anthrancis, Bacillus barbaricus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus flexus, Bacillus indriensis, Bacillus stratosphericus, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Streptomyces albidoflavus, Streptomyces albus, Streptomyces exfoliatus, Streptomyces odorifer, and Streptomyces sampsonii. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA of G-strains was similar in 99-100% to that of Aeromonas bestiarum, Aeromonas encheleia, Aeromonas hydrophila, A. hydrophila subsp. anaerogenes, A. hydrophila subsp. dhakensis, Aeromonas media, Aeromonas molluscorum, Aeromonas popoffii, Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. masoucida, A. salmonicida subsp. pectinolytica, A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, Aeromonas punctata, Aeromonas sobria, and Shewanella putrefaciens. The highest percentage (88.4%) of strains was resistant to polymyxin B followed by 69% to lincomycin, 61.5% to benzilpenicillin, 57.7% to ampicillin, and 50% to carbenicillin. A low level of resistance (4%) was found to kanamycin (8%), to streptomycin (11.5%), to neomycin and tetracycline, and (15%) to erythromycin. No resistance was found to gentamycin, monomycin, and chloroamphenicol. The majority (80.7%) of strains was multidrug-resistant. Ninety-two percent of all strains carried plasmid DNA of various sizes.",0
"The development of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria combined with increased implant-associated infections have determined a great interest towards new bactericidal materials containing various organic and inorganic substances. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) derived materials have received considerable attention due to their unique antibacterial, antifungal, and UV filtering properties as well as high catalytic and photochemical activities. In the present work, we investigate the antimicrobial properties against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) of ZnO microrods (MRs) and nanorods (NRs), produced in bulk quantities through simple and inexpensive methods. We demonstrate that the antimicrobial effect is strongly dependent on the rod size and dose. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the two investigated microbial types interact differently with the ZnO-MRs and NRs due to their different morphology. This resulted in different outcomes as reported by their respective Colony Forming Unit (CFU) capabilities. Moreover, Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy revealed that changes in cell outer structures, i.e. membrane and exopolysaccharides (EPS), produced by the interaction with the ZnO structures, are responsible for the antimicrobial mechanism without the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. This was further strengthened by the increased survival observed in the case of bacterial cells treated in the presence of an osmotic support, like glycerol. In addition, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis showed that reduced cell viability is not strictly correlated to increased zinc ion release in the suspension. We then concluded that ZnO-NRs have a superior antimicrobial effect against both S. aureus and B. subtilis at much lower doses when compared to ZnO-MRs. This is mainly due to the smaller diameter of the NRs, which promotes surface damaging and protein alteration of the cell wall. Finally, the lack of toxicity and the antimicrobial properties of ZnO-NRs versus S. aureus, validated in vivo using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as host infection model, confirm the promising exploitation of ZnO-NRs in biomedical applications.",0
"Listeria monocytogenes, causative agent of human listeriosis, has been isolated from a wide variety of foods including deli meats, soft cheeses, cantaloupes, sprouts and canned mushrooms. Standard control measures for restricting microbial growth such as refrigeration and high salt are often inadequate as L. monocytogenes grows quite well in these environments. In an effort to better understand the genetic and physiological basis by which L. monocytogenes circumvents these controls, a transposon library of L. monocytogenes was screened for changes in their ability to grow in 7% NaCl and/ or at 5 degrees C. This work identified a transposon insertion upstream of an operon, here named lstABC, that led to a reduction in growth in 7% NaCl. In-frame deletion studies identified lstC which codes for a GNAT-acetyltransferase being responsible for the phenotype. Transcriptomic and RT-PCR analyses identified nine genes that were upregulated in the presence of high salt in the Delta lstC mutant. Further analysis of lstC and the genes affected by Delta lstC is needed to understand LstC's role in salt tolerance. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",0
"In this study, the role of a salt-tolerant plant growth-promoting bacterium (PGPR), Bacillus subtilis, in the alleviation of salinity stress during the growth of Indian bassia (Bassia indica [Wight] A.J. Scott), was studied under ccontrolled growth chamber conditions following seed inoculation. Physiological parameters such as neutral and phospholipids, fatty acid composition as well as photosynthetic pigments, were investigated. Salinity inhibited shoot and root length by 16 and 42%, dry weight by 37 and 23% respectively and negatively affected physiological parameters. Inoculation of unstressed and salt-stressed Indian bassia with B. subtilis significantly improved root and shoot growth, total lipid content, the phospholipid fraction, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b and carotenoid contents) and also increased oleic (C-18:1), linoleic (C-18:2) and linolenic (C-18:3) acids in plant leaves compared to uninoculated plants. The salt-tolerant PGPR, B. subtilis could act synergistically to promote the growth and fitness of Indian bassia plants under salt stress by providing an additional supply of an auxin (IAA) and induce salt stress resistance by reducing stress ethylene levels.",0
"Endophytes are microbes that inhabit host plants without causing disease and are reported to be reservoirs of metabolites that combat microbes and other pathogens. Here we review diverse classes of secondary metabolites, focusing on anti-microbial compounds, synthesized by fungal endophytes including terpenoids, alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, aliphatic compounds, polyketides, and peptides from the interdisciplinary perspectives of biochemistry, genetics, fungal biology, host plant biology, human and plant pathology. Several trends were apparent. First, host plants are often investigated for endophytes when there is prior indigenous knowledge concerning human medicinal uses (e.g., Chinese herbs). However, within their native ecosystems, and where investigated, endophytes were shown to produce compounds that target pathogens of the host plant. In a few examples, both fungal endophytes and their hosts were reported to produce the same compounds. Terpenoids and polyketides are the most purified anti-microbial secondary metabolites from endophytes, while flavonoids and lignans are rare. Examples are provided where fungal genes encoding anti-microbial compounds are clustered on chromosomes. As different genera of fungi can produce the same metabolite, genetic clustering may facilitate sharing of anti-microbial secondary metabolites between fungi. We discuss gaps in the literature and how more interdisciplinary research may lead to new opportunities to develop bio-based commercial products to combat global crop and human pathogens.",0
"Lysinibacillus and Paenibacillus are pervasive bacteria rarely associated with human disease. Less sophisticated microbiology techniques may frequently incorrectly identify these genera as Bacillus spp., often regarded as environmental contamination.

"Enterococci are leading causes of hospital-acquired infection in the United States and continue to develop resistances to new antibiotics. Many Enterococcus faecalis isolates harbor pheromone-responsive plasmids that mediate horizontal transfer of even large blocks of chromosomal genes, resulting in hospital-adapted strains over a quarter of whose genomes consist of mobile elements. Pheromones to which the donor cells respond derive from lipoprotein signal peptides. Using a novel bacterial killing assay dependent on the presence of sex pheromones, we screened a transposon mutant library for functions that relate to the production and/or activity of the effector pheromone. Here we describe a previously uncharacterized, but well-conserved, ABC transporter that contributes to pheromone production. Using three distinct pheromone-dependent mating systems, we show that mutants defective in expressing this transporter display a 5- to 6-order-of-magnitude reduction in conjugation efficiency. In addition, we demonstrate that the ABC transporter mutant displays an altered biofilm architecture, with a significant reduction in biofilm biomass compared to that of its isogenic parent, suggesting that pheromone activity also influences biofilm development. The conservation of this peptide transporter across the Firmicutes suggests that it may also play an important role in cell-cell communication in other species within this important phylum. IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecalis ranks as one of the leading causes of hospital-associated infections. Strains possessing resistance to multiple antibiotics are becoming all too common in clinical settings. Pheromone-responsive plasmids play an important role in harboring and disseminating these antibiotic resistance genes. Here we have identified a novel ABC transporter that is responsible for the secretion of peptide pheromones, which enables communication between cells to mediate plasmid transfer. We have also shown that this transporter is important for biofilm formation, providing a strong rationale for its use as a viable therapeutic target which could be targeted to curb infection, as well as the spread of existing drug resistance.",0
"The thioredoxin (Trx) system, which is composed of NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and thioredoxin, is a key antioxidant system in defense against oxidative stress through its disulfide reductase activity regulating protein dithiol/disulfide balance. The Trx system provides the electrons to thiol-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins) to remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with a fast reaction rate. Trx antioxidant functions are also shown by involvement in DNA and protein repair by reducing ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductases, and regulating the activity of many redox-sensitive transcription factors. Moreover, Trx systems play critical roles in the immune response, virus infection, and cell death via interaction with thioredoxin-interacting protein. In mammalian cells, the cytosolic and mitochondrial Trx systems, in which TrxRs are high molecular weight selenoenzymes, together with the glutathione-glutaredoxin (Grx) system (NADPH, glutathione reductase, GSH, and Grx) control the cellular redox environment. Recently mammalian thioredoxin and glutathione systems have been found to be able to provide the electrons crossly and to serve as a backup system for each other. In contrast, bacteria TrxRs are low molecular weight enzymes with a structure and reaction mechanism distinct from mammalian TrxR. Many bacterial species possess specific thiol-dependent antioxidant systems, and the significance of the Trx system in the defense against oxidative stress is different. Particularly, the absence of a GSH-Grx system in some pathogenic bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Staphylococcus aureus makes the bacterial Trx system essential for survival under oxidative stress. This provides an opportunity to kill these bacteria by targeting the TrxR-Trx system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Three hundred Mn-resistant endophytic bacteria were isolated from the Mn-hyperaccumulator, Phytolacca americana, grown at different levels of Mn (0, 1, and 10 mM) stress. Under no Mn stress, 90%, 92%, and 11% of the bacteria produced indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, respectively. Under Mn stress, 68-94%, 91-92%, and 21-81% of the bacteria produced IAA, siderophore, and ACC deaminase, respectively. Greater percentages of ACC deaminase-producing bacteria were found in the Mn-treated P. americana. Furthermore, the ratios of IAA- and siderophore-producing bacteria were significantly higher in the Mn treated plant leaves, while the ratio of ACC deaminase-producing bacteria was significantly higher in the Mn treated-roots. Based on 165 rRNA gene sequence analysis, Mn-resistant bacteria were affiliated with 10 genera. In experiments involving hybrid penisetum grown in soils treated with 0 and 1000 mg kg(-1) of Mn, inoculation with strain 1Y31 was found to increase the root (ranging from 6.4% to 18.3%) and above-ground tissue (ranging from 19.3% to 70.2%) mass and total Mn uptake of above-ground tissues (64%) compared to the control. Furthermore, inoculation with strain 1Y31 was found to increase the ratio of IAA-producing bacteria in the rhizosphere and bulk soils of hybrid penisetum grown in Mn-added soils. The results showed the effect of Mn stress on the ratio of the plant growth-promoting factor-producing endophytic bacteria of P. americana and highlighted the potential of endophytic bacterium as an inoculum for enhanced phytor-emediation of Mn-polluted soils by hybrid penisetum plants.

"Hybrid wheat plants are superior in yield and growth characteristics compared with their homozygous parents. The commercial production of wheat hybrids is difficult because of the inbreeding nature of wheat and the lack of a practical fertility control that enforces outcrossing. We describe a hybrid wheat system that relies on the expression of a phytotoxic barnase and provides for male sterility. The barnase coding information is divided and distributed at two loci that are located on allelic positions of the host chromosome and are therefore ""linked in repulsion."" Functional complementation of the loci is achieved through coexpression of the barnase fragments and intein-mediated ligation of the barnase protein fragments. This system allows for growth and maintenance of male-sterile female crossing partners, whereas the hybrids are fertile. The technology does not require fertility restorers and is based solely on the genetic modification of the female crossing partner.",0
"The use of 16S rRNA gene sequences for microbial identification in clinical microbiology is accepted widely, and requires databases and algorithms. We compared a new research database containing curated 16S rRNA gene sequences in combination with the LCA (lowest common ancestor) algorithm (RDB-LCA) to a commercially available 16S rDNA Centroid approach. We used 1025 bacterial isolates characterized by biochemistry, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight MS and 16S rDNA sequencing. Nearly 80% of isolates were identified unambiguously at the species level by both classification platforms used. The remaining isolates were mostly identified correctly at the genus level due to the limited resolution of 16S rDNA sequencing. Discrepancies between both 16S rDNA platforms were due to differences in database content and the algorithm used, and could amount to up to 10.5 %. Up to 1.4% of the analyses were found to be inconclusive. It is important to realize that despite the overall good performance of the pipelines for analysis, some inconclusive results remain that require additional in-depth analysis performed using supplementary methods.",0
"The bacterium Paenibacillus larvae has been extensively studied as it is an appalling honey bee pathogen. In the present work, we screened crude extracts derived from fermentations of P. larvae genotypes ERIC I and II for antimicrobial activity, following the detection of four putative secondary metabolite gene clusters that show high sequence homology to known biosynthetic gene clusters for the biosynthesis of antibiotics. Low molecular weight metabolites produced by P. larvae have recently been shown to have toxic effects on honey bee larvae. Moreover, a novel tripeptide, sevadicin, was recently characterized from laboratory cultures of P. larvae. In this study, paenilarvins, which are iturinic lipopeptides exhibiting strong antifungal activities, were obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation from cultures of P. larvae, genotype ERIC II. Their molecular structures were determined by extensive 2D NMR spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry, and other methods. Paenilarvins are the first antifungal secondary metabolites to be identified from P. larvae. In preliminary experiments, these lipopeptides also affected honey bee larvae and might thus play a role in P. larvae survival and pathogenesis. However, further studies are needed to investigate their function.",0
"A new pentacyclic triterpenoid constituent, characterized as 3-oxo-olean-12(13),18(19)-dien-29 alpha-carboxylic acid (1) on the basis of detailed spectral studies, was isolated from the aerial parts and roots of Limnophila indica (Scrophulariaceae). Compound 1 exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive bacteria viz. Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes (MICs within a range of 25-30 mu g/ml) and moderate activity against four Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pantoea ananatis (MICs within a range of 30-100 mu g/ml). The plant pathogenic bacterium P. ananatis and human pathogenic S. typhimurium responded at comparatively higher concentrations of the compound I, which were 75 and 100 mu g/ml respectively. The compound inhibited the growth of Gram-positive B. subtilis and Gram-negative P. aeruginosa completely with a clear bactericidal mode of action at their MIC values. The compound upon treatment on both B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa released substantial amount of nucleic acid in the external medium and also effected the change of morphology towards pleomorphicity, thereby indicating its probable action on cell membrane. Furthermore, the triterpenoid 1 was found not to inhibit a probiotic lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LABW4 under in vitro condition and to possess no toxicity in Swiss albino mice.

"Different solvent extracts of a red algae, Hypnea flagelliformis, and two brown algae, Cystoseira myrica and Sargassum boveanum, which were collected from the Persian Gulf coast were subjected to different bioassays, including: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity by thin layer chromatography (TLC)-bioautography, agar disc diffusion (ADD) and nutrient-broth micro-dilution (NBMD) bioassays. The water extracts were found to have the most antioxidant activity. The antibacterial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the active extracts were determined for the susceptible organisms, Staphylococcus aurous and Bacillus subtilis, using NBMD bioassays. The active substances were identified as free fatty acids (FFA), by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). After derivatization to their methyl esters, their concentrations were measured by using GC-lame ionization detection (GC-FID). In addition to the fatty acids, fucosterol, cholesterol and 22-dehydroxychlosterol were detected as the major sterols in S. boveanum extract using GC-MS analyses.",0
"Fish skin mucus contains several immune substances that provide the first line of defence against a broad spectrum of pathogens although they are poorly studied to date. Terminal carbohydrate composition and levels of total IgM antibodies, several immune-related enzymes (lysozyme, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, esterases, proteases and antiproteases) as well as the bactericidal activity (against fish pathogenic Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio angillarum, Photobacterium damselae and non-pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Shewanella putrefaciens) were identified and measured in the skin mucus of five marine teleosts: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), shi drum (Umbrina cirrosa), common dentex (Dentex dentex) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus). First, lectin binding results suggests that skin mucus contain, in order of abundance, N-acetylneuraminic acid, glucose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and fucose residues. Second, results showed that while some immune activities were very similar in the studied fish (e.g. IgM and lysozyme activity) other such as protease, antiprotease, alkaline phosphatase, esterase and peroxidase activities varied depending on the fish species. High levels of peroxidase and protease activity were found in U. cirrosa respect to the values obtained in the other species while E. marginatus and S. aurata showed the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase and esterase activities, respectively. Moreover, skin mucus of S. aurata revealed higher bactericidal activity against pathogenic bacteria, contrarily, to what happened with non-pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, B. subtilis). Thus, study of the variations in the carbohydrate profile and immune-related components of the fish skin mucus could help to understand the fish resistance as well as the presence and distribution of pathogens and magnitude of infections, aspects that are of major importance for the aquaculture industry.

"In this study, in vitro propagation protocols have been developed through direct and indirect organogenesis from leaf and nodal explant for production of high value of secondary metabolites in Stevia rebaudiana and antimicrobial assay of in vivo and in vitro plant extract. A combination of PGRs proves better than single for both callusing and direct shoot multiplication from leaf explants. Treatment of Kin + IAA (1.5 mg L-1) each showed best callusing response (85.5 +/- 0.33 %). For shoot proliferation, Kin (2.5 mg L-1) with IAA (1.5 mg L-1) showed a maximum number of shoots (5.3 +/- 0.3) proliferating from callus with longest set of 9.03 +/- 0.14 cm and of direct organogenesis and Kin (1.5 mg L-1) with BAP (2.5 mg L-1) gave maximum number (8.6 +/- 0.33) of shoots from leaf explant with longest shoot of 5 +/- 0.11 cm. HPLC profiles showed that both the secondary metabolites (stevioside, 0.451 +/- 0.001 mg g(-1) and Reb A, 0.131 +/- 0.005 mg g(-1)) are higher in in vitro shoots developed through organogenesis from callus. They also proved better in antimicrobial activity with a maximum zone of inhibition against all tested bacteria including B. subtilis (13.6 +/- 0.3 mm), S. aureus (12.3 +/- 0.33 mm), P. fluorescence (8.6 +/- 0.3 mm) and E. coli (10.3 +/- 0.1 mm).",0
"Helminth infection and adverse influence of natural factors cause the development of dysbiosis in young horses in winter. Gut microflora of horses is greatly disturbed after anthelmintics. The use of probiotic from Bacillus subtilis bacterial strains after dehelminthization reduced the number of young horses sick with parascaridosis and raised the content of lactic acid bacteria. Herewith, lactose-negative Escherichia were not detected. The leukocyte content, total protein, and gamma-globulins increased in the blood. These animals showed the highest growth of the live mass.",0
"The conventional antimicrobial technique was based either on poisons or heavy metals, which may not killed the microbes completely, allowing the microbe to survive, change, and become resistant to the poisons and/or heavy metals. Hence, the identification and evaluation of new antimicrobial agents are inevitable. The medicinally important plants, Camellia sinensis (green tea), cuminum cyminum (cumin), Cinnamomum cassia (cinnamon) were taken for the present study. The aqueous extracts of these plants were used in different concentrations (0.5 g, 0.25 g, 0.12 g/2 ml) against four pathogenic strains namely Escherichia coil, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibacterial activities of different extracts were evaluated by well diffusion method. Ampicillin, Ciprofloxacin were used as standard drugs. The aqueous extracts of all three plants showed significant antimicrobial activity against the selected microorganisms when compared to the standard drugs. The green tea showed the maximum zone of inhibition against the organisms used in the present study. Camellia sinensis (Green tea) could be used as an antimicrobial agent against the E. coli, S. aures, B. subtilis and P. aeruginosa.",0
"A comprehensive investigation of chemical constituents from brown algae Stoechospermum marginatum yielded ten known spatane compounds (1-10). To develop the compound libraries on these scaffolds, a series of semi synthetic derivatives was prepared (1a-1d, 2a, 4a, 11 and 12) and investigated for their anti-microbial and anticancer activities. The results indicated that compounds 2a, 4, 1b and 4a exhibited potent cytotoxic activities against B16F10 cancer cell line with IC50 values of 3.28, 3.45, 3.62 and 4.11 mu g/ml respectively, which are comparable to the standard drug (etoposide IC50 = 4.12 mu g/ml). In addition, 4 and 1b were also manifested potent antimicrobial activities against tested bacterial and fungal strains. This is the first Letter on the synthesis and biological activities of these novel derivatives. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Multistable gene regulatory systems sustain different levels of gene expression under identical external conditions. Such multistability is used to encode phenotypic states in processes including nutrient uptake and persistence in bacteria, fate selection in viral infection, cell-cycle control and development. Stochastic switching between different phenotypes can occur as the result of random fluctuations in molecular copy numbers of mRNA and proteins arising in transcription, translation, transport and binding. However, which component of a pathway triggers such a transition is generally not known. By linking single-cell experiments on the lactose-uptake pathway in E. coli to molecular simulations, we devise a general method to pinpoint the particular fluctuation driving phenotype switching and apply this method to the transition between the uninduced and induced states of the lac-genes. We find that the transition to the induced state is not caused only by the single event of lac-repressor unbinding, but depends crucially on the time period over which the repressor remains unbound from the lac-operon. We confirm this notion in strains with a high expression level of the lac-repressor (leading to shorter periods over which the lac-operon remains unbound), which show a reduced switching rate. Our techniques apply to multistable gene regulatory systems in general and allow to identify the molecular mechanisms behind stochastic transitions in gene regulatory circuits.",0
"Wound infections represent a major problem, particularly in patients with chronic wounds. Bacteria in the wound exist mainly in the form of biofilms and are thus resistant to most antibiotics and antimicrobials. A simple and cost-effective in vitro model of chronic wound biofilms applied for testing treatments and solid devices, especially wound dressings, is presented in this work. The method is based on the well-established Lubbock chronic wound biofilm transferred onto an artificial agar wound bed. The biofilm formed by four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was stable for up to 48 h post-transplant. The applicability of the model was evaluated by testing two common iodine wound treatments. These observations indicate that this method enables assessing the effects of treatments on established resilient wound biofilms and is clinically highly relevant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"After the identification and characterization of Cladosporium fulvum [ Passalora fulva] Ecp6, LysM effector genes were found to occur in many fungal species. This thesis describes a functional analysis of LysM effectors that are secreted by various plant pathogenic fungi. In chapter 1, the role of chitin as an important factor in the interaction between fungal pathogens and their plant hosts is discussed. Chapter 2 describes the LysM effectors of three fungal plant pathogens: Slp1 from Magnaporthe oryzae, Mg1LysM and Mg3LysM from Mycosphaerella graminicola and CheLP1 and CheLP2 from Colletotrichum higginsianum. Chapter 3 further investigates how the ability to protect against fungolytic enzymes is established by Mg3LysM. A series of chimeric proteins, in which LysM domains of Mg3LysM were swapped with the corresponding LysM domains of Ecp6, are functionally analysed. In Chapter 4, the LysM effectors of soil-borne vascular pathogen Verticillium dahliae were investigated. In Chapter 5, the hypothesis that LysM effectors play a role in the interaction of fungi with other microbes in the environment is investigated, which could even be relevant for plant pathogenic fungi that encounter other microbes at the sight of host infection. Assays were developed that allow assessing the attachment and antagonistic effects of particular bacterial species on fungi by employing Trichoderma viride. In Chapter 6, the major results described in this thesis are discussed and a perspective on the (potential) roles of LysM in fungi with different lifestyles, including pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic fungi, is presented.",0
"The need for early-on diagnostic tools to assess the folding and solubility of expressed protein constructs in vivo is of great interest when dealing with recalcitrant proteins. In this paper, we took advantage of the picomolar sensitivity of the bipartite GFP1-10/GFP11 system to investigate the solubility of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase PptT, an enzyme essential for the viability of the tubercle bacillus. In vivo and in vitro complementation assays clearly showed the improved solubility of the full-length PptT compared to its N- and C-terminally truncated counterparts. However, initial attempts to purify the full-length enzyme overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells were hampered by aggregation issues overtime that caused the protein to precipitate within hours. The fact that the naturally occurring Coenzyme A and Mg2+, essentials for PptT to carry out its function, could play a role in stabilizing the enzyme was confirmed using DSF experiments. In vitro activity assays were performed using the ACP substrate from the type I polyketide synthase PpsC from M. tuberculosis, a 2188 amino-acid enzyme that plays a major role in the virulence and pathogenicity of this microbial pathogen. We selected the most soluble and compact ACP fragment (2042-2188), identified by genetic selection of in-frame fragments from random library experiments, to monitor the transfer of the P-pant moiety from Coenzyme A onto a conserved serine residue of this ACP domain.

"In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that post-transcriptional control mechanisms are the principal source of gene regulation for a large number of prokaryotic genetic pathways, particularly those involved in virulence and environmental adaptation. Post-transcriptional regulation is largely governed by RNA stability, which itself is determined by target accessibility to RNase degradation. In most Firmicutes species, mRNA stability is strongly impacted by the activity of two recently discovered RNases referred to as RNase J1 and RNase J2. Little is known about RNase J1 function in bacteria and even less is known about RNase J2. In the current study, we mutated both RNase J orthologues in Streptococcus mutans to determine their functional roles in the cell. Single and double RNase J mutants were viable, but grew very slowly on agar plates. All of the mutants shared substantial defects in growth, morphology, acid tolerance, natural competence and biofilm formation. However, most of these defects were more severe in the RNase J2 mutant. Phenotypic suppression results also implicate a role for RNase J2 as a regulator of RNase J1 function. Unlike Bacillus subtilis, RNase J2 is a major pleiotropic regulator in S. mutans, which indicates some fundamental differences from B. subtilis in global gene regulation. Key conserved residues among the RNase J2 orthologues of lactic acid bacteria may hint at a greater role for RNase J2 in these species.",0
"Uses of plants extracts are found to be more advantageous over chemical, physical and microbial (bacterial, fungal, algal) methods for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesis. In phytonanosynthesis, biochemical diversity of plant extract, non-pathogenicity, low cost and flexibility in reaction parameters are accounted for high rate of AgNPs production with different shape, size and applications. At the same time, care has to be taken to select suitable phytofactory for AgNPs synthesis based on certain parameters such as easy availability, large-scale nanosynthesis potential and non-toxic nature of plant extract. This review focuses on synthesis of AgNPs with particular emphasis on biological synthesis using plant extracts. Some points have been given on selection of plant extract for AgNPs synthesis and case studies on AgNPs synthesis using different plant extracts. Reaction parameters contributing to higher yield of nanoparticles are presented here. Synthesis mechanisms and overview of present and future applications of plant-extract-synthesized AgNPs are also discussed here. Limitations associated with use of AgNPs are summarised in the present review.",0
"Adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL), an enzyme involved in purine biosynthesis, has been recognized as a drug target against microbial infections. In the present study, ASL from Mycobacteriumsmegmatis (MsASL) and Mycobacteriumtuberculosis (MtbASL) were cloned, purified and crystallized. The X-ray crystal structure of MsASL was determined at a resolution of 2.16 angstrom. It is the first report of an apo-ASL structure with a partially ordered active site C3 loop. Diffracting crystals of MtbASL could not be obtained and a model for its structure was derived using MsASL as a template. These structures suggest that His149 and either Lys285 or Ser279 of MsASL are the residues most likely to function as the catalytic acid and base, respectively. Most of the active site residues were found to be conserved, with the exception of Ser148 and Gly319 of MsASL. Ser148 is structurally equivalent to a threonine in most other ASLs. Gly319 is replaced by an arginine residue in most ASLs. The two enzymes were catalytically much less active compared to ASLs from other organisms. Arg319Gly substitution and reduced flexibility of the C3 loop might account for the low catalytic activity of mycobacterial ASLs. The low activity is consistent with the slow growth rate of Mycobacteria and their high GC containing genomes, as well as their dependence on other salvage pathways for the supply of purine nucleotides.

"Bacillus megaterium encapsulated in calcium alginate microcapsules was prepared and tested for its efficacy against sheath blight disease of rice. In laboratory conditions, the aqueous suspension (1:100, v/v in potato dextrose agar) of the bacterial microcapsules (10(10) spores/ml) inhibited mycelial growth of Rhizoctonia solani (> 99 %) after the microcapsules were produced and stored for 12 months at room temperature (28 +/- A 2 A degrees C). The survival of the bacterium in the microcapsules in response to ultraviolet (u.v.) irradiation and high temperature was investigated. The survivability of the bacterium in the encapsulated form was greater than that of the fresh cells when it was subjected to u.v. (20-W General electric u.v. lamp from a 25 cm distance for 48 h) and a high temperature treatment (80 A degrees C for 48 h). Cells of the bacterium were detected by scanning electron microscope on both the leaf sheath and the leaf blade (in pot tests in a greenhouse) after spraying encapsulated product. The number of bacteria on the surface of both rice tissues (5 Log. number/g of plant) after spraying with encapsulated product was not significantly different from that after spraying with fresh cells onto the rice seedlings. Spraying the encapsulated B. megaterium on rice plants in the greenhouse was as effective as spraying a chemical fungicide for suppressing rice sheath blight disease.",0
"Caused by the consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing infective metacercariae of Clonorchis sinensis, human clonorchiasis remains a major public health problem in China. In previous study, we had expressed enolase from C. sinensis (CsENO) on the surface of Bacillus subtilis spore and the recombinant spore induced a pronounced protection in terms of reduced worm burden and eggs per gram feces, suggesting B. subtilis spore as an ideal vehicle for antigen delivery by oral treatment and CsENO as a promising vaccine candidate against clonorchiasis. In the current study, we detected CsENO-specific IgG and IgA levels both in serum and in intestinal mucus from rats orally administrated with B. subtilis spore surface expressing CsENO by ELISA. Lysozyme levels in serum and in intestinal mucus were analyzed too. In addition, IgA-secreting cells in intestine epithelium of the rats were detected by immunohistochemistry assay. The intestinal villi lengths of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were also measured. Rats orally treated with B. subtilis spore or normal saline were used as controls. Our results showed that, compared with the control groups, oral administration of B. subtilis spore expressing CsENO induced both systemic and local mucosal immune response. The recombinant spores also enhanced non-specific immune response in rats. The spores had no side effect on liver function. Moreover, it might facilitate food utilization and digestion of the rats. Our work will pave the way to clarify the involved mechanisms of protective efficacy elicited by B. subtilis spore expressing CsENO and encourage us to carry out more assessment trails of the oral treated spore to develop vaccine against clonorchiasis.",0
"Fusarium wilt is one of the most serious diseases of banana plants caused by soil-borne pathogen Fusarium, oxysporum, f.sp. cubense (FOC). In this study a pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of different bio-organic fertilizers (BIOs) on Fusarium wilt of banana, including the investigations of disease incidence, chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase activities of banana plants, and FOC populations as well as soil rhizosphere microbial community. Five fertilization treatments were considered, including chemical fertilizer containing the same N, P and K concentrations as the BIO (control), and matured compost mixed with antagonists Paenibacillus polymyxa SQR-21 and Trichoderma harzianum T37 (BIO1), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens N6 (BIO2), Bacillus subtilis N11 (BIO3), and the combination of N6 and Nil (BI04). The results indicated that the application of BIOs significantly decreased the incidence rate of Fusarium wilt by up to 80% compared with the control. BIOs also significantly promoted plant growth, and increased chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase activities by 55%-65% and 17.3%-120.1%, respectively, in the banana roots. The population of FOG in the rhizosphere soil was decreased significantly to about 104 colony forming units g(-1) with treatment of BIOs. Serial dilution plating and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the application of BIOs increased the densities of bacteria 4nd actinomycetes but decreased the number of fungi in the rhizosphere soil. In general, the application of BIOs revealed a great potential for the control of Fusarium wilt disease of banana plants.",0
"In this study, we investigated the impact of the cell membrane composition of E. faecalis on its recognition by the host immune system. To this end, we employed an E. faecalis deletion mutant (Delta bgsA) that does not synthesize the major cell membrane glycolipid diglycosyl-diacylglycerol (DGlcDAG). Proteomic analysis revealed that 13 of a total of 21 upregulated surface-associated proteins of E. faecalis Delta bgsA were lipoproteins. This led to a total lipoprotein content in the cell membrane of 35.8% in Delta bgsA compared to only 9.4% in wildtype bacteria. Increased lipoprotein content strongly affected the recognition of Delta bgsA by mouse macrophages in vitro with an increased stimulation of TNF-alpha production by heat-fixed bacteria and secreted antigens. Inactivation of the prolipoprotein diacylglycerol transferase (lgt) in Delta bgsA abrogated TNF-alpha induction by a Delta bgsA_lgt double mutant indicating that lipoproteins mediate increased activation of mouse macrophages by Delta bgsA. Heatfixed Delta bgsA bacteria, culture supernatant, or cell membrane lipid extract activated transfected HEK cells in a TLR2-dependent fashion; the same was not true of wild-type bacteria. In mice infected intraperitoneally with a sublethal dose of E. faecalis we observed a 70% greater mortality in mice infected with Delta bgsA compared with wild-type-infected mice. Increased mortality due to Delta bgsA infection was associated with elevated plasma levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MIP-2. In summary, our results provide evidence that an E. faecalis mutant lacking its major bilayer forming glycolipid DGlcDAG upregulates lipoprotein expression leading to increased activation of the host innate immune system and virulence in vivo.",0
"Sensing of and responding to environmental changes are of vital importance for microbial cells. Consequently, bacteria have evolved a plethora of signaling systems that usually sense biochemical cues either via direct ligand binding, thereby acting as ""concentration sensors,"" or by responding to downstream effects on bacterial physiology, such as structural damage to the cell. Here, we describe a novel, alternative signaling mechanism that effectively implements a "" flux sensor"" to regulate antibiotic resistance. It relies on a sensory complex consisting of a histidine kinase and an ABC transporter, in which the transporter fulfills the dual role of both the sensor of the antibiotic and the mediator of resistance against it. Combining systems biological modeling with in vivo experimentation, we show that these systems in fact respond to changes in activity of individual resistance transporters rather than to changes in the antibiotic concentration. Our model shows that the cell thereby adjusts the rate of de novo transporter synthesis to precisely the level needed for protection. Such a flux-sensing mechanism may serve as a cost-efficient produce-to-demand strategy, controlling a widely conserved class of antibiotic resistance systems. IMPORTANCE Bacteria have to be able to accurately perceive their environment to allow adaptation to changing conditions. This is usually accomplished by sensing the concentrations of beneficial or harmful substances or by measuring the effect of the prevailing conditions on the cell. Here we show the existence of a new way of sensing the environment, where the bacteria monitor the activity of an antibiotic resistance transporter. Such a ""flux-sensing"" mechanism allows the cell to detect its current capacity to deal with the antibiotic challenge and thus precisely respond to the need for more transporters. We propose that this is a cost-efficient way of regulating antibiotic resistance on demand.",0
"Bacteriocins are attracting increased attention as an alternative to classic antibiotics in the fight against infectious disease and multidrug resistant pathogens. Bacillus subtilis strain MMA7 isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans displays a broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, which includes Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, as well as several pathogenic Candida species. This activity is in part associated with a newly identified lantibiotic, herein named as subtilomycin. The proposed biosynthetic cluster is composed of six genes, including protein-coding genes for LanB-like dehydratase and LanC-like cyclase modification enzymes, characteristic of the class I lantibiotics. The subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster in B. subtilis strain MMA7 is found in place of the sporulation killing factor (skf) operon, reported in many B. subtilis isolates and involved in a bacterial cannibalistic behaviour intended to delay sporulation. The presence of the subtilomycin biosynthetic cluster appears to be widespread amongst B. subtilis strains isolated from different shallow and deep water marine sponges. Subtilomycin possesses several desirable industrial and pharmaceutical physicochemical properties, including activity over a wide pH range, thermal resistance and water solubility. Additionally, the production of the lantibiotic subtilomycin could be a desirable property should B. subtilis strain MMA7 be employed as a probiotic in aquaculture applications.",0
"The rhizobacterial strain Jdm2 was isolated from the rhizosphere of the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Trichosanthes kirilowii in Jiangsu province, China, and was identified as Bacillus subtilis. Exposure of cell-free filtrate of the strain to the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita under in vitro conditions caused substantial mortality of the second stage juvenile (J2) and significantly reduced egg hatchability. A greenhouse trial demonstrated that 56 days after treatment with Jdm2, the number of galls associated with M. incognita infection in the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots was significantly reduced compared to controls, and the disease severity of infected plants was lower in treated plants (36%) compared to water control (75%). Consistently, in the field trial, the biocontrol efficacy of Jdm2 reached 69%, 51% and 48% after 30, 60 and 90 days post-transplantation, respectively. As indicated by PCR-DGGE analysis, inoculation with Jdm2 strain had an effect on the bacterial community of the tomato rhizosphere at the first stage, but was not able to imperil the bacterial community stability for long time. The novel bacterial strain Jdm2 enhances plant growth and inhibits nematode activity, and has the potential to be a safe and effective microbial pesticide.",0
"Bioefficacy of talc-based formulation of Bacillus megaterium strain NBAII 63 was evaluated through different methods of applications in the field trials for suppression of bacterial wilt in brinjal (Solanum melongena) incited by Ralstonia solanacearum and plant growth promotion. The efficacy of the talc formulation of the antagonist was evaluated as seed treatment ((4g kg (1)), soil application (2.5kg ha (1)), seedling root dip (10g L (1)) and foliar spray(10g L (1)) individually as well as in different combinations. The lowest wilt incidence (17.3 %) was recorded when all the four treatments were combined and this was significantly superior over control where 55.1% of wilt incidence was observed. Reduction in wilt incidence up to 68.6% under field conditions were recorded in the combined application. Highest rhizosphere population of antagonistic bacteria 76.5 x 10(6) cfu g (1) was also recorded at 40 d after transplanting when the antagonist was applied as a combination of seed treatment, seedling root dip, soil application and foliar spray.",0
"Background: Clostridium difficile spores and multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, are important nosocomial pathogens that are difficult to eliminate from the hospital environment. We evaluated the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), a no-touch automated room decontamination system, for the inactivation of a range of pathogens dried onto hard nonporous and porous surfaces in an operating room (OR). Methods: Stainless steel and cotton carriers containing >4 log(10) viable MRSA, VRE, or MDR A baumannii were placed at 4 locations in the OR along with 7 pouched 6 log(10) Geobacillus stearothermophilus spore biologic indicators (BIs). HPV was then used to decontaminate the OR. The experiment was repeated 3 times. Results: HPV inactivated all spore BIs (>6 log(10) reduction), and no MRSA, VRE, or MDR A baumannii were recovered from the stainless steel and cotton carriers (>4-5 log(10) reduction, depending on the starting inoculum). HPV was equally effective at all carrier locations. We did not identify any difference in efficacy for microbes dried onto stainless steel or cotton surfaces, indicating that HPV may have a role in the decontamination of both porous and nonporous surfaces. Conclusion: HPV is an effective way to decontaminate clinical areas where contamination with bacterial spores and MDR organisms is suspected.

"Background: We previously identified an ECF sigma factor, sigma(S), that is important in the stress and virulence response of Staphylococcus aureus. Transcriptional profiling of sigS revealed that it is differentially expressed in many laboratory and clinical isolates, suggesting the existence of regulatory networks that modulates its expression. Results: To identify regulators of sigS, we performed a pull down assay using S. aureus lysates and the sigS promoter. Through this we identified CymR as a negative effector of sigS expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed that CymR directly binds to the sigS promoter and negatively effects transcription. To more globally explore genetic regulation of sigS, a Tn551 transposon screen was performed, and identified insertions in genes that are involved in amino acid biosynthesis, DNA replication, recombination and repair pathways, and transcriptional regulators. In efforts to identify gain of function mutations, methyl nitro-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis was performed on a sigS-lacZ reporter fusion strain. From this a number of clones displaying sigS upregulation were subject to whole genome sequencing, leading to the identification of the lactose phosphotransferase repressor, lacR, and the membrane histidine kinase, kdpD, as central regulators of sigS expression. Again using EMSAs we determined that LacR is an indirect regulator of sigS expression, while the response regulator, KdpE, directly binds to the promoter region of sigS. Conclusions: Collectively, our work suggests a complex regulatory network exists in S. aureus that modulates expression of the ECF sigma factor, sS.",0
"Backgroud: Strychnos lucida R. Br. (Loganiaceae), a well-known indigenous medicine in Timor Leste, has been used for the treatment of ailments such as malaria, diarrhoea, fever, hypertension, cancer, diabetes mellitus and skin infections. Its pharmacological activity has never been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the biological activities of S. lucida, including antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. Materials and methods: The stem, stem bark, twig and leaves of S. lucida were extracted by non-polar (hexane) and polar (ethyl acetate and methanol) solvents. Antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts against 29 microorganisms was evaluated using the agar dilution method and antioxidant properties were determined using DPPH and SOD assays. Anticancer activity was investigated against HepG2, HuCCA-1, A549 and MOLT-3 cell lines using the MTT and XTT assays. Results: It was found that the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of S. lucida selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus and Streptococcus pyogenes) with MICs range of 32-128 mu g/mL. Antioxidant activities, radical and superoxide scavenging properties, were observed for ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of S. lucida. Particularly, the ethyl acetate extracts selectively showed inhibitory activity against MOLT-3 cells. Notably, the plant extracts showed the relationship between antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. Conclusion: The findings support the medicinal usage of S. lucida.",0
"Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) are originated from cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, including Alexandrium tamarense, the common dinoflagellate species. In this study, a toxic dinoflagellate strain of A. tamarense CI01 was selected for studying the PSTs' concentration and the related protein variation during the whole cell cycle under different nutrient conditions. High-performance liquid chromatography, 2-D DIGE and Western blotting were used collectively for protein profiling and identification. Results showed that the toxin content was suppressed under nitrogen limiting condition, but enhanced in phosphorous limiting medium. Based on the results of proteomics analysis, 7 proteins were discovered to be related to the PSTs biosynthesis of A. tamarense CI01, including S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, ornithine cyclodeaminase, argininosuccinate synthase, methyluridine methyltransferase cystine ABC transporter, phosphoserine phosphatase, argininosuccinate synthase and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which corresponds to the metabolism of the methionine, cysteine, ornithine, arginine and proline. Moreover, some photosynthesis relating proteins also increased their expression during PST synthesis period in A. tamarense CI01, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase, peridininchlorophyll alpha-binding protein, Mg2+ transporter protein and chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase. The above findings are in support of our hypothesis that these proteins are involved in toxin biosynthesis of A. tamarense CI01, but cause-and-effect mechanisms need to be investigated in further studies.",0
"In vitro antibacterial activity of 16 essential oils was investigated by disc diffusion method against two Gram positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and two Gram negative bacteria, Shigella flexneri and Escherichia coli. Oils of Cymbopogon citratus and Ocimum basilicum showed highest antibacterial activity. Gram positive bacteria were found to be more sensitive than Gram negative. Antioxidant activities were tested by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and ABTS radical cation decolourization assay while Folin-Ciocalteu method was used to determine the total phenolic content. In DPPH assay, highest antioxidant activity was observed in O. basilicum oil followed by Azeratum conyzoides, A. marmelos and C. citratus, with percent inhibition and IC50 value ranging from 66.11-71.93% and 14.10-17.92 mu l ml(-1) respectively. In ABTS assay, similar results were obtained but with higher percent inhibition which ranged from 67.48-76.23% and lower IC50 value (12.12-17.21 mu l ml(-1)). Moreover, radical scavenging activity of essential oils was lower than that observed for the synthetic antioxidant BHA and BHT. The total phenolic content of the essential oils as GAE in mg 100 mu l(-1) of EO was found to be highest in O. basilicum (0.406) oil followed by A. conyzoides (0.322), A. marmelos (0.238) and C. citratus (0.231). The results provide evidence that the oils of C. citratus and O. basilicum can be further recommended for treatment of infections caused by these bacterial pathogens and are potential source of natural antioxidants having appreciable amount of total phenolic content.",0
"Treating infections with exogenous NO, which shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, appears to be effective. Similar to NO biosynthesis, biosynthesis of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein variant A (AGPa), with a reduced cysteine (Cys149), increases markedly during inflammation and infection. We hypothesized that AGPa is an S-nitrosation target in acute-phase proteins. This study aimed to determine whether S-nitrosated AGPa (SNO-AGPa) may be the first compound of this novel antibacterial class against multidrug-resistant bacteria. AGPa was incubated with RAW264.7 cells activated by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma. The antimicrobial effects of SNO-AGPa were determined by measuring the turbidity of the bacterial suspensions in vitro and survival in a murine sepsis model in vivo, respectively. Results indicated that endogenous NO generated by activated RAW264.7 cells caused S-nitrosation of AGPa at Cys149. SNO-AGPa strongly inhibited growth of gram-positive, gram-negative, and multidrug-resistant bacteria and was an extremely potent bacteriostatic compound (IC50: 10(-9) to 10(-6) M). The antibacterial mechanism of SNO-AGPa involves S-transnitrosation from SNO-AGPa to bacterial cells. Treatment with SNO-AGPa, but not with AGPa, markedly reduced bacterial counts in blood and liver in a mouse sepsis model. The sialyl residues of AGPa seem to suppress the antibacterial activity, since SNO-asialo AGPa was more potent than SNO-AGPa.-Watanabe, K., Ishima, Y., Akaike, T., Sawa, T., Kuroda, T., Ogawa, W., Watanabe, H., Suenaga, A., Kai, T., Otagiri, M., Maruyama, T.

"The sal lantibiotic locus plays an important role in the virulence of Streptococcus pyogenes. Our transcriptional analysis of the sal locus provides new information on the complex regulation of this operon. Transcription of the operon is regulated by a promoter upstream of the operon and by a second internal promoter upstream of the salKRZ genes. Here we identify the location of the internal promoter and provide information on how this promoter is autoregulated by proteins within the locus. We determined by primer extension that the salKR promoter is located within the salY gene and identified several regulatory regions important for expression. The higher activity of the promoter in a salKR deletion strain indicates a role in repression by the SalR response regulator. Further, this promoter had higher activity in a salA deletion strain, implicating corepression or a signaling role for the SalA peptide. Finally, we demonstrate that this promoter can be controlled by host factors. Analysis of transcriptional regulation of this locus provides a better understanding of the function of the sal locus in S. pyogenes pathogenesis.",0
"Two novel vicinal dioxime ligands containing (4-methoxybenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone glyoxime ((LH2)-H-1) or 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone glyoxime ((LH2)-H-2)) thiosemicarbazone units were synthesized and characterized using H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, HMQC, MS, infrared and, UV-VIS. spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Mononuclear nickel(II), copper(II) and cobalt(II) complexes with a metal:ligand ratio of 1:2 for (LH2)-H-1 and (LH2)-H-2 were also synthesized. The effect of pH and solvent on the absorption spectra of both ligands and complexes was determined. IR spectra show that the ligands act in a bidentate manner and coordinates N-4 donor groups of the ligands to Ni-II, Cu-II and Co-II ions. The detection of H-bonding (O-H center dot center dot center dot O) in the [M(LH)(2)] metal complexes by IR spectra supported the square-planar MN4 coordination of mononuclear complexes. The antimicrobial activities of compounds (LH2)-H-1, (LH2)-H-2, and their Ni(II), Cu(II) and Co(II) complexes were evaluated using the disc diffusion method against 12 bacteria and 4 yeasts. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against 7 bacteria and 3 yeasts were also determined. Among the test compounds attempted, (LH2)-H-1, [Ni((LH)-H-1)(2)], [Cu((LH)-H-1)(2)], (LH2)-H-2, [Ni(L2H)(2)] and [Cu((LH)-H-2)(2)] showed some activities against certain Gram-positive bacteria and some of the yeasts tested.

"Identification of unwanted microbial contaminants microscopically observed in food products is challenging due to their low abundance in a complex matrix, quite often containing other microorganisms. Therefore, a selective identification method was developed using laser capture microdissection in combination with direct-captured cell PCR. This procedure was validated with Geobacillus stearothermophilus and further used to identify microbial contaminants present in some industrial milk samples. The microscopically observed contaminants were identified as mainly Methylobacterium species.",0
"The increase of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) poses a worldwide and serious health threat. Although new antibiotics, such as daptomycin and linezolid, have been developed for the treatment of infections of Gram-positive pathogens, the emergence of daptomycin-resistant and linezolid-resistant strains during therapy has now increased clinical treatment failures. In the past few years, studies using quantitative proteomic methods have provided a considerable progress in understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms. In this review, to understand the resistance mechanisms to four clinically important antibiotics (methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin) used in the treatment of Gram-positive pathogens, we summarize recent advances in studies on resistance mechanisms using quantitative proteomic methods, and also examine proteins playing an important role in the bacterial mechanisms of resistance to the four antibiotics. Proteomic researches can identify proteins whose expression levels are changed in the resistance mechanism to only one antibiotic, such as LiaH in daptomycin resistance and PrsA in vancomycin resistance, and many proteins simultaneously involved in resistance mechanisms to various antibiotics. Most of resistance-related proteins, which are simultaneously associated with resistance mechanisms to several antibiotics, play important roles in regulating bacterial envelope biogenesis, or compensating for the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, proteomic data confirm that antibiotic resistance requires the fitness cost and the bacterial envelope is an important factor in antibiotic resistance.",0
"Poly(cyanurateamine) and poly(triacrylatetrimine) hyperbranched polymers were synthesized for the first time by adopting Michael addition reaction. These polymers were obtained by reacting diethylenetriamine (A(2)) with 2,4,6-triallylcyanurate (B-3) and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (B-3), respectively, at room temperature. The polymers were characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier transform infrared, 1H-, and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity of hyperbranched polymers was studied against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli, Bacillus firmus, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2423, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus sp., and Acinetobacter beijerinckii. Both poly(cyanurateamine) and poly(triacrylatetrimine) show good antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria compared to gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, poly(triacrylatetrimine) is better resistant to promising antibiotics and antiseptics bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens in comparison with poly(cyanurateamine).",0
"Citrus canker, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xac), is one of the most devastating diseases to affect citrus crops. There is no treatment for citrus canker; effective control against the spread of Xac is usually achieved by the elimination of affected plants along with that of asymptomatic neighbors. An in depth understanding of the pathogen is the keystone for understanding of the disease; to this effect we are committed to the development of strategies to ease the study of Xac. Genome sequencing and annotation of Xac revealed that similar to 37% of the genome is composed of hypothetical ORFs. To start a systematic characterization of novel factors encoded by Xac, we constructed integrative-vectors for protein expression specific to this bacterium. The vectors allow for the production of TAP-tagged proteins in Xac under the regulation of the xylose promoter. In this study, we show that a TAP-expression vector, integrated into the amy locus of Xac, does not compromise its virulence. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that the polypeptide TAP can be overproduced in Xac and purified from the soluble phase of cell extracts. Our results substantiate the use of our vectors for protein expression in Xac thus contributing a novel tool for the characterization of proteins and protein complexes generated by this bacterium in vivo.

"Programmed cell death in bacteria is generally associated with two-component toxin-antitoxin systems. The SpollS toxin-antitoxin system, consisting of a membrane-bound SpollSA toxin and a small, cytosolic antitoxin SpollSB, was originally identified in Bacillus subtilis. In this work we describe the Bacillus cereus SpollS system which is a three-component system, harboring an additional gene spollSC. Its protein product serves as an antitoxin, and similarly as SpollSB, is able to bind SpolISA and abolish its toxic effect. Our results indicate that SpollSC seems to be present not only in B. cereus but also in other Bacilli containing a SpollS toxin-antitoxin system. In addition, we show that B. cereus SpolISA can form higher oligomers and we discuss the possible role of this multimerization for the protein's toxic function.",0
"Betaine uptake in Listeria monocytogenes is mediated by three independent transport systems, the simplest of which in genetic terms is the secondary transporter BetL. Using a random mutagenesis approach, based on the E. coli XL1 Red mutator strain, we identified a single point mutation in a putative promoter region upstream of the BetL coding region which leads to a significant increase in betL transcript levels under osmo- and chill-stress conditions and a concomitant increase in stress tolerance. Furthermore, the mutation appears to counter the heretofore unreported ""twisted"" cell morphology observed for L. monocytogenes grown at elevated osmolarities in tryptone soy broth.",0
"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), which are evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors from insects to mammals, recognize bacterial PGN and function in antibacterial innate immunity. The existence of alternative splicing is a common feature for PGRP family. Here the splicing pattern from the splicing at the 5' end of PGRP6 gene was identified in a teleost fish, the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Four splice variants of grass carp PGRP6 were designated as gcPGRP6a, gcPGRP6b, gcPGRP6c and gcPGRP6d, respectively. Real-time PCR revealed the different expression of these variants in fish individuals and CIK cell line in response to stimulation with different microbial ligands. Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting showed that the splice variants are intracellular protein. Cell lysates from Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells transfected with gcPGRP6 splice variants are able to bind microbial PAMPs including Lys-type PGN from Staphylococcus aureus, DAP-type PGN from Bacillus subtilis, glucan, mannan, and microorganisms including Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Flavobacterium columnare and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, overexpression of gcPGRP6 variants inhibited earlier stage growth of intracellular bacteria. The data also identified a specific role for gcPGRP6c variant in the positive regulation of cytolytic molecule perforin, and for gcPGRP6a, gcPGRP6b and gcPGRP6c variants in positive regulation of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). However, the gcPGRP6d variant, which encoded basically only the PGRP domain, failed to induce the expression of perforin and AMPs. It is suggested that fish PGRP6 splice variants have common and variant-specific function in innate immune response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Sinaloa state accounts for 23% of Mexico's tomato production. One constraint on this important crop is the Fusarium crown and root rot, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, which has been reported to reduce crop yield by up to 50%. In this study, we set out to identify bacterial populations which could be used to control this disease through natural antagonism. Five tomato rhizospheric soil samples were collected, dried for 1-week, and homogenized. Sub-samples were used to prepare an aqueous solution used to isolate microorganisms in pure cultures. Organisms were purified and grown separately, and used to generate a collection of 705 bacterial isolates. Thirty-four percent from this bank (254 strains) was screened against Forl, finding 27 bacteria displaying in vitro Forl growth inhibition levels from 5% to 60%. These isolates belonged to the genus Bacillus and their 16Sr DNA sequences showed that they are closely related to seven species and they were putatively designated as: B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, B. thuringiensis, B. megaterium, and B. pumilus. One isolate belonged to the genus Acinetobacter. Two B. subtilis isolates (144 and 151) and one B. cereus isolate (171) showed the best antagonistic potential against FCRRT when evaluated on seedlings. Plate and activity assays indicate that these isolates include a diverse repertoire of functional antagonistic traits that might explain their ability to control FCRRT. Moreover, bacteria showed partial hemolytic activity, and future research will be directed at ensuring that their application will be not harmful for humans and effective against Forl in greenhouse or field conditions.",0
"Nine new spirobisnaphthalenes, palmarumycins B-1-B-9 (1-9), along with 13 known compounds (10-22), were isolated from cultures of the fungus Berkleasmium sp., an endophyte isolated from the medicinal plant Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by analysis of the 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS spectra and by comparison with known compounds. Compounds 7-9 contain an uncommon 2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one unit. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus hemolyticus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas lachrymans, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Xanthomonas vesicatoria and for their antifungal effects against the spore germination of Magnaporthe oryzae. Palmarumycin C-8 (22) exhibited the best antibacterial and antifungal effects. In addition, diepoxin d (11) and palmarumycin C8 (22) showed pronounced cytotoxic activities against five human cancer cell lines (HCT-8, Bel-7402, BGC-823, A 549, A 2780) with IC50 values of 1.28-5.83 mu M.",0
"During sporulation, Bacillus subtilis divides around the nucleoid near one cell pole, initially capturing approximately one quarter of one chromosome in the newly formed forespore compartment. While it is known that a specific region of the nucleoid is reproducibly captured in the forespore, the mechanism underlying the precision of capture is unknown. Here we describe a role for RefZ, a DNA-binding protein that regulates FtsZ, and its cognate binding motifs (RBMs) in defining the specific region of chromosome initially captured in the forespore. RefZ is conserved across the Bacillus genus and remains functional as an inhibitor of cell division in a species-swapping experiment. The RBMs are also conserved in their positioning relative to oriC across Bacillus, suggesting that the function of the RBMs is both important and position-dependent in the genus. In B. subtilis, the RBMs flank the region of the chromosome captured at the time of cell division, and we find that RefZ binds the five oriC-proximal RBMs with similar apparent affinity in units of two and four. refZ and RBM mutants capture chromosomal regions normally excluded from the forespore, suggesting that RefZ-RBM complexes play a role in regulating the position of cell division relative to the chromosome during sporulation.",0
"AimsTo analyse the essentiality of the ROM2 genes originating from the pathogenic yeasts Candida glabrata and Candida albicans by using temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants. Methods and ResultsBased on the general concepts that ts mutations are generated by virtue of point mutation within essential genes, we have previously established a novel method (termed ETS system' for screening and identification of essential genes using ts mutants of C.glabrata). According to this ETS system, the present study successfully identified a putative C.glabrata ROM2 homologue as an essential gene that complements its point mutation (Cys-1275/Tyr substitution). The C.albicans ROM2 mutant (Cys-1281/Tyr), constructed patterned after this point mutation, also displayed ts phenotype. Both ts mutants recovered colony-forming ability, with concomitant suppression of lysis phenotype, at the elevated temperature in the presence of 1moll(-1) sorbitol as an osmotic stabilizer. Sequence alignment revealed that human genome possesses relatively low homology against Rom2 homologues, which are highly conserved among yeast species. ConclusionsROM2 genes of C.glabrata and C.albicans are essential for viability, probably involved in cell wall integrity. Significance and Impact of the StudyROM2 genes essential for both Candida species may be a potentially useful antifungal targets from chemotherapeutic viewpoint.",0
"Novel 3-elongated arylalkoxybenzamide derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their cell division inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity. Among them, the subseries of 3-alkyloxybenzamide derivatives exhibited greatly improved on-target activity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and remarkably increased antibacterial activity against B. subtilis ATCC9372, penicillin-susceptible S. aureus ATCC25923, methicillin-resistant S. aureus ATCC29213 (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant S. aureus PR compared with 3-methoxybenzamide. In contrast, the subseries of 3-phenoxyaklyloxybenzamide, 3-heteroarylalkyloxybenzamide and 3-heteroarylthioalkyloxybenzamide derivatives only showed a significant improvement in on-target activity and antibacterial activity against B. subtilis ATCC9372.

"DNA acquisition promotes the spread of resistance to antibiotics and virulence among bacteria. It is also linked to several natural phenomena including recombination, genome dynamics, adaptation and speciation. Horizontal DNA transfer between bacteria occurs via conjugation, transduction or competence for natural transformation by DNA uptake. Among these, competence is the only mechanism of transformation initiated and entirely controlled by the chromosome of the recipient bacteria. While the molecular mechanisms allowing the uptake of extracellular DNA are increasingly characterized, the function of competence for natural transformation by DNA uptake, the selective advantage maintaining it and the reasons why bacteria take up DNA in the first place are still debated. In this synthesis, I review some of the literature and discuss the four hypotheses on how and why do bacteria take up DNA. I argue that DNA uptake by bacteria is an accidental by-product of bacterial adhesion and twitching motility. Adhesion and motility are generally increased in stressful conditions, which may explain why bacteria increase DNA uptake in these conditions. In addition to its fundamental scientific relevance, the new hypothesis suggested here has significant clinical implications and finds further support from the fact that antibiotics sometimes fail to eliminate the targeted bacterium while inevitably causing stress to others. The widespread misuse of antibiotics may thus not only be selecting for resistant strains, but may also be causing bacteria to take up more DNA with the consequent increase in the chances of acquiring drug resistance and virulence-a scenario in full concordance with the previously reported induction of competence genes by antibiotics in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.",0
"Introduction: In recent years, Clostridium difficile has become the primary cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, resulting in long and complicated hospital stays that represent a serious burden for patients as well as health care systems. Currently, conservative treatment of C. difficile infection (CDI) relies on the antibiotics vancomycin, metronidazole or fidaxomicin, or in case of multiple recurrences, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).Areas covered: The fast-spreading, epidemic nature of this pathogen urgently necessitates the search for alternative treatment strategies as well as antibiotic targets. Accordingly, in this review, we highlight the recent findings regarding virulence associated traits of C. difficile, evaluate their potential as alternative drug targets, and present current efforts in designing inhibitory compounds, with the aim of pointing out possibilities for future treatment strategies.Expert opinion: Increased attention on systematic analysis of the virulence mechanisms of C. difficile has already led to the identification of several alternative drug targets. In the future, applying state of the art omics' and the development of novel infection models that mimic the human gut, a highly complex ecological niche, will unveil the genomic and metabolic plasticity of this pathogen and will certainly help dealing with future challenges.",0
"Regioselective synthesis of a number of highly functionalized 3-benzylpyrimidino chromen-2-ones (4) were accomplished in a one pot three component reaction in acetic acid and determined their anti-microbial and anti-biofilm activities.

"This study was undertaken to evaluate the antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of the ethanolic extracts of the leaves of Euphorbia hirta. The antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of the ethanolic extracts of the leaves of Euphorbia hirta were determined using the in-vitro methods. Its antioxidant effect was determined by evaluating its ferric reducing ability and its scavenging effects on some free radicals such as; 2,2 diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, and nitric oxide (NO) radicals. Its total phenol content was also determined at 1, 2, 3 mg/ml. The antimicrobial effects was determined by evaluating its inhibitory effects against some microorganisms like Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Enterococcus feacalis, Klebsilla pneumonia, Proteus maribalis and Shigella dysenteri. Its inhibitory effect was also compared with some standard antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, gentamicin and amoxicillin. The result shows a concentration dependent increase in the activity of the extract against the radicals. The ethanolic extracts of the leaves of Euphorbia hirta exhibited a reasonable inhibitory effects against all the microorganisms tested with its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 0.8 mg/ml. Comparing with the standard antibiotics, It shows a wider zone of inhibition against some microorganisms than the standard antibiotics which was more pronounced against Proteus maribalis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. This study demonstrated the significant free radical scavenging and antimicrobial potential of the leaves of Euphorbia hirta and could be explored for treatment of various infections caused by these microorganisms and also in the treatment of free radicals mediated aliments.",0
"Objective(s): We aimed to characterize the phenotype and genotype of Bacillus spp isolated from diabetic patients' eyes, by studying the drug sensitivity patterns with a disc-diffusion method. Materials and Methods: Fifty eyes of 25 patients with type II diabetes mellitus, with at least 10 years of diabetes history, were included in the study. We analyzed the eyes for the presence of Bacillus spp.; presumptive isolates were identified by morphological, and biochemical tests, and confirmed by the VITEK system. Automated EcoRI ribotyping was performed with a RiboPrinter (R) Microbial Characterization System. We determined the antibiotic resistance of the isolates by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test. Results: Seven out of 25 patients were on insulin treatment; 7 on oral anti-diabetic medication; and 11 on combination therapy of insulin and oral medications. Among the 28 Bacillus spp isolates, 14 were B. cereus, 11 were B. pumilus, 2 were B. mojavensis and 1 was B. subtilis. Almost all the strains were either resistant or multiresistant, particularly towards cefuroxime, methicillin, and ceftazidime. Conclusion: Diabetic patients seem to be more prone to B. cereus infections than healthy individuals. It would be greatly beneficial to understand and recognize the prevalence of microorganisms and their resistance patterns for better outcome in ocular surgeries.",1
"A screening of sporiferous fungicide-producing bacteria has permitted to select a 16-K11 strain that according to the data of the 16S RNA variable segments analysis was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Cultural, morphological and physiologobiochemical characteristics of the strain were investigated, and the dynamics of the fungicidal factor(s) synthesis was determined. The location of the fungicidal activity in the culture fluid was confirmed. The fungicidal factor is resistant to proteolytic enzymes. It displays a pronounced activity against the conventional causes of grain crops fusariosis, Fusarium avenaceum, F. graminearum and F. sporotrichioides. The 16-K11 strain CL was shown to be nontoxic for plants.",0
"Plant inoculation with formulations of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM) can be a sustainable technique for the improvement of tomato yield and plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Combination of artificial plant mycorrhization with water deficit irrigation could be an effective agronomical technique for the optimization of water use efficiency of tomato in the areas with a limited water availability. A 2-year research on field tomato was undertaken in Southern Italy (40 degrees 24'N; 16 degrees 48'E; 10 m a.s.l.) to evaluate the effects on crop growth, yield, and fruit quality of the combination of seedling inoculation with two VAM formulations, alone or integrated with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), with different irrigation regimes (restoration of 0%, 50%, and 100% of maximum crop evapotranspiration). A split-plot experimental design with three reps was followed, with irrigation regimes in the main plots and mycorrhizal treatments in the subplots. Both VAM treatments, either with or without PGPR, demonstrated to be highly and rapidly effective on plant growth, as significantly increasing growth of tomato seedlings and plant biomass at mid and end of both crops compared to the non-inoculated control. Positive effects of mycorrhizal inoculation were extended also to marketable yield, mainly as a result of an increased number and weight of fruits. Both VAM inocula did not significantly affect fruit quality parameters, though increased water use efficiency of marketable yield. Both irrigation regimes positively affected tomato growth and marketable yield, whereas the fruit quality was better in less- and non-watered plants. Adversely to expectations, no synergism was found between artificial mycorrhization and irrigation regimes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Currently, more antimicrobial drug candidates are urgently needed to combat the rise in drug-resistance among pathogenic microbes. A new antimicrobial peptide, MP1102, a variant of NZ2114, was designed, evaluated, and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. The total secreted protein in cultures reached 695 mg/l, and the concentration of the recombinant MP1102 (rMP1102) was 292 mg/l. rMP1102 was purified from the fermentation supernatant by one-step cation exchange chromatography to obtain a yield of 197.1 mg/l with 96.4 % purity. rMP1102 exhibited potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for four Staphyloccocus aureus (S. aureus) strains ranged from 0.028 to 0.11 mu M, and it had stronger activity (MIC = 0.04 to 0.23 mu M) to 20 clinical isolates of MRSA (cMRSA) than rNZ2114 (MIC = 0.11 to 0.90 mu M). rMP1102 was shown to kill over 99.9 % of tested S. aureus cells within 6 h when treated at one, two, and four times its MIC and over 90 % of S. aureus cells within 12 h at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg in a mouse thigh infection model. The higher sensitivity of MRSA to MP1102 than to its parental peptide, NZ2114, indicated by this initial pharmacodynamic analysis suggests a possible difference in the killing mechanism of these two molecules. rMP1102 caused less than 0.05 % hemolytic activity at 128 mu g/ml and exhibited good thermostability from 20 to 80 A degrees C, with its highest activity being observed at pH 8.0. These results suggest that this yeast expression system is feasible for large-scale production, and rMP1102 exerted stronger activity against S. aureus than NZ2114 via a different mechanism and exhibited potential as a new antimicrobial agent for S. aureus, especially MRSA infections.",0
"In this study, we synthesized two series of novel 5-nitrofuran-2-carbohydrazides 21a-h and 22a-e in addition to a third series of thiophene-2-carbohydrazides 23a-g to develop potent antimicrobial and/or antitubercular agents. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial and antimycobacterial activities. Most of the 5-nitrofuran-2-carbohydrazides 21a-h and 22a-e displayed variable activity against Aspergillus fumigates, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, Bacillis subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The sulfonamide derivative 211 exhibited superior potency and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=0.06-0.98 mu g/mL and antimycobacterial activity with MIC=3.9 mu g/mL. The 5-nitrofuran-2-carbohydrazides 21a, b, g, h and 22a-c exhibited significant antibacterial activity with MIC values in the range of 0.12-7.81 mu g/mL. The significances of the 5-nitrofuran moiety and sulfonamide function were explored via the structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. In addition, docking studies revealed that the p-amino benzoic acid (PABA) and binding pockets of the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) were successfully occupied by compound 21f. Furthermore, two quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models were built to explore the structural requirements which controlled the activity.",0
"The purpose of this work was to screen for and characterize the potential probiotic features of strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Galega cultivar fermented olives, to eventually develop an improved probiotic food from plant origin. From 156 isolated strains, 10 were acid - and bile salt tolerant, and exhibited survival rates up to 48%, following simulated digestion. All strains exhibited auto- (4-12%) and co-aggregation features (>= 30%), as well as hydrophobicity (5-20%) and exopolysaccharide-producing abilities, while no strain possessed haemolytic capacity or ability to hydrolyse mucin. Antibiotic resistance, oleuropein degradation, proteolytic activity and antimicrobial activity were strain-dependent features. Overall, 10 strains - belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus paraplantarum, appear to possess a probiotic value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Cyclic lipopeptides were produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strain BC32-1 that was isolated from yellow loess soil in the Jeonnam province of South Korea. Several lipopeptides were isolated from the bacteria using organic solvent extraction and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Purified iturin-, surfactin-, and fengycin-type lipopeptides were identified using liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Among the lipopeptides, C-17-fengycin B showed strong antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, and then the fengycin was further characterized by UV, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and LC-MS/MS analyses. C-17-fengycin B was highly produced at quantities of up to 15 A mu g/mL at 37A degrees C, whereas little amount of the fengycin was produced at 25A degrees C. Purified C-17-fengycin B inhibited mycelial growth of F. oxysporum with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 50 A mu g/mL. This study suggests that C-17-fengycin B is a major antifungal component produced by the BC32-1 strain that could be used as an environmentally friendly agent to control the phytopathogenic F. oxysporum.",0
"Finger millet (Elucine corocana), locally known as ragi, and probiotics have been recognized for their health benefits. In the present work we describe novel probiotic ragi malt (functional food) that has been prepared using ragi and probiotic Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Lm) and Bacillus subtilis natto (Bs), alone and in combination, for antagonistic activity against Vibrio cholerae (Vc). In vitro studies using pure cultures showed that each probiotic strain (Lm or Bs) was able to inhibit the planktonic growth of Vc as well as its ability to make biofilms and adhere to extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, Fn) that may function in vivo as initial ports of entrance of the pathogen. Interestingly, the combination of both probiotic strains (Lm plus Bs) produced the strongest activity against the Vc. When both cultures were used together in the ragi malt the antimicrobial activity against Vc was enhanced due to synergistic effect of both probiotic strains. The inclusion of both probiotic strains in the functional food produced higher amounts of beneficial fatty acids like linoleic and linolenic acid and increased the mineral content (iron and zinc). The viability and activity of Lm and Bs against Vc was further enhanced with the use of adjuvants like ascorbic acid, tryptone, cysteine hydrochloride and casein hydrolysate in the ragi malt. In sum, the intake of probiotic ragi malt supplemented with Lm and Bs may provide nutrition, energy, compounds of therapeutic importance and antagonistic activity against Vc to a large extent to the consumer.",0
"In the present study the oily and resinous fractions of cone from Pines roxburghii Sarg., was evaluated at different concentration (4000, 2000, 1000 and 500 mu g/mL) against the growth of some plant and human pathogenic bacteria namely; Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Ralstonia solanacearum, Erwinia amylovora and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion susceptibility test. The resinous fraction showed the highest antibacterial activity against the growth of Erwinia amylovora with inhibition zones 35 mm, 30 mm, 30 mm, and 22.33 +/- 2.51 mm, with the concentrations of 4000 mu g,/mL, 2000 mu g/mL, 1000 mu g/mL, and 500 mu g/mL, respectively, and Bacillus subtilis at the concentration of 4000 mu g/mL (Inhibition zone value of 13.33 +/- 1.52 mm) and at 2000 mu g/mL (12 mm). The oily fraction showed good activity against Bacillus subtilis, and Ralstonia solanacearum at the concentrations of 4000 mu g/mL with Inhibition zone values of 14.33 +/- 1.15 mm, and 13 +/- 1.73 mm, respectively. The resinous fraction from cone extract of Pines roxburghii could be useful as a natural biocide tool for controlling the growth of Erwinia amylovora.",0
"Cyanobacteria are a diverse group of Gram-negative bacteria that produce an array of secondary compounds with selective bioactivity against vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, bacteria and cell lines. Recently the main methods of controlling cyanobacteria are using chemicals, medicinal plants and microorganism but fewer involved the safety research in hydrophytic ecosystems. In search of an environmentally safe compound, 53 chemicals were screened against the developed heavy cyanobacteria bloom Microcystis aeruginosa using coexistence culture system assay. The results of the coexistence assay showed that 9 chemicals inhibited M. aeruginosa effectively at 20 mg L-1 after 7 days of exposure. Among them dimethomorph, propineb, and paraquat were identified that they are safe for Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus obliquus, Carassius auratus (Goldfish) and Bacillus subtilis within half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values 5.2, 4.2 and 0.06 mg L-1 after 7 days, respectively. Paraquat as the positive control observed to be more efficient than the other compounds with the inhibitory rate (IR) of 92 % at 0.5 mg L-1. For the potential inhibition mechanism, the chemicals could destroy the cell ultrastructure in different speed. The safety assay proved dimethomorph, propineb and paraquat as harmless formulations or products having potential value in M. aeruginosa controlling, with the advantage of its cell morphology degrading ability.",0
"Human pathogens often produce soluble protein toxins that generate pores inside membranes, resulting in the death of target cells and tissue damage. In pathogenic amoebae, this has been exemplified with amoebapores of the enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Here we characterize acanthaporin, to our knowledge the first pore-forming toxin to be described from acanthamoebae, which are free-living, bacteria-feeding, unicellular organisms that are opportunistic pathogens of increasing importance and cause severe and often fatal diseases. We isolated acanthaporin from extracts of virulent Acanthamoeba culbertsoni by tracking its pore-forming activity, molecularly cloned the gene of its precursor and recombinantly expressed the mature protein in bacteria. Acanthaporin was cytotoxic for human neuronal cells and exerted antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacterial strains by permeabilizing their membranes. The tertiary structures of acanthaporin's active monomeric form and inactive dimeric form, both solved by NMR spectroscopy, revealed a currently unknown protein fold and a pH-dependent trigger mechanism of activation.",0
"Plant disease resistance and susceptibility are greatly influenced by the availability of micronutrients, particularly manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn). Take-all disease of wheat, caused by a strong Mn oxidizing fungus (Gaeumannomyces graminis var tritici, Ggt), results in a lack of availability of Mn to plants and increases disease severity in wheat. Three commercial Trichoderma harzianum (Vitalin T-50, BioHealth (R)-WSG, and BioHealth (R)-G) and one Bacillus subtilis (Vitalin SP-11) were investigated individually and in combination (Vitalin T-50 and Vitalin SP-11) for growth promotion and Mn/Zn uptake of take-all infected wheat in a rhizobox experiment under greenhouse conditions. Inoculation with Trichoderma and Bacillus biofertilizers did not increase the shoot dry weight and shoot to root ratio, whilst shoot length was significantly increased with Vitalin T-50 and Biohealth-G treatments in the final harvest. Biofertilizers inoculation that significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced root surface area and root dry weight were Vitalin T-50, BioHelath-G and combination of Vitalin (T-50 + SP-11). The bulk soil pH was not influenced by biofertilizer inoculation, whereas rhizosphere and rhizoplane soil pH were significantly reduced (0.3 - 0.4 pH scale) in Vitalin (T-50 + SP-11) and BioHealth-G treatments and to a lesser extent by Vitalin T-50 inoculation. Manganese uptake in shoots of wheat exhibited no significant differences among the biofertilizer treatments. On the contrary, Zn uptake was significantly higher in Vitalin T-50, Vitalin (T-50 + SP-11), BioHealth-G, and BioHealth-WSG (47, 64, 44, and 45%, respectively) inoculated plants. Therefore, Vitalin T-50 and Biohealth-G showed better performance in improving plant growth and Zn uptake.",0
"To investigate the biocontrol mechanism of two antagonistic Bacillus strains (Bacillus subtilis MB14 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens MB101), three in vitro antagonism assays were screened and the results were concluded that both strains inhibited Rhizoctonia solani growth in a similar manner by dual culture assay, but the maximum percent of inhibition only resulted with MB101 by volatile and diffusible metabolite assays. Moreover, cell free supernatant (CFS) of MB101 also showed significant (p>0.05) growth inhibition as compared to MB14, when 10 and 20% CFS mix with the growth medium of R. solani. After in vitro-validation, both strains were evaluated under greenhouse and the results concluded that strain MB101 had significant biocontrol potential as compared to MB14. Strain MB101 was enhanced the plant height, biomass and chlorophyll content of tomato plant through a higher degree of root colonization. In field trials, strain MB101 showed higher lessening in root rot symptoms with significant fruit yield as compare to strain MB14 and infected control. Next to the field study, the presence of four antibiotic genes (srfAA, fenD, ituC, and bmyB) also concluded the antifungal nature of both Bacillus strains. Phylogenetic analysis of protein sequences revealed a close relatedness of three genes (srfAA, fenD, and ituC) with earlier reported sequences of B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens. However, bmyB showed heterogeneity in among both strains (MB14 and MB101) and it may be concluded that higher degree of antagonism, root colonization and different antibiotic producing genes may play an important role in biocontrol mechanism of strain MB101.",0
"Horizontal DNA transfer (HDT) is a pervasive mechanism of diversification in many microbial species, but its primary evolutionary role remains controversial. Much recent research has emphasised the adaptive benefit of acquiring novel DNA, but here we argue instead that intragenomic conflict provides a coherent framework for understanding the evolutionary origins of HDT. To test this hypothesis, we developed a mathematical model of a clonally descended bacterial population undergoing HDT through transmission of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and genetic transformation. Including the known bias of transformation toward the acquisition of shorter alleles into the model suggested it could be an effective means of counteracting the spread of MGEs. Both constitutive and transient competence for transformation were found to provide an effective defence against parasitic MGEs; transient competence could also be effective at permitting the selective spread of MGEs conferring a benefit on their host bacterium. The coordination of transient competence with cell-cell killing, observed in multiple species, was found to result in synergistic blocking of MGE transmission through releasing genomic DNA for homologous recombination while simultaneously reducing horizontal MGE spread by lowering the local cell density. To evaluate the feasibility of the functions suggested by the modelling analysis, we analysed genomic data from longitudinal sampling of individuals carrying Streptococcus pneumoniae. This revealed the frequent within-host coexistence of clonally descended cells that differed in their MGE infection status, a necessary condition for the proposed mechanism to operate. Additionally, we found multiple examples of MGEs inhibiting transformation through integrative disruption of genes encoding the competence machinery across many species, providing evidence of an ongoing ""arms race."" Reduced rates of transformation have also been observed in cells infected by MGEs that reduce the concentration of extracellular DNA through secretion of DNases. Simulations predicted that either mechanism of limiting transformation would benefit individual MGEs, but also that this tactic's effectiveness was limited by competition with other MGEs coinfecting the same cell. A further observed behaviour we hypothesised to reduce elimination by transformation was MGE activation when cells become competent. Our model predicted that this response was effective at counteracting transformation independently of competing MGEs. Therefore, this framework is able to explain both common properties of MGEs, and the seemingly paradoxical bacterial behaviours of transformation and cell-cell killing within clonally related populations, as the consequences of intragenomic conflict between self-replicating chromosomes and parasitic MGEs. The antagonistic nature of the different mechanisms of HDT over short timescales means their contribution to bacterial evolution is likely to be substantially greater than previously appreciated.",0
"This experiment was conducted to study the effects of Bacillus subtilis on immune function and disease resistance of immunized and unimmunized Huanghe carp ( Cyprinus carpio Huanghe var.). A total of 1 920 Huanghe carp with an average initial body weight of (35.360.46) g were randomly divided into 8 groups (groups I to VIII) with 3 replicates per group and 80 fish per replicate. The groups I to IV were immunized groups which were injected antigen, and the groups V to VIII were control groups which were injected stroke-physiological saline solution. The supplemental levels of Bacillus subtilis in the experimental diets were 0 (groups I and V), 1.5*10 11 (groups II and VI), 3.0*10 11 (groups III and VII) and 4.5*10 11 CFU/kg (groups IV and VIII), respectively. The experimental fish were fed the experimental diets for 28 days, and subsequently fed the basal diet for 28 days. The leukocytes phagocytic activity, serum lysozyme activity and serum antibody titer were determined on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th and 42nd day after immunization. The experimental fish were challenged by Aeromonas hydrophila on the 42nd day after immunization, and the mortality of each group was counted for the calculation of immune protection rate. The results showed as follows: Bacillus subtilis supplementation could significantly improve the leukocytes phagocytic percentage and phagocytic index, and serum lysozyme activity of immunized and unimmunized Huanghe carp ( P<0.05). The serum antibody titer of Huanghe carp in group III was the highest, which was 486.7; the second was group IV, which was 372.6; the third was group II, which was 234.6; the last one was group I, which was 192.8. The Huanghe carp in immunized groups all had a certain immune protection rate, and the supplementation of 4.5*10 11 CFU/kg Bacillus subtilis induced the highest immune protection rate of immunized Huanghe carp. It is concluded that the supplementation of Bacillus subtilis can improve the immune function and disease resistance of immunized and unimmunized Huanghe carp, and the supplemental level of Bacillus subtilis in diets is suggested to be 3.0*10 11 to 4.5*10 11 CFU/kg.",0
"Traditionally Jatropha tanjorensis is being used as an alternative medicine and the phytochemical investigation of this plant has proved that the leaves contain antioxidant, anti-hyperglycaemic and antiinflammatory bio molecules. The crude protein extract was analyzed by non-reducing native-PAGE, which showed three prominent protein bands with molecular weight of about 78.6, 67.8 and 43.3 KDa. Further, 2D studies and mass spectrometric (MS) analysis were done separately. Protein separations were examined using pH 3-10 nonlinear IEF strip. Totally 89 protein spots were detected differing in their pI values, suggesting a possible difference in their electrostatic charge. In regard to mass spectrometric analysis coupled with in-gel digestions were performed for 5 major protein spots using trypsin and were identified through peptide mass fingerprint of selected peptides in UHPLC-ESI-Quad-TOF and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Proteomic approach lead to the identification of major proteins from J. tanjorensis. Among various proteins, redox enzymes and DNA binding proteins were found to be most abundantly extracted proteins. These classes of proteins are known for their antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer activities and hence the extracted proteins were evaluated for their biological activities with a view to develop a novel therapeutic agent. The proteins extract revealed potent antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, when compared to standards. It showed IC50 value as 173 mu g/mL for DPPH scavenging, LPO inhibition (226.2 mu g/mL) and hydroxyl ion reducing assays (269.5 mu g/mL). In antimicrobial studies it was effective against both gram positive and negative bacteria's such as S. aureus MTCC 96, S. aureus MTCC EI, P. aeruginosa MTCC 741, P. aeruginosa MTCC EI, B. subtilis MTCC 441 and E. coli MTCC 723 with MIC values ranging from 7.8-15.6 ae g/mL which are comparable to MIC values of standard antibiotics. Jatropha tanjorensis protein extract has also shown potent cytotoxicity against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) with an IC50 of 49.9 mu g/mL. Present study scientifically proves the traditional usage of Jatropha tanjorensis as a health tonic and for the management of microbial infections.",0
"The rise of bacterial resistance against important drugs threatens their clinical utility. Fluoroquinones, one of the most important classes of contemporary antibiotics has also reported to suffer bacterial resistance. Since the general mechanism of bacterial resistance against fluoroquinone antibiotics (e.g. ofloxacin) consists of target mutations resulting in reduced membrane permeability and increased efflux by the bacteria, strategies that could increase bacterial uptake and reduce efflux of the drug would provide effective treatment. In the present study, we have compared the efficiencies of ofloxacin delivered in the form of free drug (OFX) and as nanoparticles on bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity. Although both poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (OFX-PLGA) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (OFX-mPEG-PLGA) nanoformulations presented improved bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity against all the tested human bacterial pathogens, namely, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, OFX-mPEG-PLGA showed significantly higher bacterial uptake and antibacterial activity compared to OFX-PLGA. We have also found that mPEG-PLGA nanoencapsulation could significantly inhibit Bacillus subtilis resistance development against OFX. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Honey is a natural medicinal substance, has been applied since ancient times as a natural remedy of various aliments and diseases. It is valued to possess antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity. The object of the present study was to determine the invitro antimicrobial activity of different honeys samples belonging to Pakistani floral sources against certain clinical pathogens and to compared with commercial antibiotics. For the investigation of antimicrobial activity ten different floral sources Apis mellifera honey samples ( 09= Mix flora, 11= Gossypium species, 13= Phoenix dactylifera, 35= Salvadora persica, 39= Mangifera indica, 46= Acacia, 56= Carissa opaca, 58= Helianthus annuus, 59= Zizyphus, 65= Medicago sativa) were used, harvested during 2003 - 04 and 2004-05. The antimicrobial activity of honey samples were evaluated by ICLS (formerly NCCLS) reference Disc diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) method against recently isolated most common six Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium diptheriae), eleven Gram-negative ( Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteries, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhi para A, Salmonella typhi para B, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aerugenosa) bacteria and one Fungus ( Candida albicans), commonly encountered in human infections. Most of the samples of honey used in the study exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and promising antifungal activity. The results indicated that activity was present in all the honey samples. Comparison of crude honey samples with the existing commercial antibiotics was also carried out, in all cases the honey samples were found comparable to antibiotics used in the study.",0
"The aim of the present study is to screen and characterize endogenous microbiota Bacillus spp. from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of Labeo rohita in order to evaluate their probiotic attributes. A total of 74 isolates from the GI of L. rohita were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties by agar well-diffusion method against fish pathogens. Based on the better antibacterial features, three isolates (KADR1, KADR3, and KADR4) were selected for further delineation. The three selected isolates exhibited higher tolerance to bile salt, moderate tolerance to low pH, high surface hydrophobicity to solvents, and capable to autoaggregate. All three isolates demonstrated notable proteolytic, catalase activity and susceptibility to various antibiotics. Partial 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the isolates exhibited 99 % sequence homology with Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus aerophilus, and Bacillus firmus of the database substantiating morphological and physiological characterization. Survivability in low pH and bile salt ensures their adaptability in the fish intestinal microenvironment. The ability to autoaggregate reveals colonization potential in the GI of the fish. Absence of hemolytic activity, antibiotic susceptibility to certain antibiotics, presence of protease and catalase activity, and non-pathogenic caliber of the above-mentioned isolates could be feasible characteristics when considering them as probiotics in the aquaculture industry.",0
"The novel neutral mononuclear copper(II) complexes with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug, sparfloxacin and nitrogen donor heterocyclic ligand have been synthesized and characterized. An antimicrobial efficiency of the complexes has been tested against five different microorganisms and showed diverse biological activity. The interaction of complex with Herring sperm (HS) DNA was investigated using viscosity titration and absorption titration techniques. The results indicate that the complexes bind to DNA by intercalative mode and have rather high DNA-binding constants. DNA cleavage study showed better cleaving ability of the complexes compare to metal salt and standard drug. All the complexes showed good cytotoxic activity with LC50 values ranging from 4.89 to 11.94 mu g mL(-1). Complexes also exhibit SOD-like activity with their IC50 values ranging from 0.717 to 1.848 mu M. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"Nucleotide sequence analysis of several genes responsible for definitive properties of the anthrax pathogen-motility and penicillinase activity-determined a chromosomal locus promising for interspecies differentiation. We demonstrated that the fliC gene encoding flagellin synthesis contains an extended region distinguishing B. anthracis strains from the majority of nonpathogenic and opportunistic bacilli. A novel method for anthrax pathogen indication and identification based on determination of the differences in the fliC and hom2 chromosomal genes structure has been proposed. A total of 60 strains of different Bacillus spp. (B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, etc.) were tested using two chromosomal DNA targets. The algorithm developed in this work permits detection of the pathogenic microorganism and reliably differentiation of it from other Bacillus spp. representatives. The introduction of primers complementary to specific sequences of pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids into multiplex PCR makes it possible to obtain additional information on the proposed virulence of the isolate.",0
"Bacterial biofilms are highly structured, surface associated bacteria colonies held together by a cell-generated polymer network known as EPS (extracellular polymeric substance). This polymer network assists in adhesion to surfaces and generates spreading forces as colonies grow over time. In the laboratory and in nature, biofilms often grow at the interface between air and an elastic, semi-permeable nutrient source. As this type of biofilm increases in volume, an accommodating compression of its substrate may arise, potentially driven by the osmotic pressure exerted by the EPS against the substrate surface. Here we study Bacillus subtilis biofilm force generation by measuring the magnitude and rate of deformation imposed by colonies against the agar-nutrient slabs on which they grow. We find that the elastic stress stored in deformed agar is orders of magnitude larger than the drag stress associated with pulling fluid through the agar matrix. The stress exerted by the biofilm is nearly the same as the osmotic pressure generated by the EPS, and mutant colonies incapable of producing EPS exert much lower levels of stress. The fluid flow rate into B. subtilis biofilms suggest that EPS generated pressure provides some metabolic benefit as colonies expand in volume. These results reveal that long-term biofouling and colony expansion may be tied to the hydraulic permeability and elasticity of the surfaces that biofilms colonize.",0
"Currently, novel antibiotics are urgently required to combat the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial peptides with membrane-lytic mechanism of action have attracted considerable interest. Anoplin, a natural -helical amphiphilic antimicrobial peptide, is an ideal research template because of its short sequence. In this study, we designed and synthesized a group of analogues of anoplin. Among these analogues, anoplin-4 composed of d-amino acids displayed the highest antimicrobial activity due to increased charge, hydrophobicity and amphiphilicity. Gratifyingly, anoplin-4 showed low toxicity to host cells, indicating high bacterial selectivity. Furthermore, the mortality rate of mice infected with Escherichia coli was significantly reduced by anoplin-4 treatment relative to anoplin. In conclusion, anoplin-4 is a novel anoplin analogue with high antimicrobial activity and enzymatic stability, which may represent a potent agent for the treatment of infection.

"The coelomic cells of the earthworm consist of leukocytes, chlorogocytes, and coelomocytes, which play an important role in innate immunity reactions. To gain insight into the expression profiles of coelomic cells of the earthworm, Eisenia andrei, we analyzed 1151 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) derived from the cDNA library of the coelomic cells. Among the 1151 ESTs analyzed, 493 ESTs (42.8%) showed a significant similarity to known genes and represented 164 unique genes, of which 93 ESTs were singletons and 71 ESTs manifested as two or more ESTs. From the 164 unique genes sequenced, we found 24 immune-related and cell defense genes. Furthermore, real-time PCR analysis showed that levels of lysenin-related proteins mRNA in coelomic cells of E. andrei were upregulated after the injection of Bacillus subtilis bacteria. This EST data-set would provide a valuable resource for future researches of earthworm immune system.",0
"The replacement of coal with other energy sources is due to the presence of harmful impurities such as sulfur that can lead to emission of harmful and corrosive gases such as H2S and SO2. These gases can affect the human health due to its toxicity. Also, the mineral matter (ash) can cause several types of respiratory system diseases due to the presence of heavy metals and formation of hazardous compounds while burning of coal. In order to avoid the production of such emissions, the researchers all over the world were looking for a methodology that can eliminate or reduce these impurities from coal. Therefore, the current study aims at decreasing the sulfur and ash content in Egyptian coal (Maghara coal), using bioflotation technique. The effect of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) on the removal/reduction of sulfur and ash was investigated. The affinity of B. subtilis to coal surface was characterized using zeta-potential, adsorption tests and Fourier transform infrared. The bioflotation results showed that, at optimum conditions, a clean coal contains 0.92 % total sulfur and 1.95 % ash and yield exceeding 72 % was obtained from the starting coal containing 3.3 % sulfur and 6.65 % ash.",0
"Sponges, which constitute the phylum Porifera, are the most primitive of the multicellular animals, among all marine organisms screened. Marine sponges produce the largest number of structurally diversified natural products. In this study we investigated in vitro antimicrobial activity of Ircinia mutans collected from the Kish Island in the Persian Gulf against strains of bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC 15224), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 25619), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 1764), and Bacillus subtilis spizizenii (ATCC 6633). Diethyl etter, methanol and aqueous extracts of sponge were evaluated by using the Bacterial Broth Dilution Method. The results showed that the aqueous extracts didn't have any antibacterial activity. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of the winter diethyl etter extract was 2 mg/ml for E. coli and 20 mg/ml for P. aeruginosa, whereas the summer diethyl etter extract and both of methanol extracts did not show any activity. The MIC and MBC (Minimum Bacterial Concentration) of summer diethyl etter extracts were 2 mg/ml and 3mg/ml against S. aureus; and 5mg/ml and 10mg/ml when tested on B. subtilis. The MIC and MBC of winter diethyl etter extracts were measured as 1.5 mg/ml and 2mg/ml against S. aurous; and 5mg/ml and 10mg/ml when examined on B. subtilis. Summer and winter methanol and aqueous extracts of I. mutans did not show any activity against these bacteria. Therefore secondary metabolite solutions in diethyl etter contain components with antibacterial properties and can be used as antibiotics products.",0
"Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is one of the most serious postharvest diseases of mango (Mangifera indica) resulting from the quiescent phase of infection occurring in the field. Bacillus megaterium isolate 3103 (BM-3103) was the most outstanding among a large number of phylloplane bacterial flora tested in the laboratory for antagonism towards C. gloeosporioides. A mango-leaf assay was developed during 2007-2008 in order to evaluate the antagonistic potential of BM-3103 on C. gloeosporioides diversity. The experiment was conducted on surface sterilized immature, light-green coloured leaves of 'Nam-dok-mai' mango. Drops of C. gloeosporioides spore suspensions, together with BM-3103 cell suspensions, were placed on the upper sides of the leaves at pre-marked target sites. The inoculated leaves were incubated at 26-28 degrees C in humid conditions to allow disease development. Antagonism to 14 C. gloeosporioides isolates tested resulted in an average reduction in lesion diameter from 5.12 mm on non-protected to 0.79 mm on protected treatments, and proved that BM-3103 was an aggressive antagonist towards C. gloeosporioides diversity. Biological control capability on quiescent infection caused by C. gloeosporioides was determined under commercial field conditions. A BM-3103 cell suspension was sprayed on to 'Nam-dok-mai-seethong' mango canopies every 14 days starting from flowering and continuing to harvesting of mature green fruit. Incidence of anthracnose on postharvest mangoes incubated in conditions favouring disease development indicated promising efficacy of BM-3103 by the reduction in disease severity. Diseased areas on the fruit surface, and total numbers of diseased fruit decreased by 20.3 and 13.5%, respectively 7 days after symptoms first appeared.",0
"The instability of messenger RNA is fundamental to the control of gene expression. In bacteria, mRNA degradation generally follows an ""all-or-none"" pattern. This implies that if control is to be efficient, it must occur at the initiating (and presumably rate-limiting) step of the degradation process. Studies of E. coli and B. subtilis, species separated by 3 billion years of evolution, have revealed the principal and very disparate enzymes involved in this process in the two organisms. The early view that mRNA decay in these two model organisms is radically different has given way to new models that can be resumed by ""different enzymes-similar strategies"". The recent characterization of key ribonucleases sheds light on an impressive case of convergent evolution that illustrates that the surprisingly similar functions of these totally unrelated enzymes are of general importance to RNA metabolism in bacteria. We now know that the major mRNA decay pathways initiate with an endonucleolytic cleavage in E. coli and B. subtilis and probably in many of the currently known bacteria for which these organisms are considered representative. We will discuss here the different pathways of eubacterial mRNA decay, describe the major players and summarize the events that can precede and/or favor nucleolytic inactivation of a mRNA, notably the role of the 5' end and translation initiation. Finally, we will discuss the role of subcellular compartmentalization of transcription, translation, and the RNA degradation machinery.",0
"Current antibiofilm solutions based on planktonic bacterial physiology have limited efficacy in clinical and occasionally environmental settings. This has prompted a search for suitable alternatives to conventional therapies. This study compares the inhibitory properties of two biological surfactants (rhamnolipids and a plant-derived surfactant) against a selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin). Testing was carried out on a range of bacterial physiologies from planktonic and mixed bacterial biofilms. Rhamnolipids (Rhs) have been extensively characterised for their role in the development of biofilms and inhibition of planktonic bacteria. However, there are limited direct comparisons with antimicrobial substances on established biofilms comprising single or mixed bacterial strains. Baseline measurements of inhibitory activity using planktonic bacterial assays established that broad-spectrum antibiotics were 500 times more effective at inhibiting bacterial growth than either Rhs or plant surfactants. Conversely, Rhs and plant biosurfactants reduced biofilm biomass of established single bacterial biofilms by 74-88 and 74-98 %, respectively. Only kanamycin showed activity against biofilms of Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were also ineffective against a complex biofilm of marine bacteria; however, Rhs and plant biosurfactants reduced biofilm biomass by 69 and 42 %, respectively. These data suggest that Rhs and plant-derived surfactants may have an important role in the inhibition of complex biofilms.",0
"Common scab, caused by Streptomyces scabiei is an economically important potato disease worldwide. The potato industry in New Brunswick, Canada experience $ 1.2 million loss every year due to this disease. Superficial, raised, or deep-pitted brownish lesions on infected tubers reduce the quality and marketability of both fresh-market and processing potatoes, and hence, common scab is considered a priority disease for which adequate control measures are lacking. The objective of this research was to compare various potential treatments in suppressing the disease. Two field experiments were conducted at McCain's Research Farm, Florenceville-Bristol, New Brunswick, Canada, in 2008 and 2009 to assess the efficacy of Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Chloropicrin, Pic-Plus, manganese sulphate and mustard meal in comparison with the chemical controls fludioxonil and mancozeb against common scab of potato. The disease incidence was significantly reduced by 36% due to the addition of mustard meal to the soil; 35.4% due to fludioxonil seed treatment; 30.0% due to soil fumigation with Pic-Plus; or by 27.2% due to soil fumigation with Chloropicrin. Potato tubers with scab severity >= 5% which are considered unmarketable in Canada were significantly reduced by 56.1% due to seed treatments with B. subtilis; by 57.8% due to fludioxonil; or by 63.1% due to the soil addition of mustard meal. The same treatments significantly increased marketable yield by 32.5%, 24.6%, and 24.6%, respectively. Soil fumigation with Chloropicrin or Pic-Plus increased marketable yield by 9.5% or 7.1%, respectively. These findings indicate that, in addition to the fludioxonil seed treatment, the seed treatment with the biopesticide containing B. subtilis and the soil addition of mustard meal treatments are potential alternatives for managing common scab of potatoes.",0
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the microwave synthesized 2-(3,5-dimethoxy-4-methylbenzyl)-5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles (DMAO) scaffold against B. subtilis, E. coli and yeast cells to identify their new antimicrobial potential. To synthesize DMAO scaffold, 3,5-Dimethyoxy-4-methylbenzoylhydrazide was irradiated with substituted benzoic acids in the presence of thionyl chloride. Compound 2 showed maximum inhibition against the bacterial cell while compounds 1, 5, 6 and 8 showed maximum inhibition against the fungal cell cultures. New lead compounds were identified to possess potent antimicrobial activities.",0
"Several endophytes play a vital role in plant protection and plant growth promotion. In China, poplar canker disease caused by three pathogens (Cytospora chrysosperma, Phomopsis macrospora and Fusicoccum aesculi) is difficult to control by use of chemicals; therefore, use of biocontrol agents is desirable. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of strain JK-SX001 on plant growth and poplar canker caused by three pathogens. It is clearly demonstrated that strain JK-SX001 described as Bacillus pumilus by the Biolog identification system combined with morphological, physiological and biochemical tests and phylogenetic (16S rDNA) studies. Strain JK-SX001 produced lytic enzymes such as cellulases and protease. In vitro antagonistic assays showed that secondary metabolites of JK-SX001 extracted using methylbenzene could suppress the growth of three pathogens effectively. A derivative of this strain, labeled with gfp, was also used to study the colonization of its poplar hosts. This strain was verified as an endophytic bacterium of poplar by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The population of the GFP-labeled JK-SX001 inoculant was larger and more stable in roots and stems than that in leaves. The evaluation of the antagonistic strains against poplar canker indicated that JK-SX001 effectively reduced disease incidence. In greenhouse studies, poplar seedlings inoculated with this strain showed high increase in biomass production, shoot length, stem diameter and photosynthetic activity. Strain JK-SX001 colonized poplar roots, stems and leaves endophytically, promoting plant growth and suppressing pathogenic activities on seedling of poplar. Our results demonstrate JK-SX001 as a promising candidate for biocontrol of poplar canker. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"In this study, we investigated the role of protein kinases C (PKCs) in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 secretion by human lung epithelial A549 cells during infection with the fungal pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Rottlerin and the broad spectrum PKC inhibitor Go 6983 reduced cytokine levels in A549 cell-P. brasiliensis cultures. Next, by western blot, we verified that infection with this fungus led to phosphorylation of PKC delta (Thr(505)). By using a peptide inhibitor for PKC delta or PKC delta short interfering RNA technique, IL-6 and IL-8 levels in A549-P. brasiliensis cultures were also reduced. Together, these results indicate that P. brasiliensis promotes IL-6 and IL-8 secretion by A549 cells in a PKC delta-dependent manner.",0
"Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a causative pathogen of nosocomial infection, expresses its virulent traits such as biofilm and autolysis regulated by two-component signal transduction system SaeRS. In this study, the S. epidermidis SaeRS was identified to negatively regulate the expression of genes involved in competence (comF, murF), cytolysis (lrgA), and autolysis (lytS) by DNA microarray or real-time RT-PCR analysis. In addition, saeRS mutant showed increased competence and higher susceptibility to antibiotics such as penicillin and oxacillin than the wild-type strain. The study will be helpful for understanding the characterization of the SaeRS in S. epidermidis.",0
"Aim: The upsurge of cases of adverse reactions, complications and herbal drug-induced infections in developing countries, due to the use of herbal remedies, have generated deep public health concern about the microbiological status and safety of the products. The aim of this study was to assess the level of microbial contamination of herbal medicines commonly sold in Calabar, Nigeria. Methodology and results: A total of 28 herbal medicines comprising 16 liquid and 12 solid dosage forms were evaluated for microbial contaminants. The isolation of microbial contaminants was carried out using standard plate techniques, while specific microbial genera were enumerated on appropriate selective media. The microorganisms were identified using standard identification protocols with the aid of identification and taxonomic manuals. The results showed that 71.43% of the samples yielded high counts of viable microorganisms, which exceeded the tolerable limit stated in United State Pharmacopoeia. The total viable microbial count of all the solid dosage forms ranged from 2.05*10 4 to 5.6*10 4 CFU/g. Of the 28 samples studied, 18 samples (64.29%) contained heterotrophic bacteria and molds, respectively, while coliforms and yeast were present in 15(53.57%) and 12(42.86%) of the samples. The microorganisms recovered and their percentage occurrence in the solid and liquid dosage forms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.54, 18.31%); Bacillus subtilis (17.31, 11.27%); Klebsiella sp. (5.77, 9.86%); Staphylococcus aureus (15.38, 14.08%); Escherichia coli (3.85,12.60%); Salmonella sp. (3.85,9.86%); Enterobacter sp. (5.77, 7.04%); Aspergillus flavus (5.77,2.82%) Aspergillus niger (11.54,4.23%); Fusarium sp. (5.77,2.82%) and Candida tropicalis (3.85, 1.41%). Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Microbial contaminants may cause spoilage of the herbal drugs and hence pose serious health risk to consumers. Therefore, adequate quality control measures and good manufacturing practice must be employed by herbal drugs producers, while relevant regulatory agencies should closely monitor the production processes, to ensure that microbiologically safe herbal drugs are marketed.",0
"Background: Bacillus anthracis is the causative agent of anthrax, a disease associated with a very high mortality rate in its invasive forms. Methods: We studied a number of ebselen analogs as inhibitors of B. anthracis thioredoxin reductase and their antibacterial activity on Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results: The most potent compounds in the series gave IC50 values down to 70 nM for the pure enzyme and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) down to 0.4 mu M (0.12 mu g/ml) for B. subtilis,1.5 mu M (0.64 mu g/ml) for S. aureus, 2 mu M (0.86 mu g/ml) for B. cereus and 10 mu g/ml for M. tuberculosis. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were found at 1-1.5 times the MIC, indicating a general, class-dependent, bactericidal mode of action. The combined bacteriological and enzymological data were used to construct a preliminary structure-activity-relationship for the benzoisoselenazol class of compounds. When S. aureus and B. subtilis were exposed to ebselen, we were unable to isolate resistant mutants on both solid and in liquid medium suggesting a high resistance barrier. Conclusions: These results suggest that ebselen and analogs thereof could be developed into a novel antibiotic class, useful for the treatment of infections caused by B. anthracis, S. aureus, M. tuberculosis and other clinically important bacteria. Furthermore, the high barrier against resistance development is encouraging for further drug development. General significance: We have characterized the thioredoxin system from B. anthracis as a novel drug target and ebselen and analogs thereof as a potential new class of antibiotics targeting several important human pathogens.

"The essential oil from the aerial parts of Agrimonia aitchisonii Schonbeck Temesy growing in the Himalayan region is evaluated for its antifungal, antibacterial and antioxidant activity. The oil has shown 100% mycelia growth inhibition against S. sclerotiorum, A. tenuis, C. graminicola and F. oxysporum at a concentration of 2000 g/ml, 2000 g/ml, 3000 g/ml and 3000 g/ml respectively. However R. solani was found less susceptible to the oil of Agrimonia aitchisonii. The IC 50 values showed a range from 41.10 g/ml-85.44 g/ml as compared to standard fungicides with IC 50 values 32.8 g/ml-98.6 g/ml. The spore germination inhibition test has shown the IC 50 values as 101.4 g/ml, 314.74 g/ml and 684.7 g/ml for A. tenuis, C. graminicola and F. oxysporum respectively.

The VEAC values were found to be 0.4540.003 g/L and 0.5380.001 g/L for the essential oil and ascorbic acid respectively.",0
"Despite the enormous contributions of the bacterial paradigms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis to basic and applied research, it is well known that no single organism can be a perfect representative-of all other species. However, given that some bacteria are difficult, or virtually impossible, to cultivate in the laboratory, that some are recalcitrant to genetic and molecular manipulation, and that others can be extremely dangerous to manipulate, the use of model organisms will continue to play an important role in the development of basic research. In particular, model organisms are very useful for providing a better understanding of the biology of closely related species. Here, we discuss how the lifestyle, the availability of suitable in vitro and in vivo systems, and a thorough understanding of the genetics, biochemistry and physiology of the dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans have greatly advanced our understanding of important areas in the field of bacteriology such as interspecies biofilms, competence development and stress responses. In this article, we provide an argument that places S. mutans, an organism that evolved in close association with the human host, as a novel Gram-positive model organism.",0
"The main volatile compounds from three medicinal plants belonging to Lamiaceae family were screened for their biological properties. The plants were Salvia officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, and Mentha x piperita containing as the main volatile constituents thujone, thymol, and menthol, respectively. The applied chromatographic system was silica gel developed with toluene-ethyl acetate (93:7). Thin-layer chromatography - direct bioautography (TLC-DB) against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis was used for detection of antibacterial activity of the plant extracts and essential oils. The bioautographic fingerprints were compared with the fingerprints obtained after derivatization with anisaldehyde.",0
"Verticillium wilt of cotton is a major limiting factor in cotton production. To investigate the combined control effects of endophytic bacteria in different growth stages of cotton on Verticillium wilt, antagonistic bacteria Paenibacillus xylanilyticus YUPP-1, Paenibacillus polymyxa YUPP-8 and Bacillus subtilis YUPP-2 were isolated from cotton in the seedling, squaring and boll-setting stages, respectively. Assessment of colonization showed that strains YUPP-1, YUPP-8 and YUPP-2 had the highest populations in the seedling, squaring and boll-setting period, respectively. Indoor pot experiment indicated that cotton plants in the combined biocontrol bacteria treatment group were not infected before squaring stage, while infection rates of cotton treated with a single strain in the seedling period were 6.7% (strain YUPP-8), 6.7% (strain YUPP-1) and 13.3% (strain YUPP-2). However, infection rate of the control plants reached 80%. Field experiment conducted during 2010-2011 showed that the combined application of three strains had better effect than individual application. Verticillium wilt morbidity rate and disease index of cotton at the boll-setting period with combined application of three strains in 2010 were 9.4% and 6.5, respectively, while those in the control group were 47.5% and 32.8. The results in 2011 were similar to 2010, with higher disease severity in both treated and control plants. These results illustrated that combined application of endophytic bacteria can achieve good control effects against Verticillium wilt of cotton. This study provides a new strategy for the control of soil-borne diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Crystalline structure of nanoparticles may influence their physicochemical behaviour as well as their toxicological impact on biota. The differences in orientation of the atoms result in the variations in chemical stability. Thus, toxicological impacts of different crystalline phases of aluminium oxide nanoparticles are expected to vary. The present study brings out a comparative toxicity analysis of gamma-phase and alpha-phase aluminium oxide nanoparticles of comparable hydrodynamic size range towards a freshwater bacterial isolate Bacillus licheniformis at low exposure concentrations (5, 1, 0.5 and 0.05 A mu g/mL). Upon 2-h exposure, the alpha-aluminium oxide particles showed lower toxicity than the gamma-phase aluminium oxide. The lower level of oxidative stress generation and cell membrane damage in case of the alpha-phase aluminium oxide nanoparticles substantiated the toxicity results. The involvement of protein, lipopolysaccharides in nanoparticle-cell surface interaction, was noted in both the cases. To conclude, the crystallinity of aluminium oxide nanoparticles played an important role in the interaction and the toxicity response.",0
"The efficacy of two plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains including Bacillus subtilis TU-Orga1 and Pseudomonas fluorescens TU-Orga2 obtained from rice rhizosphere against naturally occurring diseases as well as their capacity to improve crop yield of sweet corn cv. Insee2 was studied. TU-Orga1 was significantly greater in inhibition of Acidovorax avenae subsp. avenae ( Aaa) and Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. zeae ( Ecz), caused bacterial leaf streak and stalk rot of corn, respectively by antibiosis. Greenhouse experiments using TU-Orga1 and TU-Orga2 treatments increased highest salicylic acid accumulation in corn leaves with 7.85 and 6.98 mg g -1 fresh weight, respectively to protect Ecz infection. Each PGPR strain was single applied in the field through seed treatment and 3-foliar-spray-intervals at 14, 21, and 28 days after planting. Two PGPR treatments resulted in reduced severity of all diseases and increased yields when compared with the control treatment. There were differences among the treatments in that the highest level of disease suppression of bacterial stalk rot resulted with treatments TU-Orga1 (P=0.05), whereas TU-Orga2 showed the highest level of disease suppression of bacterial leaf streak and sugarcane mosaic virus and provided significantly greater marketable yield increases than the other treatments. This illustrates the potential of these new biocontrol agents to suppress multiple diseases. They could become a component of an integrated program or an organic farming for corn disease management.",0
"OBJECTIVE: Chlorhexidine (CHX) is one of the most widely used antiseptic, especially in dentistry. At low concentrations CHX is bacteriostatic and at high concentrations acts bactericidal causing cell death by cytolysis. In this study, we performed a systematic review of pharmaco-biological activity and application of CHX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles for inclusion in this review were retrieved from online databases PubMed/Medline. The selected papers were included in the present manuscript according to their relevance for the topic. RESULTS: Totally 75 papers were enrolled in this research. CHX has strong biocidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria and weaker activity against Gram-negative bacteria. It is also active against yeasts, some dermatophytes and some lipophilic viruses. The most widely application CHX has found in dentistry and antisepsis. Numerous studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of CHX in reducing of plaque accumulation, in tooth caries, gingivitis, periodontitis and in alveolar osteitis. Unfortunately, CHX exhibits cytotoxic activity on human cells, can cause colorization of teeth and fillings, and its activity depends on the pH of the environment and the presence of organic substances. CONCLUSIONS: CHX plays a valuable role in the dentistry and antisepsis. However, it can also cause side effects, limiting its application time.",0
"New series of quinoline derivatives were synthesized from 2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehydes. In the reaction sequence, substituted acetanilides were cyclized to give 2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehydes 2a-d, which were transformed to 6a-d, which were then cyclized to give azetidinones 9a-d. The key scaffolds viz., 2-methoxy derivatives 3a-d, obtained from 2a-d were converted to target Schiff bases 4a-d, 5a-d and azetidinones 7a-d, 8a-d in good yields. Structures of these compounds were established by FTIR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and mass spectrometry. The compounds 4a-d to 9a-d were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera and antitubercular activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv. The Schiff bases and azetidinone derivatives exhibited good antibacterial and antitubercular activities. Bacterial enoyl ACP-reductase catalyzes the final step in each cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antimicrobial agents. Molecular docking into active site of enoyl ACP-reductase was performed on 2H7M.PDB and 4JX8.PDB files to understand ligand-protein interactions. The compounds obtained from the present research can be used as scaffolds in fragment-based design of new potent drugs.

"The biosynthesis of nanoparticles has been proposed as a cost effective environmental friendly alternative to chemical and physical methods. Microbial synthesis of nanoparticles is under exploration due to wide biomedical applications, research interest in nanotechnology and microbial biotechnology. In the present study, an ecofriendly process for the synthesis of nanoparticles using a novel Nocardiopsis sp. MBRC-1 has been attempted. We used culture supernatant of Nocardiopsis sp. MBRC-1 for the simple and cost effective green synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The reduction of silver ions occurred when silver nitrate solution was treated with the Nocardiopsis sp. MBRC-1 culture supernatant at room temperature. The nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible, TEM, FE-SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD spectroscopy. The nanoparticles exhibited an absorption peak around 420 nm, a characteristic surface plasmon resonance band of silver nanoparticles. They were spherical in shape with an average particle size of 45 + 0.15 nm. The EDX analysis showed the presence of elemental silver signal in the synthesized nanoparticles. The FTIR analysis revealed that the protein component in the form of enzyme nitrate reductase produced by the isolate in the culture supernatant may be responsible for reduction and as capping agents. The XRD spectrum showed the characteristic Bragg peaks of 1 2 3, 2 0 4, 0 4 3, 1 4 4, and 3 1 1 facets of the face centered cubic silver nanoparticles and confirms that these nanoparticles are crystalline in nature. The prepared silver nanoparticles exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi. Cytotoxicity of biosynthesized AgNPs against in vitro human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) showed a dose-response activity. IC50 value was found to be 200 mu g/mL of AgNPs against HeLa cancer cells. Further studies are needed to elucidate the toxicity and the mechanism involved with antimicrobial and anticancer activity of the synthesized AgNPs as nanomedicine.",0
"Sedimentary habitats show large variation in physical and ecological conditions that can influence microbial abundance and composition. Such variation can place resident organisms under different risks of microbial infestation and thereby select for different levels of antimicrobial defense. The egg masses deposited by a diversity of marine organisms in these environments may be especially vulnerable to microbial colonization. Previous studies have demonstrated interspecific variation in the level of anti-microbial activity in egg masses, but have not examined whether intraspecific variation among populations relates to variation in risks among habitats. We compared anti-bacterial activity in egg masses among populations of the opisthobranch mollusc Melanochlamys diomedea in relation to sediment features, including bacterial load, particle size, and organic content. Egg masses were extracted with ethyl acetate and methanol to derive fractions with relatively low and high polarity, respectively. The extracts were then tested in a bacterial growth assay for anti-microbial activity against the bacteria Vibrio harveyi and Bacillus subtilis. Sediment characteristics and bacterial load were all highly correlated and varied significantly among sites, with organic content appearing to be a stronger predictor of bacterial load than sediment size. Among populations, the level of anti-bacterial activity within egg masses also correlated as expected with these sediment characteristics and with bacterial load. These results support the hypothesis that anti-microbial defenses in egg masses are related to the environmental risks of microbial exposure. Thus, microbial interactions appear to drive an important component of the reproductive biology of sediment-dwelling organisms.",0
"Infectious diseases and increasing antibiotic resistance among diverse classes of microbes are global health concerns and a prime focus of omics systems science applications in novel drug discovery. Plumbagin is a plant-derived naphthoquinone, a natural product that exhibits antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial effects of plumbagin against Bacillus subtilis using two complementary proteomics techniques: two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). Comparative quantitative proteomics analysis of plumbagin treated and untreated control samples identified differential expression of 230 proteins (1% FDR, 1.5 fold-change and >= 2 peptides) in B. subtilis after plumbagin treatment. Pathway analysis involving the differentially expressed proteins suggested that plumbagin effectively increases heme and protein biosynthesis, whereas fatty acid synthesis was significantly reduced. Gene expression and metabolic activity assays further corroborated the proteomics findings. We anticipate that plumbagin blocks the cell division by altering the membrane permeability required for energy generation. This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, offering new insights, at proteome level, for the putative mode(s) of action of plumbagin and attendant cellular targets in B. subtilis. The findings also suggest new ways forward for the modern omics-guided drug target discovery, building on traditional plant medicine.",0
"Isolate TEB1 an antagonistic endophytic bacterium, obtained from citrus leaves and identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens by 16S rDNA sequencing, was used for the biological control of mal secco disease of Citrus aurantium seedlings caused by the mitosporic fungus Phoma tracheiphila. The isolate TEB1 exhibited a good in vitro activity against P. tracheiphila in dual cultures as well as with the well diffusion method. C. aurantium seedlings watered with a suspension of TEB1 cells showed a reduction of 53.61 and 48.63 % in disease severity and incidence, respectively. A PCR test with specific primers was performed 365 days after inoculation and P. tracheiphila was detected along the whole stem in inoculated control plant while no amplification product was obtained in TEB1 treated seedlings. Molecular analysis of TEB1 revealed a positive amplification of fenD and ituC genes responsible of the biosynthesis of fengycin and iturin lipopeptides, respectively. Moreover, observations by optical microscope showed that TEB1 reduced by 55 % the germination of P. tracheiphila conidia and exhibited a marked effect on mycelia structure. Data suggest that lipopeptides produced by the bacterium interact with the cytoplasmic membrane of the fungus causing pore formation. TEB1 appears a potential candidate for the biological control of citrus mal secco disease.",0
"Endophytes play an important role in protection of host plants from infection by phytopathogens. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from five different parts (root, stem, petiole, leaf and seed) of Panax notoginseng and evaluated for antagonistic activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Ralstonia sp. and Meloidogyne hapla, three major pathogens associated with root-rot disease complex of P. notoginseng. From 1000 endophytic bacterial strains evaluated in vitro, 104 strains exhibited antagonistic properties against at least one of these three pathogens. Phylogenetic analyses of their 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that these 104 antagonistic bacteria belong to four clusters: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi. Members of the Firmicutes, in particular the Bacillus spp., were predominant in all analyzed tissues. The root was the main reservoir for antagonistic bacteria. Of the 104 antagonists, 51 strains showed antagonistic activities to one pathogen only, while 43 and 10 displayed the activities towards two and all three pathogens, respectively. The most dominant species in all tissues were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum and Bacillus methylotrophicus, which were represented by eight strains with broad antagonistic spectrum to the all three test pathogens of root-rot disease complex of P. notoginseng.",0
"In this research, endogenous antagonistic bacteria which can effectively inhibit the growth of soft rot pathogen were screened from konjac tissues. Fifteen endogenous bacteria strains were screened by means of tissue method. Five strains were confirmed to have resistance to soft rot disease, three (BS-4, 5, 8) of which were observed with relatively bigger bacteriostasis circles, with diameter of 14-16 mm. The inoculation of pathogen on konjac corm indicated that the fermentation supernatant of BS-8, a strain with relatively higher inhibitory activity, could inhibit the infection of soft rot. The strain was identified as a kind of Bacillus subtilis by means of the analysis of physiology and biochemistry and 16S rRNA gene sequence. The BS-8 strain exhibits an obvious antagonism on soft rot pathogen and can be served as a novel plant biocontrol agent or engineering bacterium for further study.",0
"Bacteriocins are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, which have been found in diverse bacterial species of terrestrial origins and some from the sea. New bacteriocins with new characteristics, new origins and new applications are likely still awaiting discovery. The present study screened bacteria isolated from marine animals of interest to the aquaculture industry for antimicrobial and bacteriocin-like activities in order to uncover biodiversity of bacteriocin producers, and explore the potential application in aquaculture. In total, 24 of 100 screened isolates showed antimicrobial activities and 7 of these exerted bacteriocin-like activities. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes identified the isolates as members of the six genera Proteus, Providencia, Klebsiella, Alcaligenes, Bacillus and Enterococcus. In some cases, further analysis of housekeeping genes, rpoB for Proteus and recA for Klebsiella, as well as biochemical tests was necessary for identification to species level, and some of the Proteus isolates may represent novel species. The seven bacteriocinogenic isolates showed a wide antimicrobial spectrum against foodborne and animal pathogens, which opens the way to their potential use as marine drugs and probiotics in food, aquaculture, livestock and clinical settings. As a case study, the protective effect of shortlisted bacteriocinogenic isolates were tested in aquaculture-raised spiny lobster (Panulirus ornatus) juveniles. A single-strain (Bacillus pumilus B3.10.2B) and a three-strain (B. pumilus B3.10.2B, Bacillus cereus D9, Lactobacillus plantarum T13) probiotic preparation were added to the feed of Panulirus ornatus juveniles, which were subsequently challenged with the pathogen Vibrio owensii DY05. juveniles in the probiotic treatments displayed increased growth and reduced feed conversion rates after 60 days, and increased survival rate after pathogen challenge relative to the control. This study represents the first evidence of bacteriocin production by bacteria associated with lobster, tiger shrimp, snubnose pompano and cobia and the first description of V. owensii as a pathogen in P. ornatus juveniles.

"Background: The Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain represents a ubiquitous structural fold that is involved in bacterial sensing and adaptation systems, including several virulence related functions. Although PAS domains and the subclass of PhoQ-DcuS-CitA (PDC) domains have a common structure, there is limited amino acid sequence similarity. To gain greater insight into the evolution of PDC/PAS domains present in the bacterial kingdom and staphylococci in specific, the PDC/PAS domains from the genomic sequences of 48 bacteria, representing 5 phyla, were identified using the sensitive search method based on HMM-to-HMM comparisons (HHblits). Results: A total of 1,007 PAS domains and 686 PDC domains distributed over 1,174 proteins were identified. For 28 Gram-positive bacteria, the distribution, organization, and molecular evolution of PDC/PAS domains were analyzed in greater detail, with a special emphasis on the genus Staphylococcus. Compared to other bacteria the staphylococci have relatively fewer proteins (6-9) containing PDC/PAS domains. As a general rule, the staphylococcal genomes examined in this study contain a core group of seven PDC/PAS domain-containing proteins consisting of WalK, SrrB, PhoR, ArlS, HssS, NreB, and GdpP. The exceptions to this rule are: 1) S. saprophyticus lacks the core NreB protein; 2) S. carnosus has two additional PAS domain containing proteins; 3) S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and S. pseudintermedius have an additional protein with two PDC domains that is predicted to code for a sensor histidine kinase; 4) S. lugdunensis has an additional PDC containing protein predicted to be a sensor histidine kinase. Conclusions: This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that variation in PDC/PAS domains among bacteria has limited correlations to the genome size or pathogenicity; however, our analysis established that bacteria having a motile phase in their life cycle have significantly more PDC/PAS-containing proteins. In addition, our analysis revealed a tremendous amount of variation in the number of PDC/PAS-containing proteins within genera. This variation extended to the Staphylococcus genus, which had between 6 and 9 PDC/PAS proteins and some of these appear to be previously undescribed signaling proteins. This latter point is important because most staphylococcal proteins that contain PDC/PAS domains regulate virulence factor synthesis or antibiotic resistance.",0
"CsrA/RsmA homologs are an extensive family of ribonucleic acid (RNA)-binding proteins that function as global post-transcriptional regulators controlling important cellular processes such as secondary metabolism, motility, biofilm formation and the production and secretion of virulence factors in diverse bacterial species. While direct messenger RNA binding by CsrA/RsmA has been studied in detail for some genes, it is anticipated that there are numerous additional, as yet undiscovered, direct targets that mediate its global regulation. To assist in the discovery of these targets, we propose a sequence-based approach to predict genes directly regulated by these regulators. In this work, we develop a computer code (CSRA_TARGET) implementing this approach, which leads to predictions for several novel targets in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The predicted targets in other bacteria, specifically Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Pectobacterium carotovorum and Legionella pneumophila, also include global regulators that control virulence in these pathogens, unraveling intricate indirect regulatory roles for CsrA/RsmA. We have experimentally validated four predicted RsmA targets in P. aeruginosa. The sequence-based approach developed in this work can thus lead to several testable predictions for direct targets of CsrA homologs, thereby complementing and accelerating efforts to unravel global regulation by this important family of proteins.",0
"Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is an important human pathogen. Natural genetic transformation, which was discovered in this species, involves internalization of exogenous single-stranded DNA and its incorporation into the chromosome. It allows acquisition of pathogenicity islands and antibiotic resistance and promotes vaccine escape via capsule switching. This opinion article discusses how recent advances regarding several facets of pneumococcal transformation support the view that the process has evolved to maximize plasticity potential in this species, making the pneumococcus le transformiste of the bacterial kingdom and providing an advantage in the constant struggle between this pathogen and its host.",0
"Staphylococcus aureus capsule is an important virulence factor that is regulated by a large number of regulators. Capsule genes are expressed from a major promoter upstream of the cap operon. A 10-bp inverted repeat (IR) located 13 bp upstream of the -35 region of the promoter was previously shown to affect capsule gene transcription. However, little is known about transcriptional activation of the cap promoter. To search for potential proteins which directly interact with the cap promoter region (Pcap), we directly analyzed the proteins interacting with the Pcap DNA fragment from shifted gel bands identified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. One of these regulators, RbsR, was further characterized and found to positively regulate cap gene expression by specifically binding to the cap promoter region. Footprinting analyses showed that RbsR protected a DNA region encompassing the 10-bp IR. Our results further showed that rbsR was directly controlled by SigB and that RbsR was a repressor of the rbsUDK operon, involved in ribose uptake and phosphorylation. The repression of rbsUDK by RbsR could be derepressed by D-ribose. However, D-ribose did not affect RbsR activation of capsule. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen which produces a large number of virulence factors. We have been using capsule as a model virulence factor to study virulence regulation. Although many capsule regulators have been identified, the mechanism of regulation of most of these regulators is unknown. We show here that RbsR activates capsule by direct promoter binding and that SigB is required for the expression of rbsR. These results define a new pathway wherein SigB activates capsule through RbsR. Our results further demonstrate that RbsR inhibits the rbs operon involved in ribose utilization, thereby providing an example of coregulation of metabolism and virulence in S. aureus. Thus, this study further advances our understanding of staphylococcal virulence regulation.",0
"Novel Schiff bases of N-substituted isatin, 1-13, were synthesized starting from isatin and N-(4-amino-2-methylphenyl)-4-chlorophthalimide and their structures were confirmed by spectral and elemental analyses. All new compounds were tested for their in vitro antibacterial activity against a range of Gram +ve bacterial strains, like Bacillus subtilis (NCIM-2156), Staphylococcus aureus (NCIM-2079) and Staphylococcus epidermis (NCIM-2493) and Gram -ve bacterial strains, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NCIM-2036), Escherichia coli (NCIM-2065) and Proteus vulgaris (NCIM-2027) following broth dilution method as recommended by the National Committee for clinical laboratory standards using ciprofloxacin as reference. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and zone of inhibition showed that the molecules were more active against Gram -ve bacteria than Gram +ve bacteria. The compounds showed promising antibacterial properties with MIC ranging between 10 and 30 mu g/mL.",0
"Copper(II) complexes of new aryldisulfonamides (L (1) = N,N'-bis[(2-methylphenyl)sulfonyl]ethylenediamine) and L (2) = N,N'-propanediyl-bis-benzenesulfonamide with 1,10-phenanthroline have been synthesized and characterized by using elemental analyses, FT-IR, LCMS, conductivity, and magnetic susceptibility techniques. The structures of [Cu(phen)(2)]L-1 (1) and [CuL2(phen)(2)] (2) compounds have been determined. Complex (1) has also been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The complex (1) crystallizes in the triclinic system, space group P1, with cell constants a = 12.9353(8) , b = 13.8543(9) , c = 14.4513(10) , alpha = 103.593(5)A degrees, beta A = 113.713(5)A degrees, gamma A = 106.104(5)A degrees, and Z = 1. The antibacterial activities of synthesized compounds were studied against Gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and B. cereus and Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Yersinia enterocolitica by microdilution (as MICs in mu g/mL) and disk diffusion (as diameter zone in mm) method. The biological activity screening showed that (1) has more activity than (2) against the tested bacteria.",0
"Rhizosphere microorganisms in soils are important for plant growth. However, the importance of rhizosphere microorganisms is still underestimated since many microorganisms associated with plant roots cannot be cultured and since the microbial diversity in the rhizosphere can be influenced by several factors, such as the cropping history, biogeography, and agricultural practice. Here, we characterized the rhizosphere bacterial diversity of cucumber plants grown in soils covering a wide range of cucumber cropping histories and environmental conditions by using pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. We also tested the effects of compost addition and/or bacterial inoculation on the bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere. We identified an average of approximately 8,883 reads per sample, corresponding to around 4,993 molecular operational taxonomic units per sample. The Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in almost all soils. The abundances of the phyla Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia varied among the samples, and together with Proteobacteria, these phyla were the six most abundant phyla in almost all analyzed samples. Analyzing all the sample libraries together, the predominant genera found were Flavobacterium, Ohtaekwangia, Opitutus, Gp6, Steroidobacter, and Acidovorax. Overall, compost and microbial amendments increased shoot biomass when compared to untreated soils. However, compost addition decreased the bacterial alpha-diversity in most soils (but for three soils compost increased diversity), and no statistical effect of microbial amendment on the bacterial alpha-diversity was found. Moreover, soil amendments did not significantly influence the bacterial beta-diversity. Soil organic content appeared more important than compost and microbial amendments in shaping the structure of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of cucumber.",0
"We present the draft whole-genome sequence of the entomopathogenic Bacillus pumilus 15.1 strain that consists of 3,795,691 bp and 3,776 predicted protein-coding genes.

"Introduction: A new method for preparation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) based on using hydrazino-isatin derivatives in an aqueous methanol reaction medium is reported here. AgNPs were prepared using silver nitrate solubilized in a water core as the source of silver ions and 3-hydrazino-isatin derivatives (3-hydrazino-isatin [IsH] and 1-benzyl-3-hydrazino-isatin [BIsH]) solubilized in methanol core as a reducing agent. The proposed method is effective, rapid, and convenient. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used for characterization of the AgNPs. The TEM micrographs confirmed that the nanopowders consist of well-dispersed agglomerates of grains with a narrow size distribution of 18-21 nm and 17-20 nm. The AgNPs, as well as BIsH, showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity against the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Micrococcus luteus and Proteus vulgaris, as well as antifungal activities against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On the other hand, they were not effective against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Purpose: A simple, effective, rapid, and convenient chemical reduction method for the synthesis of AgNPs in an aqueous methanol reaction medium using hydrazino-isatin derivatives and studying their antibacterial effect. Results: IsH and BIsH are remarkably powerful reductants for Ag+ ions in an aqueous methanol medium, which could be considered as a simple chemical reduction method for formation of AgNPs. The AgNP formation depends on the solubility of the hydrazino-isatin derivatives. BIsH gave more AgNPs than IsH, as observed from XRD. The formation of AgNPs is attributed to the adsorption of hydrazine derivatives and/or interparticle interaction on the surface of AgNP through electrostatic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the hydrazino group (C= N-NH2) and the positive surface of AgNPs. AgNPs and BIsH showed high antimicrobial and bacterial activity. Conclusion: In summary, it is shown that IsH and BIsH are remarkably powerful reductants for Ag+ ions in an aqueous methanol medium. BIsH gave more AgNPs than IsH, as observed from XRD due to better solubility of the BIsH than IsH in aqueous-methanol. The formation of AgNPs is attributed to the adsorption of hydrazine derivatives and/or interparticle interaction on the surface of AgNPs through electrostatic interactions between the lone pair electrons of the hydrazino group (C= N-NH2) and the positive surface of AgNPs. The AgNps as well as BIsH ligand showed high antimicrobial and bactericidal activity.",0
"[Objective] We isolated actinomyces from the termitarium and studied its metabolites to find the antimicrobial compounds. [Methods] We determined the taxonomic status of target strain BYC 01 by morphological observation and 16s rRNA sequence analysis. Growth rate method and agar disc diffusion assays were used to test the antimicrobial activities. Fermentation product was isolated and purified by various chromatographic methods, and the structure was determined by mass spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. [Results] BYC 01 was identified as Streptomyces violaceoruber. The main antimicrobial ingredients of BYC 01 fermentation broth consisted in the ethyl acetate fraction of moderate polar part. The ethyl acetate extract of BYC 01 had strong antifungal activities against Valsa mali with inhibition rate of more than 90%, and activities against Rhizoctonia solani and Dothiorella gregaria with inhibition rate of more than 60% under the concentration of 100 mu g/mL. Furthermore, the extract showed the intermediate antimicrobial activities against Candida albicans, Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Xanthomonas oryzae with the mean halo diameters ranging from 11. 3 to 16. 5 mm under the concentration of 30 mu g/filter paper. A monomer compound was purified from the fermentation products, and was identified as fogacin on the basis of mass spectrum and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. The compound fogacin and the positive control had similar antimicrobial activities against C. albicans with inhibition zone of 19. 3 mm and 20. 1 mm under the concentration of 30 mu g/filter paper. [Conclusion] Strain BYC 01 could be potentially developed as a new antimicrobial agent.",0
A novel series of eleven 4-(4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)phenyl)-6-arylpyrimidin-2-amines has been prepared from synthesized 3-[4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) phenyl]prop-2-en-1-ones and evaluated for phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition and antimicrobial activities. N-arylation of imidazole with 4-fluorobenzaldehyde using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as catalyst gave 4-(1H-imidazol-1-yl) benzaldehyde which on treatment with substituted acetophenones yielded corresponding chalcones (1a-1k). Each chalcone on further reaction with guanidine hydrochloride resulted in title compounds (2a-2k). Pyrimidines thus synthesized were subjected to biological studies. Some compounds showed marked activities in PDE inhibition and anti-bacterial and anti-fungal bioassays.,0
"Various strategies can be used to deliver antigens to the cytosol of antigen presenting cells, e.g. using nanoparticles, liposomes, immune stimulating complexes, viruses or bacteria. Among them, the use of bacterial carriers constitutes probably the most studied strategy. Depending on the extra- or intracellular life cycle of the pathogen, different immune responses are required for protection. Vaccines formulated on the basis of killed whole cells or isolated cell fractions tend to induce strong antibody response, however, they are ineffective at inducing cellular immunity. Due to these characteristics such antigens are used mainly to immunize against extracellular pathogens. Conversely, live attenuated mutants induce a broad range of immune responses including CD8(+) T cell response, thereby leading to effective immunization against intracellular pathogens. Besides adjuvant properties provided by carried molecular patterns, live bacterial carriers have other important advantages, such as the ability to mimic natural infection and possibility to be administered in a needle-free manner. Remarkably, vector-based vaccines can be designed to enable induction of immune response against their own or carried heterologous antigens. Both pathogenic and commensal microorganisms are used in the next generation vaccine design, however, due to the potential risk of conversion to a virulent strain and causing infection or the loss of immunogenic potency, pathogenic vectors are less likely to use. Questions concerning safety which have arisen with the advent of live-attenuated bacterial vectors made the researchers turn their attention to non-pathogenic bacteria.",0
"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of clindamycin and metronidazole to synergize with natural antimicrobials against biofilms of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated Gardnerella vaginalis. Minimum bactericidal concentrations for biofilm cells (MBCs-B) were determined for each antimicrobial. The MBCs-B of lauramide arginine ethyl ester (LAE), subtilosin, clindamycin and metronidazole were 50, 69.5, 20 and 500 mug mL(-1), respectively. A checkerboard assay and isobologram were used to analyze the type of interactions between these antimicrobials. The combination of metronidazole with natural antimicrobials did not inhibit planktonic lactobacilli. Clindamycin with either LAE or with subtilosin was inhibitory for planktonic but not for biofilm-associated lactobacilli. All tested antimicrobial combinations were inhibitory for BV-associated Mobiluncus curtisii and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. LAE and subtilosin synergized with clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of G. vaginalis but not biofilm-associated vaginal lactobacilli. The biofilms of BV-associated pathogens can be controlled by synergistically acting combinations of conventional antibiotics and natural antimicrobials which will help better management of current antibiotics, especially considering robust bacterial resistance. Our findings create a foundation for a new strategy in the effective control of vaginal infections.",0
"A widespread bacterium Serratia marcescens (family Enterobacteriaceae) is an opportunistic pathogen and exhibits multiple drug resistance. Active removal of antibiotics and other antimicrobials from the cells by efflux systems is one of the mechanisms responsible for microbial resistance to these compounds. Among enterobacteria, efflux systems of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium have been studied most extensively. Few efflux systems that belong to different families have been reported for S. marcescens. In this review, we analyzed available literature about S. marcescens efflux systems and carried out the comparative analysis of the genes encoding the RND type systems in different Serratia species and in other enterobacteria. Bioinformatical analysis of the S. marcescens genome allowed us to identify the previously unknown efflux systems based on their homology with the relevant E. coli genes. Identification of additional efflux systems in S. marcescens genome will promote our understanding of the physiology of these bacteria, will detect new molecular mechanisms of resistance, and will reveal their resistance potential.",0
"The 4-(o-methoxyphenyl)-2 aminothiazole was synthesized by reacting o-methoxyacetophenone, iodine, and thiourea; and characterized by spectral UV-Visible, Infra-Red (IR), H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance, (CNMR)-N-13, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and thermal analyses. From the thermo gravimetric-differential thermal analysis curve, various kinetic parameters like order of reaction (n), energy of activation (E), pre-exponential factor (Z), entropy of activation (Delta S), and free energy change (G) have been calculated using Coats-Redfern, MacCallum-Tanner, and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The compound was evaluated for antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis 2063 and Escherichia coli 2931, and its mechanism of action was studied by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. A novel functional application of MPAT, a quorum sensing mediated inhibition of biofilm was studied in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is hitherto un-attempted.",0
"This study compared the antimicrobial activity and total phenolic content of three Pinus plants (Pinus densiflora, P. thunbergii, P. rigida) for the first time. The antimicrobial activity of the water fraction of methanol extract of fresh leaves was stronger than that of fallen leaves at any concentrations. The water fraction of crude methanol extract from fresh leaves of P. thunbergii showed a higher growth inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria than that of P. densiflora and P. rigida. The results from the disc diffusion method followed by measurements of minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) indicate that Bacillus subtilis was the most sensitive microorganism with the lowest MIC value. The highest total phenolic content was found in fresh leaves of P. rigida and P. thunbergii. The assay showed that the fresh leaves of the three Pinus plants contained higher total phenolic content than fallen leaves of the three plants. The antimicrobial activity was related with the total phenolic content.",0
"Background: Epsilon is an antitoxin of the E/ toxin-antitoxin (TA) system family, which is widespread in pathogenic bacteria. Results:In vitro and in vivo degradation of the Epsilon protein is shown. Conclusion: ClpXP protease is responsible for the degradation of the Epsilon antitoxin. Significance: The first demonstration of in vitro degradation of the antitoxin from Gram-positive bacteria. Most bacterial genomes contain different types of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. The -E- proteinaceous type II TA cassette from the streptococcal pSM19035 plasmid is a member of the E/ family, which is commonly found in multiresistance plasmids and chromosomes of various human pathogens. Regulation of type II TA systems relies on the proteolysis of antitoxin proteins. Under normal conditions, the Epsilon antidote neutralizes the Zeta toxin through the formation of a tight complex. In this study, we show, using both in vivo and in vitro analyses, that the ClpXP protease is responsible for Epsilon antitoxin degradation. Using in vivo studies, we examined the stability of the plasmids with active or inactive -E- TA cassettes in B. subtilis mutants that were defective for different proteases. Using in vitro assays, the degradation of purified His(6)-Epsilon by the His(6)-Lon(Bs), ClpP(Bs), and ClpX(Bs) proteases from B. subtilis was analyzed. Additionally, we showed that purified Zeta toxin protects the Epsilon protein from rapid ClpXP-catalyzed degradation.",0
"The search for small molecules capable of inhibiting transcription initiation in bacteria has resulted in the synthesis of N,N'-disubstituted hydrazines and imine-carbohydrazides comprised of indole, pyridine, pyrrole, furan and thiophene using the respective trichloroacetyl derivatives, carbohydrazides and aldehydes. Replacement of the indole moiety by smaller heterocycles linked by -CO-NH-N=C- linkers afforded a broad variety of compounds efficiently targeting the RNA polymerase-sigma(70)/sigma(A) interaction as determined by ELISA and exhibiting increased inhibition of the growth of Escherichia coli compared to Bacillus subtilis in culture. The structural features of the synthesized transcription initiation inhibitors needed for antibacterial activity were identified employing molecular modelling and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies.

Current and future bacterial protease targets are described and their limitations outlined.",0
"In the last decade regulatory RNAs have emerged as powerful tools to regulate the expression of genes both in prokaryotes and in eukaryotes. RNases, by degrading these RNA molecules, control the right amount of regulatory RNAs, which is fundamental for an accurate regulation of gene expression in the cell. Remarkably the first antisense RNAs identified were plasmid-encoded and their detailed study was crucial for the understanding of prokaryotic antisense RNAs. In this review we highlight the role of RNases in the precise modulation of antisense RNAs that control plasmid replication, maintenance and transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Today the use of silver nanoparticles is becoming increasingly widespread due to their wide applications as antimicrobial agent. Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) using the petal extract of saffron (Crocus sativus) as a reducing agent from 5 mM AgNO3 has been investigated in this work. Diverse petal extracts quantities and reaction times were used for the synthesis of SNPs. The resulting SNPs were characterized by means of UV-Vis, XRD and FTIR techniques. SNPs were synthesized rapidly within 30 min of incubation period and synthesized SNPs showed an absorption peak at 380-400 nm in the UV-Vis spectrum. XRD spectrum confirmed the formation of metallic silver, too. Green synthesized SNPs were used as antimicrobial agent against three bacterial genera of Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter which contaminate preservative solution of cut-flowers, too. According to the results biosynthesized SNPs using saffron petals successfully controlled these bacteria and have made them promising candidates as new generation of antimicrobials. This route is rapid, simple without any hazardous chemicals and economical to synthesized SNPs.",0
"Aeromonas species are common inhabitants of aquatic environments and relevant as human pathogens. Their potential as pathogens may be related in part to lateral transfer of genes associated with toxin production, biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and other virulence determinants. Natural transformation has not been characterized in aeromonads. DNA from wild-type, prototrophic strains that had been isolated from environmental sources was used as donor DNA in transformation assays with auxotrophs as the recipients. Competence was induced in 20% nutrient broth during the stationary phase of growth. Optimal transformation assay conditions for one chosen isolate were in Tris buffer with magnesium or calcium, pH 5-8, and a saturating concentration of 0.5 mu g of DNA per assay (3.3 ng of DNA mu l(-1)) at 30 C. Sodium was also required and could not be replaced with ammonium, potassium, or lithium. The maximal transformation frequency observed was 1.95 x 10(-3) transformants (recipient cell)(-1). A survey of environmental Aeromonas auxotrophic recipients (n = 37), assayed with donor DNA from other wild-type environmental aeromonads under optimal assay conditions, demonstrated that 73% were able to act as recipients, and 100% were able to act as donors to at least some other aeromonads. Three different transformation groups were identified based on each isolates' ability to transform other strains with its DNA. The transformation groups roughly corresponded to phylogenetic groups. These results demonstrate that natural transformation is a general property of Aeromonas environmental isolates with implications for the genetic structures of coincident Aeromonas populations.

"Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC)/Sodium alginate (SA) blends have been prepared by casting solution method. The effect of different irradiation doses (2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 kGy) of gamma rays on the physical properties of the CMC/SA blend containing different ratios of SA (20, 30, and 40 %) such as gel fraction (%) and swelling (%) of CMC/SA blends were investigated. It was found that the gel fraction increases with increasing irradiation dose up to 20 kGy while the swelling of CMC/SA blend films tends to increase with increasing SA content and reduced with increasing irradiation doses. Mechanical and thermal properties of the blend films were improved when CMC content increased and with increasing irradiation dose up to 20 kGy. Morphology of the blend was examined by SEM, which indicates compatibility between CMC and SA. The blend rich in SA content possessed good antimicrobial activity against Gram +ve Bacteria (Bacillus subtilis).",0
"Trivalent lanthanide complexes of the type [Ln(L)CI(H2O)(2)] (where Ln = Nd(III) or Sm(III) and LH2 = Schiff bases derived by the condensation of 3-(phenyl/substitutedphenyI)-4-amino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole with diacetyl/benzil) have been synthesized by the reactions of anhydrous lanthanide(III) chloride with Schiff bases in methanol. The structures of the complexes have been proposed on the basis of elemental analysis, electrical conductance, magnetic moment, spectroscopic measurements (IR, H-1, C-13 NMR and UV-vis spectra) and X-ray diffraction studies. The spectral data reveal that the Schiff base ligands behave as dibasic tetradentate chelating agents having coordination sites at two thiol sulfur atoms and two azomethine nitrogen atoms. The presence of coordinated water in metal complexes was confirmed by thermal and IR data of the complexes. All the Schiff bases and their metal complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger, Curvularia pallescens and Colletotrichurn capsici.

"How populations of growing cells achieve cell-size homeostasis remains a major question in cell biology. Recent studies in rod-shaped bacteria support the ""incremental rule"" where each cell adds a constant length before dividing. Although this rule explains narrow cell-size distributions, its mechanism is still unknown. We show that the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa obeys the incremental rule to achieve cell-length homeostasis during exponential growth but shortens its cells when entering the stationary phase. We identify a mutant, called frik, which has increased antibiotic sensitivity, cells that are on average longer, and a fraction of filamentous cells longer than 10 mu m. When growth slows due to entry in stationary phase, the distribution of frik cell sizes decreases and approaches wild-type length distribution. The rare filamentous cells have abnormally large nucleoids, suggesting that a deficiency in DNA segregation prevents cell division without slowing the exponential elongation rate.",0
"Five trials were carried out under greenhouse conditions to test the efficacy of spray programmes based on biocontrol agents, phosphite-based fertilizers and a chemical inducer of resistance (acibenzolar-S-methyl, phosethyl-Al) to control crown and root rot of tomato incited by Phytophthora nicotianae. The best disease control, under high disease pressure resulting from artificial inoculation, was obtained with three pre-plant leaf sprays at 7 d intervals with acibenzolar-S-methyl and with two mineral phosphite-based fertilizers. The disease reduction achieved was similar to that obtained with a single application of azoxystrobin and metalaxyl-M. Phosetyl-Al and the biocontrol agents Glomus spp. + Bacillus megaterium + Trichoderma, B. subtilis QST713, B. velezensis IT45 and the mixture T. asperellum ICC012 + T. gamsii ICC080 provided a partial disease control. Brassica carinata pellets did not control the disease.",0
"Bacillus subtilis and other Bacilli have long been used as biological control agents against plant bacterial diseases but the mechanisms by which the bacteria confer protection are not well understood. Our goal in this study was to isolate strains of B.subtilis that exhibit high levels of biocontrol efficacy from natural environments and to investigate the mechanisms by which these strains confer plant protection. We screened a total of 60 isolates collected from various locations across China and obtained six strains that exhibited above 50% biocontrol efficacy on tomato plants against the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum under greenhouse conditions. These wild strains were able to form robust biofilms both in defined medium and on tomato plant roots and exhibited strong antagonistic activities against various plant pathogens in plate assays. We show that plant protection by those strains depended on widely conserved genes required for biofilm formation, including regulatory genes and genes for matrix production. We provide evidence suggesting that matrix production is critical for bacterial colonization on plant root surfaces. Finally, we have established a model system for studies of B.subtilistomato plant interactions in protection against a plant pathogen.",0
"Black Sigatoka disease caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet is the most devastating disease of bananas worldwide. Its management is reliant on protectant and systemic fungicides despite their environmental concerns. This study evaluated the effect of a microbial fungicide (MF) based on Bacillus subtilis EA-CB0015 and its metabolites for the control of black Sigatoka disease on banana plants in greenhouse and field conditions. The MF applied at 1.5 L/ha and 3.0 L/ha provided control of the disease comparable to the protectant fungicide chlorothalonil in greenhouse. In the field, the MF applied in solution with water at 0.15 L/ha and 1.5 L/ha every 11 days during 10 weeks reduced black Sigatoka disease severity in 20.2% and 28.1% respectively; reductions comparable to those obtained with the protectant fungicides chlorothalonil (1.5 L/ha) and mancozeb (3.8 L/ha). The MF incorporated into different programs with systemic fungicides reduced disease level up to 42.9% with no significant differences with the conventional program. To determine which component of the MF is responsible for the activity against Mycosphaerella fijiensis, greenhouse and in vitro tests were set up to evaluate individually the spores, vegetative cells and secondary metabolites of Bacillus subtilis EA-CB0015. All components reduced the severity of the disease and the germination of ascospores. For both trials the activity of the metabolites was higher and comparable to the activity obtained with the MF, indicating that the efficacy of the MF depends mainly on the metabolites and in lesser extent to Bacillus subtilis EA-CB0015 cells.

"There is an urgent need for new antibiotics and alternative strategies to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens, which are a growing clinical issue. Repurposing existing approved drugs with known pharmacology and toxicology is an alternative strategy to accelerate antimicrobial research and development. In this study, we show that celecoxib, a marketed inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens from a variety of genera, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Listeria, Bacillus, and Mycobacterium, but not against Gram-negative pathogens. However, celecoxib is active against all of the Gram-negative bacteria tested, including strains of, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas, when their intrinsic resistance is artificially compromised by outer membrane permeabilizing agents such as colistin. The effect of celecoxib on incorporation of radioactive precursors into macromolecules in Staphylococcus aureus was examined. The primary antimicrobial mechanism of action of celecoxib was the dose-dependent inhibition of RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis. Further, we demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of celecoxib in a methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infected Caenorhabditis elegans whole animal model. Topical application of celecoxib (1 and 2%) significantly reduced the mean bacterial count in a mouse model of MRSA skin infection. Further, celecoxib decreased the levels of all inflammatory cytokines tested, including tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta, and monocyte chemo attractant protein-1 in wounds caused by MRSA infection. Celecoxib also exhibited synergy with many conventional antimicrobials when tested against four clinical isolates of S. aureus. Collectively, these results demonstrate that celecoxib alone, or in combination with traditional antimicrobials, has a potential to use as a topical drug for the treatment of bacterial skin infections.",0
"Bitter rot is an apple fruit disease most commonly caused in New Zealand by the fungus Colletotrichum acutatum. The timing of fungicide applications to manage this disease was investigated during two seasons. Fungicides applied during October (carbendazim), or November and December (tolyfluanid, captan and mancozeb), reduced incidence of rots expressing on trees in the orchard. Fungicides (half-strength copper oxychloride, Bacillus subtilis QST 713 and tolyfluanid) applied during January and February reduced the incidence of postharvest rots. Bacillus subtilis QST 713 applied regularly throughout the season reduced incidence of field rots, but was not effective when the number of applications was reduced. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) or copper oxychloride applied during November and December reduced the incidence of sprinkler rots caused by Phytophthora cactorum.",0
"In search of novel biologically active azoles, some new (E)-2-(3,5-dimethyl-4-(aryldiazenyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-arylthiazoles 3a-p have been synthesized via Hantzsch thiazole approach under greener, mild and solvent-free conditions. Structures of all compounds were established on the basis of the rigorous elemental analysis and their IR, NMR (H-1, C-13), COSY, ROSEY, HSQC and HMBC spectral data. To explore the biological potential, all the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial, antioxidant and UV-mediated DNA damage-protective and photocleavage activity. The results of antimicrobial study revealed that among the series, compounds 3g-l were found active selectively against C. albicans. The compound 3l exhibited twofold high antifungal potential in comparison with amphotericin-B, a standard drug against C. albicans. The compound 3k was found equipotent, and 3g-j displayed half of the potential in reference to the standard drug. In UV-induced DNA damage-protecting and photocleavage study, 3j and 3n were found as the most potent DNA damage-protecting and DNA-photocleaving agents, respectively, at 40 A mu g concentration. The compounds 3d, 3e, 3g, 3i, 3k, 3m and 3o also displayed a significant level of DNA damage-protective potential, whereas 3l and 3p exhibited appreciable DNA photocleavage activity. In the antioxidant study, all compounds were found inactive.",0
"In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacological and toxicological effects of Teucrium stocksianum. The crude extract of T. stocksianum (Ts center dot Cr) and its subsequent organic fractions: n-hexane (Ts.Hex), chloroform (Ts center dot CHCl3) and ethyl acetate (Ts center dot EtAc) exhibited 1,1-diphenyl,2-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity with different potencies. Ts center dot EtAc was found to be most potent. Ts center dot Cr, Ts center dot Hex, Ts center dot CHCl3 and Ts center dot EtAc showed significant bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus subtilis at their extent. Ts center dot Cr, Ts center dot Hex, Ts center dot CHCl3 and Ts.EtAc displayed fungicidal action against Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani at various minimum inhibitory concentrations. Ts center dot Cr and Ts center dot EtAc exhibited marked inhibition of Leishmania tro pica growth, observed after 48 and 96 hrs of treatment. These data indicate that the T. stocksianum methanolic extract and its resultant fractions possess antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and antileishmanial activities. Thus, the present research unearths the scientific base for T. stocksianum medicinal application as antioxidant and antimicrobial agents.",0
"HG1 is a Leu-rich antimicrobial peptide (AMP). Previously, the peptide was shown to lose its activity in human serum although it possessed potent and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against a wide range of pathogenic microbes. In an attempt to design an HG1 isomer that can overcome the problem of HG1, a structure-activity relationship study was conducted by substitution of each of five Leu residues with a Gln residue. Each substitute was tested for its antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or Candida strains. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of HG1 isomers was examined in the presence of glycosaminoglycans or lipid components occurring in the extracellular matrix, human serum and wound fluid. As a result, it was determined that the third residue (Leu) in the sequence of HG1 was mainly responsible for abrogation of its antimicrobial activity in human serum or wound fluid. An HG1 isomer (L3Q) with a Gln-3 substitution exhibited a potent antibacterial activity in 50% human serum. While the anti-MRSA activity of L3Q was equivalent to that of HG1, its anti-Candida activity was found to be substantially reduced. In order to improve anti-Candida activity of L3Q, its cationicity was enhanced by replacement of the C-terminal Ala-19 with a Lys residue. Overall, an HG1 isomer with two substitutions of Gln-3 and Lys-19, named haloganan, was verified to have an advantage over HG1 in that it exerted its potent antimicrobial activity under conditions containing human serum and/or wound fluid.

"The locus PA4991 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes an open reading frame that has been identified as essential for the virulence and/or survival of this pathogenic organism in the infected host. Here, it is shown that this gene encodes a monomeric FAD-binding protein of molecular mass 42.2 kDa. The structure of PA4991 was determined by a combination of molecular replacement using a search model generated with Rosetta and phase improvement by a low-occupancy heavy-metal derivative. PA4991 belongs to the GR(2) family of FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, comprising an FAD-binding domain typical of the glutathione reductase family and a second domain dominated by an eight-stranded mixed beta-sheet. Most of the protein-FAD interactions are via the FAD-binding domain, but the isoalloxazine ring is located at the domain interface and interacts with residues from both domains. A comparison with the structurally related glycine oxidase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase shows that in spite of very low amino-acid sequence identity (<18%) several active-site residues involved in substrate binding in these enzymes are conserved in PA4991. However, enzymatic assays show that PA4991 does not display amino-acid oxidase or glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, suggesting that it requires different substrates for activity.",0
"The imidazole fungicide miconazole (MCZ) and the antidepressant sertraline (SER) have the potential to adversely affect aquatic organisms when they are released into the environment. To assess if they could be broken down, MCZ and SER were treated with laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) from lignin-degrading white-rot fungi. The MnP-dependent lipid peroxidation system with Tween 80 containing unsaturated fatty acid was effective in eliminating MCZ and SER; the MnP-Tween 80 system helped eliminate 88% of MCZ and 85% of SER after 24 h of treatment. Furthermore, this system eliminated a metabolite of SER (desmethylsertraline or DSER), and no differences between the elimination rates of DSER and SER were observed throughout the treatment period. It was also confirmed that the MnP-Tween 80 system caused a complete loss of growth inhibition by MCZ of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and reduced the growth inhibition by SER of the green alga Pseudokirchneriella sub-capitate by 78% after 24 h of treatment. On the other hand, no appreciable elimination of MCZ and SER was obtained by treatment with laccase, MnP, or the laccase-mediator system with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Microbial expansins act on plant cell walls similarly to plant expansins, albeit their loosening activity levels are tenfold lesser compared to plant expansins. We report the characterization of an expansin-like gene from the plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum, named exl1. PcExl1 is an acidic protein that binds cellulose ( Avicel), and weakens filter paper. The acidic nature of PcExl1 confers different binding properties when compared to Bacillus subtilis BsEXLX1, which is a basic protein. PcExl1 binding to wheat cell wall increased when acidic components were depleted, reaching a similar level to the binding to Avicel, indicating that cellulose is the target of PcExl1.",0
"Melanization is a rapid defense mechanism in invertebrates. The substrate specificity of phenoloxidases (POs) and the role of melanization reaction products were investigated in the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. Two PmPOs (PmproPO1 and PrriproPO2) were found to display a substrate specificity towards monophenols and diphenols, and exhibit relatively weak activity against 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI). Systemic infection of the PmproPO1/2 co-silenced shrimp with the fungus, Fusarium solani, led to a significantly increased mortality, suggesting an important role of PmproPOs in shrimp's defense against fungal infection. Using L-DOPA, dopamine or DHI as a substrate, the melanization reaction products exhibited in vitro antimicrobial activities towards Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis), whereas the lower effect was detected against the fungus (F. solani). SEM analysis revealed the morphological changes and damage of cell membranes of V. harveyi and F. solani after treatment with shrimp melanization reaction products. Together, these findings demonstrate the crucial functions of the proPO system and the importance of melanization reaction products in the shrimp's immune defense. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"A series of novel derivatives of 1,3-oxazolidin-2-one 12a-12n has been synthesized starting from 4-nitro-(L)-phenylalanine by involving five-step reaction sequence. All the compounds were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacterial strains namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative) and in vitro antifungal activity against two pathogenic fungal strains namely, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All the synthesized compounds showed activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Compounds 12c and 12l exhibited maximum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. However, against Gram-negative bacteria only five of screened compounds were found to be active. Compounds 12c and 12i displayed best antifungal activity against the tested fungi. Docking studies were carried out in order to gain insight into the mechanism of action and the binding mode of these compounds. These studies were in agreement with the biological data.",0
"A new series of novel compounds [10-substituted 6H, 7H-indolo[2,3-c]isoquinolin-5-one-6-yl]carbohydrazides (3a-c), 1-[10-substituted 6H, 7H-indolo[2,3-c]isoquinolin-5-one-6-yl]fomyl-, -3',5'-dimethylpyrazoles (4a-c), -3',5'-diphenylpyrazoles (5a-c), -3'-methylpyrazol-5'-ones (6a-c) and -1',3',4'-oxidiazole-2'-thiones (7a-c) linked to indoloisoquinoline at position-6 through formyl bridge was prepared. The structures of these newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by their spectral studies and elemental analysis. These compounds have been screened for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Compounds 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b, 5c, 6b, 7a, and 7c exhibited the maximum zone of inhibition against A. niger, A. flavus, and A. fumigatus. Compounds 4a, 5a, 5c, 6b, 6c, 7a, and 7b showed good antibacterial activity. Compounds 4b, 4c, 5b, 5c, 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b, and 7c showed good radical scavenging activity compared with standards.",0
"Background: Antithrombin III (ATIII), an antiproteinase-inhibiting coagulation, was investigated for roles in host defense. Results: Extensive proteolysis of ATIII by endogenous and bacterial enzymes generated antimicrobial activity, mapped to helix D of the molecule. Conclusion: ATIII harbor cryptic host defense epitopes released during proteolysis. Significance: The results explain previously observed antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of ATIII supplementation during infection. Antithrombin III (ATIII) is a key antiproteinase involved in blood coagulation. Previous investigations have shown that ATIII is degraded by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, leading to release of heparin binding fragments derived from its D helix. As heparin binding and antimicrobial activity of peptides frequently overlap, we here set out to explore possible antibacterial effects of intact and degraded ATIII. In contrast to intact ATIII, the results showed that extensive degradation of the molecule yielded fragments with antimicrobial activity. Correspondingly, the heparin-binding, helix d-derived, peptide FFFAKLNCRLYRKANKSSKLV (FFF21) of human ATIII, was found to be antimicrobial against particularly the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy studies demonstrated that FFF21 binds to and permeabilizes bacterial membranes. Analogously, FFF21 was found to induce membrane leakage of model anionic liposomes. In vivo, FFF21 significantly reduced P. aeruginosa infection in mice. Additionally, FFF21 displayed anti-endotoxic effects in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest novel roles for ATIII-derived peptide fragments in host defense.",0
"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in plants and reside their hosts for a part of their life cycle. Their various diversity associated with the potential bioactivity has played an important role in human health, especially that from Chinese traditional medicinal herbs. Here, we isolated endophytic fungi from plant Curcuma wenyujin and evaluated their antimicrobial activity. Sixty-six endophytic fungi were recovered from the fresh and healthy root, leaf and stem tissues of C. wenyujin. Of these isolates, the common species Penicillium, Fusarium and Aspergillus were the dominant species. 65% of endophytic fungi had the potential antibacterial activity against one or more tested microorganism of E. coli, P. vulgaris, B. subtilis, S. aureus, Rhizopus, Microzyme, A. niger and Mucor, and 4.5% strains could inhibit eight tested microbes, exhibiting a broad antimicrobial spectrum. These findings provide a strong platform for the isolation and purification of natural antimicrobial agents from endophytic fungi of C. wenyujin.",0
"The inhibitory kinetics of furfuryl alcohol, furfural and furoic acid on mushroom tyrosinase have been investigated. The results showed that these furan compounds were reversible inhibitors of the enzyme. Furthermore, furfuryl alcohol and furfural were found to be mixed-type inhibitors while furoic acid is uncompetitive inhibitor. The inhibition constants have been confirmed and the order of the inhibiting ability was furfural > furoic acid > furfuryl alcohol. They indicate that the functional groups on the furan ring play a crucial role in the inhibition on the enzyme. In addition, it was also found that these furan compounds could inhibit the proliferation of Salmonella bacteria and Bacillus subtilis to different extents. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of furfuryl alcohol, furfural and furoic acid against B. subtilis and S. bacteria were 0.115, 0.027, 0.015 and 0.115, 0.029, 0.009 mu M, respectively. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of that were 0.115, 0.027, 0.015 and 0.231, 0.121, 0.030 mu M, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",0
"A putative source of inappropriate immune activation that drives human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 immunopathogenesis is the gastrointestinal tract. Even with effective antiretroviral treatment, residual activation persists. We hypothesized that an oral probiotic could improve the residual immune activation in chronic treated HIV-1 infection, and tested a Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 capsule probiotic in HIV-1-infected persons with suppressed viremia on stable antiretroviral therapy in a 3-month double-blind placebo-controlled trial (10 probiotic, 7 placebo). The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) was administered monthly. Blood was tested at the start and end of placebo/probiotic administration for viremia, CD4(+) T cell percentage/concentration, soluble (s)CD14, soluble intestinal fatty acid binding protein, sCD163, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. All participants maintained viremia <40 RNA copies/ml. The probiotic was safe and well tolerated, and appeared to improve chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Its administration was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of blood CD4(+) T cells compared to placebo (+2.8% versus -1.8%, p=0.018) although CD4(+) T cell concentrations were generally unchanged in both groups. None of the biomarkers showed significant changes on probiotic treatment or between-group differences in change (although significance was borderline for a greater sCD163 drop in the probiotic versus placebo group, p=0.05). Some biomarkers showed significant correlations to each other, particularly D-dimer with CRP and sCD14 with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. These data demonstrate the safety and possible benefit of this probiotic for residual inflammation in treated HIV-1 infection, although further study will be required to determine the immune pathways involved.",0
"The composition of human skin acts as a natural habitat for various bacterial species that function in a commensal and symbiotic fashion. In a healthy individual, bacterial flora serves to protect the host. Under certain conditions such as minor trauma, impaired host immunity, or environmental factors, the risk of developing skin infections is increased. Although a large majority of bacterial associated skin infections are common, a portion can potentially manifest into clinically significant morbidity. For example, Gram-positive species that typically reside on the skin such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus can cause numerous epidermal (impetigo, ecthyma) and dermal (cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, erysipelas) skin infections. Moreover, the increasing incidence of bacterial antibiotic resistance represents a serious challenge to modern medicine and threatens the health care system. Therefore, it is critical to develop tools and strategies that can allow us to better elucidate the nature and mechanism of bacterial virulence. To this end, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has been revolutionizing biomedical research, and has positively impacted the microbiology field. Advances in MS technologies have paved the way for numerous bacterial proteomes and their respective post translational modifications (PTMs) to be accurately identified and quantified in a high throughput and robust fashion. This technological platform offers critical information with regards to signal transduction, adherence, and microbial host interactions associated with bacterial pathogenesis. This mini-review serves to highlight the current progress proteomics has contributed toward the understanding of bacteria that are associated with skin related diseases, infections, and antibiotic resistance.",0
"Tick defensins may serve as templates for the development of multifunctional peptides. The purpose of this study was to evaluate shorter peptides derived from tick defensin isoform 2 (OsDef2) in terms of their antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities. We compared the structural and functional properties of a synthetic peptide derived from the carboxy-terminal of the parent peptide (Os) to that of an analogue in which the three cysteine residues were omitted (OsC). Here, we report that both peptides were bactericidal (MBC values ranging from 0.9415 mu g/ml) to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, whereas the parent peptide only exhibited Gram-positive antibacterial activity. The Os peptide was found to be two-fold more active than OsC against three of the four tested bacteria but equally active against Staphylococcus aureus. Os showed rapid killing kinetics against both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, whereas OsC took longer, suggesting different modes of action. Scanning electron microscopy showed that in contrast to melittin for which blebbing of bacterial surfaces was observed, cells exposed to either peptide appeared flattened and empty. Circular dichroism data indicated that in a membrane-mimicking environment, the cysteine-containing peptide has a higher -helical content. Both peptides were found to be non-toxic to mammalian cells. Moreover, the peptides displayed potent antioxidant activity and were 12 times more active than melittin. Multifunctional peptides hold potential for a wide range of clinical applications and further investigation into their mode of antibacterial and antioxidant properties is therefore warranted.

"In view of the role of DHFR in design and development of antimicrobials, we have attempted to develop a rigorously validated structure-based pharmacophore model comprising of two hydrogen bond donors, one hydrogen bond acceptor and two hydrophobic features. The model was used as a query to screen the National Cancer Institute and Maybridge database leading to retrieval of many hits which were screened on the basis of estimated activity, fit value and Lipinski's violation. Three most potent hits with zero lipinski's violation were subjected to docking studies which resulted into visualization of potential interaction capabilities of compounds in line to pharmacophoric features. All the three hits were subjected to in vitro antimicrobial evaluation, and the order of activity against various microbial strains was found to be HTS00987 > NSC47793 > NSC5475. Since HTS00987 appeared to be most active, it was subjected to permeability studies using in vitro everted intestinal sac permeation method. The results revealed that HTS00987 has good permeability proving its potential as druggable antimicrobial agent.",0
"We report here that stress experienced by bacteria due to aerosolization and air sampling can result in severe membrane impairment, leading to the release of DNA as free molecules. Escherichia coli and Bacillus atrophaeus bacteria were aerosolized and then either collected directly into liquid or collected using other collection media and then transferred into liquid. The amount of DNA released was quantified as the cell membrane damage index (I-D), i.e., the number of 16S rRNA gene copies in the supernatant liquid relative to the total number in the bioaerosol sample. During aerosolization by a Collison nebulizer, the I-D of E. coli and B. atrophaeus in the nebulizer suspension gradually increased during 60 min of continuous aerosolization. We found that the I-D of bacteria during aerosolization was statistically significantly affected by the material of the Collison jar (glass > polycarbonate; P < 0.001) and by the bacterial species (E. coli > B. atrophaeus; P < 0.001). When E. coli was collected for 5 min by filtration, impaction, and impingement, its I-D values were within the following ranges: 0.051 to 0.085, 0.16 to 0.37, and 0.068 to 0.23, respectively; when it was collected by electrostatic precipitation, the I-D values (0.011 to 0.034) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than those with other sampling methods. Air samples collected inside an equine facility for 2 h by filtration and impingement exhibited I-D values in the range of 0.30 to 0.54. The data indicate that the amount of cell damage during bioaerosol sampling and the resulting release of DNA can be substantial and that this should be taken into account when analyzing bioaerosol samples.",0
"A bioengineering, in particular to develop novel probiotic preparations based on Bacillus-strain bacteria, which can be used for preventing and treating infectious diseases and disbiosis of a human being, farm animals and birds. The novel strains of B. subtilis 07 (VKPM No. B-8611) and B. licheniformis 09 (VKPM No. B-8610) exhibit a broad spectrum of antagonistic activity, high proteolytic and amylase activity and a distinct ability in terms of a lysozim production. Such strains do not compete with each other but enter into synergistic relations in the form of an increased antagonistic action of the biopreparation. The inventive biopreparation comprises the B. subtilis 07 VKPM No. B-8611 and B. licheniformis 09 VKPM No. B-8610 strains and a protective medium. Such biopreparation can also contain a solvent and/or filler and exhibits an increased antagonistic activity with respect to a wide range of pathogenic and opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms and a resistance to quite a number of antibiotics.",0
"The present study was designed to investigate various extracts of Taxus baccata shoots for photochemical screening, antimicrobial activities and heavy metal analysis. Various extracts prepared from Taxus baccata shoots with n-hexane, dichlromethane, Iso-butanol, water and crude extract were tested for their antimicrobial potential. These extract were tested against ten microorganism including six gram-negative bacterial strains i.e. Escherichia coil, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmoneella typhi, Kleibsiella pneumoniae, Erwinia carotovora, Agrobacterium tumifaciens, three gram-positive bacterial strains viz Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atropheous and a fungal strain viz Candida albicans. Isobutanol extract showed marked antimicrobial potential against Bacillus atropheous. Phytochemical potential of extract was also evaluated by carrying out qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as ash value content. The qualitative tests revealed the presence of alkaloids, saponins, steroids, terpenoids and flavonoids. However tannins were not found. The quantitative tests detected alkaloids (0.2%) and saponins (4.2%). The ash value was found to be 2.68%. Heavy metal analysis was carried out to determine (Cd), (Mn), (Pb), (Cr), (Sb), (Na), (K), (Ca), (Cu) and (Fe). The metallic screening results showed the presence of Ca and K as major metallic content yielding 10021 and 8790.4 mg/kg respectively as compared to the rest of the nutrients, while Cd and Pb were not detected. The reported antimicrobial potential, phytochemicals screening and metal contents found in the samples of Taxus baccata shoots indicate that the plant has great pharmacological significance.",0
"In search of new and efficient antimicrobial and anticancer agents based on the imidazoquinoline structural framework, a series of novel 7-(1-isobutyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-yl)-7-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1, 3,5-trien-8-ones (8a-f) were synthesized from the corresponding 2,4-dihydroxoquinoline derivative through multistep reactions. The structures of these compounds were established by IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and mass spectral studies. The 7-(1-isobutyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-yl)-7-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1, 3,5-trien-8-one (8a-f) analogues were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity by serial dilution method minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The derivatives 8c, 8e and 8f exhibited excellent antibacterial activity comparable to the parent drug ampicillin with MIC value. Compounds 7a-f and 8a-f were also assessed for their cytotoxic activity (IC50) against HeLa cells using the Trypan blue exclusion assay method. The compounds 7c and 8b displayed potential anticancer activity. In a molecular docking study, these compounds showed minimum binding energy and good affinity towards the active pocket. They are believed to be good inhibitors of beta-tubulin. The results of these studies provided evidence that 7-(1-isobutyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-yl)-7-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1, 3,5-trien-8-one (8a-f) derivatives are a promising class of antibacterial and anticancer agents.",0
"A series of new 3-(2, 4-dichlorophenyl)-1-(2-(substituted phenoxy) acetyl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde were synthesized from substituted simple phenols. Substituted simple phenols were refluxed with ethylchloroacetate in presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate to yield substituted ethyl phenoxy acetate. Further substituted ethyl phenoxy acetate on treatment with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol yielded substituted 2-phenoxyacetohydrazide in turn on refluxing with 2,4-dichloro acetophenones yielded N′-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethylidene-2-(substituted phenoxy) acetohydrazides which on further treatment with DMF and POCl 3 undergo Vilsmer - Haack reaction to yield the title compounds i.e. 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-(2 (substituted phenoxy)acetyl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde (4a-j). The chemical structures of these compounds were confirmed by various physic-chemical methods viz, IR, 1H NMR mass spectral data and elemental analysis. Newly synthesized compounds were screened in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against varieties of gram +ve and gram -ve bacterial strains such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and fungi strains Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.

"Bacterial isolates from different cases of respiratory infections in small and large ruminants were evaluated bacterial culture and semi-nested PCR and identification was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Universal primers targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA for bacteria were used. Other sets of primers that were specific for Gram-positive bacteria and combinations of primers specific for Gram-negative organisms were used in the second PCR. The amplified PCR products were subjected to DNA sequence analysis. The DNA sequences of the isolated bacteria were aligned with the DNA sequences of bacteria in the GenBank through BLAST. Results confirmed isolation of three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative organisms. Gene sequence studies demonstrated identification of the Gram-positive microorganisms as Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus sporosarcinae and Bacillus pumilus while the identified Gram-negative organisms were Acinetobacter schindleri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from ruminants manifesting clinical signs of respiratory infection.",0
"Hard, nonporous environmental surfaces in daily life are now receiving due recognition for their role in reducing the spread of several nosocomial infections. In this work, we established the photokilling effects of 1% silver-doped titanium dioxide TiO2. The nanoparticles synthesized by liquid impregnation method were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Ag-TiO2 nanoparticle coatings that have been applied on glass and venetian blind surfaces were effective in generating a loss of viability of two bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis) after two hours of illumination under normal light in the visible spectrum. Such surfaces can be applicable to medical and other facilities where the potential for infection should be controlled.",0
"In the proceeding of screening new bioactive natural products, the ethyl acetate extract of the fermentation broth of Fusarium proliferatum ZS07, a fungus residing in the gut of long-horned grasshoppers (Tettigonia chinensis), was found possessing selective phytotoxic activity against the radicle growth of Amaranthus retroflexus L. Bioactivity-guided fractionation lead to the isolation of six fungal metabolites 1-6, including a new polyketide derivate O-methylated SMA93 (2) and five known compounds SMA93 (1), rhodolamprometrin (3), radicinin (4), dehydroallogibberic acid (5), and 3-methyl-6,8-dihydroxyisocoumarin (6). Their structures were identified on the basis of spectroscopic analysis and by comparison of the corresponding data to those reported in the literature previously. Phytotoxic effects of the four isolated compounds 1-4 on the radicle growth of A. retroflexus L. seeds were investigated under laboratory conditions, and compounds 2 and 4 showed good phytotoxic activity in the concentration of 100 mu g/mL, with the inhibition rates of 83.0 and 65.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the antibacterial activity of compounds 1-5 were evaluated against selected bacteria. Compounds 1-3 were found to possess potent antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 3.13-12.50 mu g/mL, while Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) and Salmonella typhimurium [CMCC(B) 50115] were not susceptible. These results suggest that the new polyketide derivate 2 and known compounds 1, 3, and 4 have potential to be used as biocontrol agents in agriculture.",0
"Effect of dietary supplementation of a Gram-positive, aerobic, probiotic bacterium Bacillus subtilis on the immunohaematological indices during pre- and post-challenge in Indian major carp, catla (Catla catla), was studied. The B. subtilis was administered orally at four different doses 1.0 x 10(6) (T-1), 1.0 x 10(7) (T-2), 1.0 x 10(8) (T-3), and 1.0 x 10(9) (T-4) cfu g(-1) feed to C. catla for 90 days. The positive control (C-p) and negative control (C-n) were fed with feed without B. subtilis for the same period. On the 60th day, blood and serum were sampled to determine various haematological and serum parameters. Fish were challenged intraperitoneally with Aeromonas hydrophila after 60 days in all the treatment groups and C-p, while the C-n was challenged with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) only. Dietary supplementation of B. subtilis leads to the rise of various immunological and haematological parameters in catla during the pre- and post-challenge. During pre-challenge, the highest TEC (1.30 +/- A 0.02 x 10(6) cells mm(-3)), haemoglobin (7.43 +/- A 0.25 g %), total serum protein (3.89 +/- A 0.08 g dL(-1)), and serum lysozyme activity (8.39 +/- A 0.01 A mu g ml(-1)) were recorded in fishes fed feed containing B. subtilis at 1 x 10(9) cfu/g feed (T-4). The highest survival percentage (86.33 %) was also observed in T-4 group. The significantly increased survival percentage (P < 0.05) of B. subtilis-treated groups in comparison with control group (C-p) suggests that dietary supplementation of this probiotic bacterium can protect catla from A. hydrophila infection by enhancing innate immunity.",1
The retention behavior of biologically active pyrazoles has been determined using RP-18 TLC and IAM chromatography. The experimental parameters of lipophilicity of the studied compounds were determined and compared with calculated partition coefficients obtained by using of different algorithms.

"Introduction. Mexico is one of the most important producers and exporters of blackberries in the world. During postharvest handling, blackberry fruits are exposed to the attack of phytopathogenic fungi. Materials and methods. To obtain Rhizopus stolonifer isolates, samples of leaves and rhizospheric soils were placed on Petri plates containing Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA). In addition, fruits were also placed in humidity chambers at 25 C. To describe the infection process on blackberry fruits by Rhizopus stolonifer, samples were taken at different intervals for a period of 72 h. All fungal isolates obtained were maintained on PDA. The bacterial colonies were isolated and purified by streaking on PDA. The antagonistic activity of the bacteria was assessed against R. stolonifer by dual culture technique on PDA. To detect the production of siderophores, the chrome azurol S assay was carried out. Results. The infection process of R. stolonifer on blackberry fruits was described for the first time in this work. Eighty-six bacterial isolates from different parts of the plant and rhizospheric soil were obtained. Bacterial isolates with antagonistic activity were identified and the production of siderophores was measured. Four isolates showed antagonistic activity against R. stolonifer. Bacillus subtilis obtained from soil was the most effective isolate. Conclusion. In this study we isolated and identified antagonistic bacteria with potential for biocontrol on Rhizopus stolonifer obtained from blackberry fruits. To our knowledge this is the first report regarding this topic.",0
"The emergence of serious issues of multidrug resistance in the past few years forced the consideration of bacteriocins for combating infections. Numerous concerns have been raised against increased bacterial resistance toward effective drugs and become a debated issue all over the world. Alongside, there is an increase in consumer demand for the antimicrobial compounds isolated or derived from natural sources. Production of antimicrobial compounds is considered as a ubiquitous anti-competitor strategy in microbial ecosystem. Research on antimicrobial compounds with a special interest on bacteriocins is opening a door of a new age. Bacteriocins play an immense role in different industries to overcome various unrestrained environmental issues. Many researchers are now focusing on the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with plenty of applications not only in food industries but also in medical and health applications. Their infrequent and targeted use leads to the reduction in the emergence of drug resistance by microbes. Currently, bacteriocins produced by LAB are extensively studied due to their generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status. Various species of LAB are reported to have therapeutic properties that confer beneficial effects on human and animal health. The public health dilemma of drug resistance can be resolved by the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds having target-specific inhibition especially against multidrug-resistant organisms. Consequently, the pool of effective drugs could be available all the time to control newly emerging drug resistance in bacteria.",0
"Secretory phospholipasesA(2) (sPLA(2)s) form a large family of structurally related enzymes widespread in nature. Herein, we studied the inhibitory effects of sPLA(2)s from Vipera lebetina (VLPLA(2)), Vipera berus berus (VBBPLA(2)), and Naja naja oxiana (NNOPLA(2)) venoms on (i) human platelets, (ii) four different bacterial strains (gram-negative Escherichia coli and Vibrio fischeri; gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) and (iii) five types of cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, MCF-7, K-562 and B16-F10) in vitro. sPLA(2)s inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation: VBBPLA(2) IC50 = 0.054, VLPLA(2) IC50 = 0.072, NNOPLA(2) IC50 = 0.814 mu M. p-Bromophenacylbromide-inhibited sPLA(2) had no inhibitory action on platelets. 36.17 mu M VBBPLA(2) completely inhibited the growth of gram-positive Bacillus subtilis whereas no growth inhibition was observed towards gram-negative Escherichia coli. The inhibitory action of sPLA(2)s (similar to 0.7 mu M and similar to 7 mu M) towards cancer cells depended on both venom and cell type. VBBPLA(2) (7.2 mu M) inhibited significantly the viability of K-562 cells and the cell death appeared apoptotic. The sPLA(2)s exhibited no inhibitory effect towards LNCaP cells and some effect (8%-20%) towards other cells. Thus, already sub-mu M concentrations of sPLA(2)s inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation and from the current suite of studied svPLA(2)s and test cells, VBBPLA(2) was the most growth inhibitory towards Bacillus subtilis and K-562 cells.",0
"Main objective of this work was to examine the antimicrobial activity against the selected food borne pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility of selected microflora isolated from idli batter. Ten representative isolates tested shown the inhibition against all the tested food pathogens, such as, Escherichia coli (6-16mm), Salmonella typhi (10-17mm), Staphylcoccus aureus (6-22mm), Serratia marcescens (6mm), Listeria monocytogens (6-21mm), Bacillus cereus (6mm), Shigella flexnari (6mm and 10mm). The isolates also revealed resistance towards antibiotics such as vancomycin, erythromycin, ciproflaxin and tetracyclin. This work documents the functional characteristics of these selected cultures intended for potential probiotic use.",0
"Combinations of glycopeptides and beta-lactams exert synergistic antibacterial activity, but the evolutionary mechanisms driving resistance to both antibiotics remain largely unexplored. By repeated subculturing with increasing vancomycin (VAN) and cefuroxime (CEF) concentrations, we isolated an evolved strain of the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis with reduced susceptibility to both antibiotics. Whole-genome sequencing revealed point mutations in genes encoding the major sigma factor of RNA polymerase (sigA), a cell shape-determining protein (mreB), and the rho termination factor (rho). Genetic-reconstruction experiments demonstrated that the G-to-C substitution at position 336 encoded by sigA (sigA(G336C)), in the domain that recognizes the -35 promoter region, is sufficient to reduce susceptibility to VAN and works cooperatively with the rho(G56C) substitution to increase CEF resistance. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the sigA(G336C) substitution has wide-ranging effects, including elevated expression of the general stress sigma factor (sigma(B)) regulon, which is required for CEF resistance, and decreased expression of the glpTQ genes, which leads to fosfomycin (FOS) resistance. Our findings suggest that mutations in the core transcriptional machinery may facilitate the evolution of resistance to multiple cell wall antibiotics.",0
"In nature, essential oils play an important role in the protection of the plants by exerting antibacterial, -viral, -fungal, -oxidative, -genotoxic, and free radical scavenging properties, as well as in some cases acting as insecticides. Several Satureja species are used in traditional medicine due to recognized therapeutic properties, namely anti-microbial and cytotoxic activities. The purpose of the present work was to determine the biologic activity of the essential oil of S. khuzistanica Jamzad (Lamiaceae) against four human cancer cell lines, as well as its inhibitory effects against a wide array (i.e. n - 11) of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The essential oil was isolated by hydro-distillation and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Carvacrol (92.87%) and limonene (1.2%) were found to be the main components of the isolated oil. Anti-microbial activity of the essential oil was assessed using a disc diffusion method; an MTT cytotoxicity assay was employed to test effects of the oil on each cancer cell line. The oil exhibited considerable anti-microbial activity against the majority of the tested bacteria and fungi. The test oil also significantly reduced cell viability of Vero, SW480, MCF7, and JET 3 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with the IC50 values calculated for each cell type being, respectively, 31.2, 62.5, 125, and 125 mg/ml. Based on the findings, it is concluded that the essential oil of S. khuzistanica and its major constituents have a potential for further use in anti-bacterial and anti-cancer applications, pending far more extensive testing of toxicities in normal (i.e. primary) cells.",0
"Bacillus cereus is an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for food poisoning and other, nongastrointestinal infections. Due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant B. cereus strains, the demand for alternative therapeutic options is increasing. To address these problems, we isolated and characterized a Siphoviridae virulent phage, PBC1, and its lytic enzymes. PBC1 showed a very narrow host range, infecting only 1 of 22 B. cereus strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the major capsid protein revealed that PBC1 is more closely related to the Bacillus clarkii phage BCJA1c and phages of lactic acid bacteria than to the phages infecting B. cereus. Whole-genome comparison showed that the late-gene region, including the terminase gene, structural genes, and holin gene of PBC1, is similar to that from B. cereus temperate phage 250, whereas their endolysins are different. Compared to the extreme host specificity of PBC1, its endolysin, LysPBC1, showed a much broader lytic spectrum, albeit limited to the genus Bacillus. The catalytic domain of LysPBC1 when expressed alone also showed Bacillus-specific lytic activity, which was lower against the B. cereus group but higher against the Bacillus subtilis group than the full-length protein. Taken together, these results suggest that the virulent phage PBC1 is a useful component of a phage cocktail to control B. cereus, even with its exceptionally narrow host range, as it can kill a strain of B. cereus that is not killed by other phages, and that LysPBC1 is an alternative biocontrol agent against B. cereus.",0
"We investigated whether Bacillus spp., newly isolated from Korean traditional food resources, influence the resistance of hosts to foodborne pathogens, by using Caenorhabditis elegans as a surrogate host model. Initially, we selected 20 Bacillus spp. that possess antimicrobial activity against various foodborne pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus. Among the selected strains, six strains of Bacillus spp. used in preconditioning significantly prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to S. aureus. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, all six strains were identified as B. licheniformis. Our findings suggest that preconditioning with B. licheniformis may modulate the host defense response against S. aureus.",0
"AimsTo purify and characterize the biosurfactants produced by Achromobacter sp. HZ01. Methods and ResultsAfter fermentation, one biosurfactant was successfully purified from the fermentation broth of strain HZ01 by centrifugation, extraction using ethyl acetate, silica gel chromatography and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the biosurfactant and the effects of temperatures, pH and salinities on its stability were determined. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, analysis of fatty acids and amino acids and mass spectrometry were used to characterize the biosurfactant. The maximum production yield of the crude biosurfactant reached to 684gl(-1) after incubation for 96h. Except the favourable adaptability to a wide range of temperatures, pH and salinities, the biosurfactant with a CMC value of 48mgl(-1) could efficiently emulsify diverse hydrophobic compounds. The chemical formula of this biosurfactant was confirmed to be CH3-(CH2)(17)-CHO-CH2-CO-Gly-Gly-Leu-Met-Leu-Leu, in which the oxygen atom of group CHO linked to the last amino acid (Leu), a structure had never been reported before. ConclusionsThe purified biosurfactant is a novel cyclic lipopeptide. Significance and Impact of the StudyOne novel lipopeptide was purified and characterized. The novel biosurfactant exhibited good potential applications, such as bioremediation.",0
"The essential oil obtained from the fresh leaves of Zanthoxylum alatum was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Fourteen components were identified, and linalool (30.58%), 2-decanone (20.85%), beta-fenchol (9.43%), 2-tridecanone (8.86%), beta-phellandrene (5.99%), Sabinene (4.82%), and alpha-pinene (4.11%) were the main components. The EO and methanolic extract of Z. alatumexhibited potent antifungal activity againstAlternaria alternata, Alternaria brassicae, andCurvularia lunata. The EO also showed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Further, antimicrobial constituents of the EO were isolated by bioautography and preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) and identified as beta-fenchol and linalool using GC/MS analysis. In addition to this, the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant potential of EO andmethanolic extract/fractions of Z. alatum were also investigated using in vitro assays including scavenging ability against DPPH center dot, reducing power and chelating ability on Fe2+ ions. Our results demonstrate that Z. alatum could be used as a resource of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds which may find applications in food and pesticide industries.",0
"The increasing rate of resistance of pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, to classical antibiotics has driven research toward identification of other means to fight infectious disease. One particularly viable option is the use of bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolases, called endolysins or enzybiotics. These enzymes lyse the bacterial cell wall upon direct contact, are not inhibited by traditional antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and have already shown great promise in the areas of food safety, human health, and veterinary science. We have identified and characterized an endolysin, PlyGRCS, which displays dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and biofilm S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The spectrum of lytic activity for this enzyme includes all S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested, but not other Gram-positive pathogens. The contributions of the PlyGRCS putative catalytic and cell wall binding domains were investigated through deletion analysis. The cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain displayed activity by itself, though reduced, indicating the necessity of the binding domain for full activity. In contrast, the SH3_5 binding domain lacked activity but was shown to interact directly with the staphylococcal cell wall via fluorescent microscopy. Site-directed mutagenesis studies determined that the active site residues in the CHAP catalytic domain were C29 and H92, and its catalytic functionality required calcium as a co-factor. Finally, biochemical assays coupled with mass spectrometry analysis determined that PlyGRCS displays both N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase and d-alanyl-glycyl endopeptidase hydrolytic activities despite possessing only a single catalytic domain. These results indicate that PlyGRCS has the potential to become a revolutionary therapeutic option to combat bacterial infections.",0
"PutP and OpuE serve as proline transporters when this imino acid is used by Bacillus subtilis as a nutrient or as an osmostress protectant, respectively. The simultaneous inactivation of the PutP and OpuE systems still allows the utilization of proline as a nutrient. This growth phenotype pointed to the presence of a third proline transport system in B. subtilis. We took advantage of the sensitivity of a putP opuE double mutant to the toxic proline analog 3,4-dehydro-DL-proline (DHP) to identify this additional proline uptake system. DHP-resistant mutants were selected and found to be defective in the use of proline as a nutrient. Whole-genome resequencing of one of these strains provided the lead that the inactivation of the gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) transporter GabP was responsible for these phenotypes. DNA sequencing of the gabP gene in 14 additionally analyzed DHP-resistant strains confirmed this finding. Consistently, each of the DHP-resistant mutants was defective not only in the use of proline as a nutrient but also in the use of GABA as a nitrogen source. The same phenotype resulted from the targeted deletion of the gabP gene in a putP opuE mutant strain. Hence, the GabP carrier not only serves as an uptake system for GABA but also functions as the third proline transporter of B. subtilis. Uptake studies with radiolabeled GABA and proline confirmed this conclusion and provided information on the kinetic parameters of the GabP carrier for both of these substrates.",0
"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is recognized as the leading cause of human gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of seafood. NT-6 antimicrobial peptide (AMPNT-6) that is a novel antimicrobial peptide secreted by Bacillus subtilis NT-6 isolated from Natto which is a Chinese traditional fermented food can be an effective method to reduce V. parahaemolyticus. This study aimed at investigating the factors that affected the application of AMPNT-6, such as temperature, salinity, pH value and sodium pyrosulfite concentration by response surface method and modeled the effect of AMPNT-6 on inhibition to V. parahaemolyticus in shrimp under various environmental conditions. Design-Expert software was chosen to perform regression fit and to establish the antibiotic mathematical model. The results indicated that all the above environmental conditions had no significant interactive effects on the antibacterial activity of AMPNT-6. The quadratic polynomial mathematical model was established and obtained the quadratic regression equation of the predictive value Y (bacterial colony number) and variables x(1) (temperature), x(2) (sodium chloride concentration), x(3) (pH), x(4) (sodium pyrosulfite concentration) and x(5) (AMPNT-6 concentration) in a certain range: Y = 6.60 + 0.34x(1) - 0.23x(3) - 0.19x(5) - 0.29x(1)(2) + 0.19x(2)(2) + 03x(4)(2) - 035x(1)x(2) (R-2 = 0.8963). The experimental values were shown to be in good agreement with predicted values. The established model had a high fitting degree and could predict the inhibition effect of AMPNT-6 toward V. parahaemolyticus growth in shrimp under various conditions.

"Beneficial interactions between microorganisms and plants, particularly in the rhizosphere, are a research area of global interest. Four cadmium (Cd)-tolerant bacterial strains were isolated from heavy metal-contaminated sludge and their effects on Cd mobility in soil and the root elongation and Cd accumulation of Orychophragmus violaceus were explored to identify the capability of metal-resistant rhizobacteria for promoting the growth of O. violaceus roots on Cd-contaminated soils. The isolated strains, namely, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, significantly enhanced the plant Cd accumulation. The Cd concentrations in the roots and shoots were increased by up to 2.29- and 2.86-fold, respectively, by inoculation of B. megaterium, as compared with the uninoculated control. The bacterial strains displayed different effects on the shoot biomass. Compared with the uninoculated plants, the shoot biomass of the inoculated plants was slightly increased by B. megaterium and significantly decreased by the other strains. B. megaterium was identified as the best candidate for enhancing Cd accumulation in O. violaceus. Thus, this study provides novel insight into the development of plant-microbe systems for phytoremediation.",0
"A microcosm experiment was setup to examine (1) the effect of phenanthrene contamination on meiofauna and bacteria communities and (2) the effects of different bioremediation strategies on phenanthrene degradation and on the community structure of free-living marine nematodes. Sediments from Bizerte lagoon were contaminated with (100 mg kg(-1)) phenanthrene and effects were examined after 20 days. Biostimulation (addition of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer or mineral salt medium) and bioaugmentation (inoculation of a hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium) were used as bioremediation treatments. Bacterial biomass was estimated using flow cytometry. Meiofauna was counted and identified at the higher taxon level using a stereomicroscope. Nematodes, comprising approximately two thirds of total meiofauna abundance, were identified to genus or species. Phenanthrene contamination had a severe impact on bacteria and meiofauna abundances with a strong decrease of nematodes with a complete disappearance of polychaetes and copepods. Bioremediation counter balanced the toxic effects of phenanthrene since meiofauna and bacteria abundances were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than those observed in phenanthrene contamination. Up to 98 % of phenanthrene removal was observed. In response to phenanthrene contamination, the nematode species had different behavior: Daptonema fallax was eliminated in contaminated microcosms, suggesting that it is an intolerant species to phenanthrene; Neochromadora peocilosoma, Spirinia parasitifera, and Odontophora n. sp., which significantly (p < 0.05) increased in contaminated microcosms, could be considered as ""opportunistic"" species to phenanthrene whereas Anticoma acuminata and Calomicrolaimus honestus increased in the treatment combining biostimulation and bioaugmentation. Phenanthrene had a significant effect on meiofaunal and bacterial abundances (p < 0.05), with a strong reduction of density and change in the nematode communities. Biostimulation using mineral salt medium strongly enhanced phenanthrene removal, leading to a decrease of its toxicity. This finding opens exciting axes for the future use of biostimulation to reduce toxic effects of PAHs for meiofauna and bacteria in lagoon sediment.",0
"Two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), consisting of a sensor histidine protein kinase and its cognate response regulator, are an important mode of environmental sensing in bacteria. Additionally, they have been found to regulate virulence determinants in several pathogens. Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax and a bioterrorism agent, harbours 41 pairs of TCS. However, their role in its pathogenicity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that WalRK of B. anthracis forms a functional TCS which exhibits some species-specific functions. Biochemical studies showed that domain variants of WalK, the histidine kinase, exhibit classical properties of autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to its cognate response regulator WalR. Interestingly, these domain variants also show phosphatase activity towards phosphorylated WalR, thereby making WalK a bifunctional histidine kinase/phosphatase. An in silico regulon determination approach, using a consensus binding sequence from Bacillus subtilis, provided a list of 30 genes that could form a putative WalR regulon in B. anthracis. Further, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to show direct binding of purified WalR to the upstream regions of three putative regulon candidates, an S-layer protein EA1, a cell division ABC transporter FtsE and a sporulation histidine kinase KinB3. Our work lends insight into the species-specific functions and mode of action of B. anthracis WalRK. (C) 2013 The Authors.

"Nine new meroterpenes (1-9) and one new dioxolanone derivative (10), along with seven known compounds (11-17), were isolated from solid cultures of the endophytic fungus Guignardia sp., obtained from Euphorbia sieboldiana. Their structures were elucidated by analysis of UV, IR, 1D and 2D NMR, and HRESIMS data, and their absolute configurations were determined by a combination of single-crystal X-ray studies, modified Mosher methods, and Rh-2(OCOCF3)(4)(-) and Mo-2(OCOCH3)(4)-induced electronic circular dichroism experiments. All compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects alone and with fluconazole on the growth and biofilms of Candida albicans. At 6.3 mu g/mL combined with 0.031 mu g/mL of fluconazole, compounds 8 and 16 were found to have prominent inhibition on the growth of C. albicans with fractional inhibitory concentration index values of 0.23 and 0.19, respectively. Combined with fluconazole, both of them (40 mu g/mL for 8 and 20 mu g/mL for 16) could also inhibit C. albicans biofilms and reverse the tolerance of C. albicans biofilms to fluconazole.",0
"Extracellular low-molecular weight guanyl-preferring ribonucleases (LMW RNases) of Bacillus sp. comprise a group of hydrolytic enzymes that share highly similar structural and catalytic characteristics with barnase, a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and binase, a ribonuclease from Bacillus intermedius. Although the physical-chemical and catalytic properties of Bacillus guanyl-preferring ribonucleases are very similar, there is considerably more variation in the environmental conditions that lead to the induction of the genes encoding these RNases. Based on structural differences of their genes the guanyl-preferring ribonucleases have been sub-divided into binase-like and barnase-like groups. Here we show the ability of the key regulator of phosphate deficiency response, PhoP, to direct the transcription of the binase-like RNases but not barnase-like RNases. These results, together with our demonstration that binase-like RNases are induced in response to phosphate starvation, allow us to categorise this group of ribonucleases as new members of Bacillus PhoP regulon. In contrast, the barnase-like ribonucleases are relatively insensitive to the phosphate concentration and the environmental conditions that are responsible for their induction, and the regulatory elements involved, are currently unknown.

"The effects of Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus awamori and Pseudomonas fluorescens on the wilt-leaf spot disease complex of tomato caused by Meloidogyne javanica, Ralstonia solanacearum and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria were observed. Inoculation of B. subtilis, A. awamori and P. fluorescens caused a significant increase in plant growth and chlorophyll contents of pathogen-inoculated plants. Inoculation of P. fluorescens caused a greater increase in plant growth and chlorophyll contents of pathogen-inoculated plants than that caused by A. awamori. Application of P. fluorescens with B. subtilis caused a greater increase in plant growth and chlorophyll contents of pathogen-inoculated plants, but the maximum increase was observed when all the three biocontrol agents were inoculated together. P. fluorescens colonized tomato roots more than colonization by B. subtilis. Root colonization by P. fluorescens and B. subtilis was reduced when pathogens were inoculated with rhizobacteria. Inoculation of P. fluorescens caused a greater reduction in galling and nematode reproduction, followed by B. subtilis and A. awamori. Maximum reduction in galling, nematode reproduction, wilt and leaf spot disease indices was observed when all three biocontrol agents were used together.",0
"The development of semiconductor materials made a considerable progress of catalytic technologies. In the present study, a simple and eco-friendly chemical direction for the synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using leaf extract of Moringa oleifera has been used. The prepared ZnO NPs were characterized various techniques such as UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). XRD analysis revealed the wurtzite hexagonal structure of ZnO NPs. FT-IR confirmed the presence of functional groups of both leaf extract and ZnO NPs. The particles size, morphology and topography determined from FE-SEM. The intense and narrow width of zinc and oxygen have high purity and crystalline were identified using EDX. UV-Vis absorption showed the characteristic absorption peak of ZnO NPs. The results of antimicrobial activities revealed that maximum zones of inhibition was observed Gram (+ve) positive bacteria and followed by the Gram ( ye) negative bacteria and fungal at concentration of 200 mu g/mL of ZnO NPs.

"Huanglongbing (HLB) is the most serious disease affecting the citrus industry worldwide to date. The causal agent, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), resides in citrus phloem, which makes it difficult to effectively treat with chemical compounds. In this study, a transcuticular nanoemulsion formulation was developed to enhance the permeation of an effective antimicrobial compound (ampicillin; Amp) against HLB disease through the citrus cuticle into the phloem via a foliar spray. The results demonstrated that efficiency of cuticle isolation using an enzymatic method (pectinase and cellulase) was dependent on the citrus cultivar and Las-infection, and it was more difficult to isolate cuticles from valencia orange (Citrus sinensis) and HLB-symptomatic leaves. Of eight adjuvants tested, Brij 35 provided the greatest increase in permeability of the HLB-affected cuticle with a 3.33-fold enhancement of cuticular permeability over water control. An in vitro assay using Bacillus subtilis showed that nanoemulsion formulations containing Amp (droplets size = 5.26 +/- 0.04 nm and 94 +/- 1.48 nm) coupled with Brij 35 resulted in greater inhibitory zone diameters (5.75 mm and 6.66 mm) compared to those of Brij 35 (4.34 mm) and Amp solution (2.83 mm) alone. Furthermore, the nanoemulsion formulations eliminated Las bacteria in HLB-affected citrus in planta more efficiently than controls. Our study shows that a water in oil (W/O) nanoemulsion formulation may provide a useful model for the effective delivery of chemical compounds into citrus phloem via a foliar spray for controlling citrus HLB.",0
"The lipopeptide antibiotic fengycin, produced by Bacillus subtilis, strongly inhibits growth of filamentous fungi. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fengycin treatment on apoptosis and necrosis in Rhizopus stolonifer by means of cell staining and epifluorescence microscopy. At fengycin concentrations less than 50 mu g/ml, treated fungal cells demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis-associated markers compared with the untreated control. These markers included chromatin condensation, reactive oxygen species accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, phosphatidylserine externalization, and the occurrence of DNA strand breaks. These results showed that fungal cells were impaired in a number of important functions and entered apoptosis upon treatment with low concentrations of fengycin. In contrast, high concentrations (>50 mu g/ml) induced necrosis, indicating that the fungicidal action of fengycin operates via two modes: apoptosis at low concentrations and necrosis at high concentrations. Additionally, the apoptotic effect that we have shown suggests that lower concentrations of fengycin than previously thought may be effective for food preservation.",0
"Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are recognized as significant opportunistic pathogens. However, current knowledge of virulence mechanisms is very limited because a significant proportion of CoNS are refractory to available techniques for DNA transformation. We describe an efficient protocol for plasmid transfer using bacteriophage Phi 187, which can transduce plasmid DNA to a wide range of CoNS from a unique, engineered Staphylococcus aureus strain. The use of a restriction-deficient, modification-proficient S. aureus PS187 mutant, which has a CoNS-type bacteriophage surface receptor, allows plasmid transfer to CoNS even when they are refractory to electroporation. Once the Phi 187 titer reaches 10(9) plaque-forming units per milliliter, plasmid transfer can be accomplished within 1-2 d. Thus, our protocol is a major technical advance offering attractive opportunities for research on CoNS-mediated infections.",0
"Two new stemphol sulfates, stemphol A (1) and stemphol B (2), along with known compound stemphol (3) were isolated from the EtOAc extract of the fermentation of an endophytic Stemphylium sp. 33231.

The isolated compounds exhibited potent antibacterial activities against six terrestrial pathogenic bacteria with MIC values of 0.6-10 mu g ml(-1). The inhibitory activities of all compounds against five cancer cell lines were evaluated.",0
"A MarR-like transcriptional repressor (RcrR) and two predicted ABC efflux pumps (RcrPQ) encoded by a single operon were recently shown to be dominant regulators of stress tolerance and development of genetic competence in the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans. Here, we focused on polar (Delta rcrR-P) and nonpolar (Delta rcrR-NP) rcrR mutants, which are hyper- and nontransformable, respectively, to dissect the mechanisms by which these mutations impact competence. We discovered two open reading frames (ORFs) in the 3' end of the rcrQ gene that encode peptides of 27 and 42 amino acids (aa) which are also dramatically upregulated in the Delta rcrR-NP strain. Deletion of, or start codon mutations in, the ORFs for the peptides in the Delta rcrR-NP background restored competence and sensitivity to competence- stimulating peptide (CSP) to levels seen in the Delta rcrR-P strain. Overexpression of the peptides adversely affected competence development. Importantly, overexpression of mutant derivatives of the ABC exporters that lacked the peptides also resulted in impaired competence. FLAG-tagged versions of the peptides could be detected in S. mutans, and FLAG tagging of the peptides impaired their function. The competence phenotypes associated with the various mutations, and with overexpression of the peptides and ABC transporters, were correlated with the levels of ComX protein in cells. Collectively, these studies revealed multiple novel mechanisms for regulation of competence development by the components of the rcrRPQ operon. Given their intimate role in competence and stress tolerance, the rcrRPQ-encoded peptides may prove to be useful targets for therapeutics to diminish the virulence of S. mutans.",0
"Vegetable crops are frequently infected by fungal pathogens, which can include seedborne fungi. In such cases, the pathogen is already present within or on the seed surface, and can thus cause seed rot and seedling damping-off. Treatment of vegetable seeds has been shown to prevent plant disease epidemics caused by seedborne fungal pathogens. Furthermore, seed treatments can be useful in reducing the amounts of pesticides required to manage a disease, because effective seed treatments can eliminate the need for foliar application of fungicides later in the season. Although the application of fungicides is almost always effective, their non-target environmental impact and the development of pathogen resistance have led to the search for alternative methods, especially in the past few years. Physical treatments that have already been used in the past and treatments with biopesticides, such as plant extracts, natural compounds and biocontrol agents, have proved to be effective in controlling seedborne pathogens. These have been applied alone or in combination, and they are widely used owing to their broad spectrum in terms of disease control and production yield. In this review, the effectiveness of different seed treatments against the main seedborne pathogens of some important vegetable crops is critically discussed. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry",0
"Although biorefinery has become a common concept to convert biomass into biofuels and value-added chemicals for better cost-performance, good microbial hosts that can be used to implement the concept are still wanting. In this study, a Kluyveromyces marxianus yeast, named KY3, was isolated from a Taiwanese kefir microbial consortium. We showed that KY3 could grow on a broad spectrum of substrates, including hexose and pentose sugars. It is heat and toxin tolerant, can grow under a wide range of pH values (pH 2.5-9), and shows a high ethanol production rate at elevated temperatures. It also can produce value-added aromatic chemicals, such as 2-phenylethylethanol and 2-phenylethyl acetate, during the fermentative process. A genetic transformation was achieved in KY3 to express a rumen fungal beta-glucosidase gene, and the transgenic host (KY3-NpaBGS) could efficiently convert cellobiose to ethanol. Furthermore, it was shown that a novel dual-microbe co-culture system of Bacillus subtilis and KY3-NpaBGS can be employed for bioethanol production from cellulosic material. Thus, KY3 has a high potential to be a good host for biorefinery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Pathogenic organisms, causes of various infectious diseases, possess a rich repository of antigenic proteins that engender an immune response in a host. These types of diseases are usually treated with the use of pharmaceuticals; unfortunately, many of these also have a potential to induce fatal side effects, especially allergic responses in the diseased host. In addition, many pathogens evolve (by selective survival) single or multi-drug resistance (MDR). Therefore, a means to prevent the host from becoming susceptible to the pathogen from the onset, rather than trying to devise pharmacologic protocols to treat an ongoing infection, are increasingly seen as desirable to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases altogether. To this end, cost-effective development and use of ""safe"" vaccines is key. This paper provides an overview on the new and expanding area of computational vaccinology and a brief background on pathogen antigenicity, identification of pathogen-specific antigens, and screening of candidate antigens using various tools and databases developed in the recent past.",0
"The present study was carried out to develop a new natural product reagent which has antimicrobial and antiviral effect, so we assayed the extract from Korean Arbor vitae ( Thuja koraiensis) on antimicrobial and antiviral in vitro. The antimicrobial activity was assayed at two gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis); two gram-negative bacteria ( Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium) and the results were measured by the paper disc diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The antiviral activity of T. koraiensis extract was assayed at the Bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus which is a RNA virus replication in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells and the results were measured by maximum non cytotoxic concentration (MNCC) and maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD). The result of paper disk diffusion assay showed that extract had the high antimicrobial effect at S. aureus strain. The MNCC of extract on MDBK cells was 0.031% and the MNTD of extract was 0.0195% on BVD virus. These results suggested that T. koraiensis extract had antimicrobial and antiviral effect, especially at low concentrations which had a strong antiviral effect at BVD virus. The T. koraiensis extract could also be useful as disinfectant for bacterial. The study of T. koraiensis function perhaps would be the first and more research is needed in the future.",0
"Bacillus subtilis SPB1 lipopeptides were evaluated as a natural antifungal agent against Fusarium solani infestation. In vitro antifungal assay showed a minimal inhibitory concentration of about 3 mg/ml with a fungicidal mode of action. In fact, treatment of F. solani by SPB1 lipopeptides generated excessive lyses of the mycelium and caused polynucleation and destruction of the related spores together with a total inhibition of spore production. Furthermore, an inhibition of germination potency accompanied with a high spore blowing was observed. Moreover, in order to be applied in agricultural field, in vivo antifungal activity was proved against the dry rot potato tubers caused by F. solani. Preventive treatment appeared as the most promising as after 20 days of fungi inoculation, rot invasion was reduced by almost 78 %, in comparison to that of non-treated one. When treating infected tomato plants, disease symptoms were reduced by almost 100 % when applying the curative method. Results of this study are very promising as it enables the use of the crude lipopeptide preparation of B. subtilis SPB1 as a potent natural fungicide that could effectively control the infection of F. solani in tomato and potato tubers at a concentration similar to the commercial fungicide hymexazol and therefore prevent the damage of olive tree.",1
"Infections caused by microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, etc. are the main obstacle in healing processes. Conventional antibacterial administration routes can be listed as oral, intravenous/intramuscular, topical and inhalation. These kinds of drug administrations are faced with critical vital issues such as; more rapid delivery of the drug than intended which can result in bacterial resistance, dose related systemic toxicity, tissue irritation and finally delayed healing process that need to be tackled. Recently, studies have been focused on new drug delivery systems, overcoming resistance and toxicological problems and finally localizing the molecules at the site of action in a proper dose. In this regard, many nanotechnological approaches such as nanoparticulate therapeutic systems have been developed to address accompanying problems mentioned above. Among them, drug loaded electrospun nanofibers propose main advantages like controlled drug delivery, high drug loading capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, simultaneous delivery of multiple drugs, ease of production and cost effectiveness for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Therefore, some particular attention has been devoted to the design of electrospun nanofibers as promising antibacterial drug carrier systems. A variety of antibacterials e.g., biocides, antibiotics, quaternary ammonium salts, triclosan, metallic nanoparticles (silver, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide) and antibacterial polymers (chitosan, polyethyleneimine, etc.) have been impregnated by various techniques into nanofibers that exhibit strong antibacterial activity in standard assays. This review highlights the design and delivery of antibacterial drug loaded nanofibers with particular focus on their function in the fields of drug delivery, wound healing, tissue engineering, cosmetics and other biomedical applications.",0
"Powdery mildew caused by Erysiphepisi Syd. is one of the major threats to garden pea production worldwide. It causes significant yield losses and reduces the pod quality. To minimize the fungicide inputs yet sustain the productivity of the crop, the potential of Bacillus subtilis isolated from infected garden pea leaves was further evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions. Egg yolk+canola oil (EYCO) at the rate of 1 egg yolk + 60 ml canola oil/60 liters water was the most effective as reflected by the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). Although significantly lower in efficacy than EYCO, B. subtilis (PM 2011-001) at the rate of 10 6 CFU/ml, Silicon (3.2 g/16 L water), Virtuoso (the commercial preparation of B. subtilis) applied at 720 ml/16 L water and Verticillium sp. (10 6 spores/ml) significantly suppressed powdery mildew infection comparable to the standard chemical, Sulfur following the recommended rate (53 g/16 L water). On the other hand, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) at the rate of 80 g/16 L water and B. subtilis (PCN-2011-003) applied at 10 7 CFU/ml were comparable with the untreated control. No significant differences, however, were noted in pod yield. The effectiveness of combining B. subtilis with selected organic-based products against the disease was also determined under greenhouse conditions. Based on AUDPC values, EYCO alone was the most effective followed by EYCO+garlic extract. However, B. subtilis+EYCO, and B. subtilis+baking soda were comparable to EYCO+garlic. On the other hand, B. subtilis+pepper was comparable to the untreated control. Interestingly, plants applied with EYCO+garlic, B. subtilis+EYCO, and B. subtilis+baking soda showed bigger leaves and more robust and longer stems compared with those treated with EYCO alone. Numerically, plants applied B. subtilis+EYCO gave the highest pod yield followed by EYCO+garlic, and B. subtilis+baking soda. Among the treated plants, EYCO alone gave the lowest pod yield. Follow up studies under field conditions are in progress to further validate these findings.",0
"Chile's seedling production industry has been growing for the last 10 years, and demand has actually reached 1250 million seedlings per year. This system has special relevance due to the high cost of seeds. In addition, there is an increasing demand for substituting synthetic agrochemicals. Therefore, the potential use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in tomato production has been investigated. Before sowing, the micro-organisms provided by Biogram S.A. were inoculated into the substrate diluted in 250 mL/L unchlorinated water. The experiment was laid out in a 'split-plot' design with the two plant substrates as main plots and the inoculants as subplots, including six replicates per treatment. Tomato seedlings were grown using two different plant substrates: a mixture of 70% peat and 30% perlite by volume, and a substrate with 20% peat, 20% perlite and 60% compost by volume, both inoculated with Bacillus subtilis or Pseudomonas fluorescens or Bioroot (R), which is a commercial product containing B. subtilis, P. fluorescens, Trichoderma harzianum, yeast, algae and Nocardia. For control, uninoculated tomato seedlings were grown on the respective plant substrates. Variance analysis did not identify significant interactions between substrate type (main plots) and inoculation treatment (subplots), P <= 0.05. There were significant differences between inoculants (P <= 0.05). Means were compared by using the Tukey's multiple range test. Tomato growth in terms of leaf area (cm(2)/plant) and shoot and root dry weight (g/10 plants) was improved for the seedlings grown on the substrate with 70% peat and 30% perlite, compared to the compost containing an alternative that is valid for both uninoculated perlite peat and all inoculated treatments where perlite peat was outstanding. Inoculation with Bioroot (R) improved the leaf area, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, radical contact area, volume of roots and root forks compared with the control without inoculation, when both plant substrates were analysed together. Thus, inoculation with Bioroot (R) can be recommended as an alternative to tomato seedling growers' dependence on synthetic agrochemicals.",0
"Background: Bacillus probiotics health benefits have been until now quite poorly studied in the elderly population. This study aimed to assess the effects of Bacillus subtilis CU1 consumption on immune stimulation and resistance to common infectious disease (CID) episodes in healthy free-living seniors. Results: One hundred subjects aged 60-74 were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arms study. Subjects consumed either the placebo or the probiotic (2.10(9) B. subtilis CU1 spores daily) by short periodical courses of 10 days intermittently, alternating 18-day course of break. This scheme was repeated 4 times during the study. Symptoms of gastrointestinal and upper/lower respiratory tract infections were recorded daily by the subjects throughout the study (4 months). Blood, saliva and stool samples were collected in a predefined subset of the first forty-four subjects enrolled in the study. B. subtilis CU1 supplementation did not statistically significantly decrease the mean number of days of reported CID symptoms over the 4-month of study (probiotic group: 5.1 (7.0) d, placebo group: 6.6 (7.3) d, P = 0.2015). However, in the subset of forty-four randomized subjects providing biological samples, we showed that consumption of B. subtilis CU1 significantly increased fecal and salivary secretory IgA concentrations compared to the placebo. A post-hoc analysis on this subset showed a decreased frequency of respiratory infections in the probiotc group compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: Taken together, our study provides evidence that B. subtilis CU1 supplementation during the winter period may be a safe effective way to stimulate immune responses in elderly subjects.",0
"OBJECTIVE To determine whether feeding a direct-fed microbial (DFM) to dairy calves would reduce total and antimicrobial-resistant coliform counts in feces and affect average daily gain (ADG). ANIMALS 21 preweaned Holstein heifer calves. PROCEDURES The study had a randomized complete block design. Within each block, 3 consecutively born calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups within 24 hours after birth (day 0). Calves were fed the DFM at 1.0 g (DFM1; n = 7) or 0.5 g (DFM2; 7) twice daily or no DFM (control; 7) from days 0 through 29. A fecal sample was collected from each calf daily on days 0 through 3 and then every other day through day 29. Fecal samples were cultured, and mean numbers of total coliforms and coliforms resistant to ampicillin, ceftiofur, and tetracycline were compared among the 3 treatment groups. Calves were weighed on days 0 and 29 to calculate ADG. RESULTS Mean total fecal coliform counts did not differ significantly among the 3 treatment groups. Mean ceftiofur-resistant and tetracycline-resistant coliform counts for the control group were significantly lower, compared with those for the DFM1 and DFM2 groups. Mean ADG did not differ significantly between the DFM1 and DFM2 groups; however, the mean ADG for all calves fed the DFM was 0.15 kg less than that for control calves. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that the DFM fed to the preweaned calves of this study did not reduce total or antimicrobial-resistant coliform counts in feces.",0
"Bacillus subtilis collectively inhabits the rhizosphere, where it contributes to the promotion of plant growth, although it does not have a direct symbiotic relationship to plants as observed in the case of rhizobia between leguminous plants. As rhizobia sense the flavonoids released from their host roots through the NodD transcriptional factor, which triggers transcription of the nod genes involved in the symbiotic processes, we supposed that B. subtilis utilizes certain flavonoids as signaling molecules to perceive and adapt to the rhizospheric environment that it is in. Our approaches to identify the flavonoid-responsive transcriptional regulatory system from B. subtilis resulted in the findings that three transcriptional factors (LmrA/QdoR, YetL, and Fur) are responsive to flavonoids, with the modes of action being different from each other. We also revealed a unique regulatory system by two transcriptional factors, YcnK and CsoR, for copper homeostasis in B. subtilis. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of these regulatory systems with the relevant information and discuss their physiological significances in the mutually beneficial interaction between B. subtilis and plants, considering the possibility of their application for plant cultivation.",0
"Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a method that uses fluorescent probes to detect specific nucleic acid sequences at the single-cell level. Here we describe optimized protocols that exploit a highly sensitive FISH method based on branched DNA technology to detect mRNA and miRNA in human leukocytes. This technique can be multiplexed and combined with fluorescent antibody protein staining to address a variety of questions in heterogeneous cell populations. We demonstrate antigen-specific upregulation of IFN gamma and IL-2 mRNAs in HIV- and CMV-specific T cells. We show simultaneous detection of cytokine mRNA and corresponding protein in single cells. We apply this method to detect mRNAs for which flow antibodies against the corresponding proteins are poor or are not available. We use this technique to show modulation of a microRNA critical for T-cell function, miR-155. We adapt this assay for simultaneous detection of mRNA and proteins by ImageStream technology.",0
"Enteric bacterial human pathogens, i.e., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, are the major cause of diarrheal infections in children and adults. Their structure badly affects the human immune system. It is important to explore new antibacterial agents instead of antibiotics for treatment. This project is an attempt to explain how gold nanoparticles affect these bacteria. We investigated the important role of the mean particle size, and the inhibition of a bacterium is dose-dependent. Ultra Violet (UV)-visible spectroscopy revealed the size of chemically synthesized gold nanoparticle as 6-40 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis confirmed the size and X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis determined the polycrystalline nature of gold nanoparticles. The present findings explained how gold nanoparticles lyse Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.",0
"A series of quinoline-based coumarin derivatives have been synthesized by one pot dehydrochlorination of 2,4-dichloroquinolines (1a-g); 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-2H-chromen-2-one (2) under ultrasonic irradiation method with high regio selectivity. All the synthesized compounds were characterized through spectral data and screened against representative antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Some of the compounds are found to be equipotent or more potent than that of standard drugs. Molecular docking studies show that the binding energy value of the compounds is very less than that of standard chloroquine and amodiaquine drugs.",0
"Spore-forming bacteria are a special problem for the food industry as some of them are able to survive preservation processes. Bacillus spp. spores can remain in a dormant, stress resistant state for a long period of time. Vegetative cells are formed by germination of spores followed by a more extended outgrowth phase. Spore germination and outgrowth progression are often very heterogeneous and therefore, predictions of microbial stability of food products are exceedingly difficult. Mechanistic details of the cause of this heterogeneity are necessary. In order to examine spore heterogeneity we made a novel closed air-containing chamber for live imaging. This chamber was used to analyze Bacillus subtilis spore germination, outgrowth, as well as subsequent vegetative growth. Typically, we examined around 90 starting spores/cells for >= 4 hours per experiment. Image analysis with the purposely built program ""SporeTracker"" allows for automated data processing from germination to outgrowth and vegetative doubling. In order to check the efficiency of the chamber, growth and division of B. subtilis vegetative cells were monitored. The observed generation times of vegetative cells were comparable to those obtained in well-aerated shake flask cultures. The influence of a heat stress of 85 degrees C for 10 min on germination, outgrowth, and subsequent vegetative growth was investigated in detail. Compared to control samples fewer spores germinated (41.1% less) and fewer grew out (48.4% less) after the treatment. The heat treatment had a significant influence on the average time to the start of germination (increased) and the distribution and average of the duration of germination itself (increased). However, the distribution and the mean outgrowth time and the generation time of vegetative cells, emerging from untreated and thermally injured spores, were similar.",0
"The antibacterial activity of the methanol extract of Wedelia chinensis leave was studied and tested against three pathogenic Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Stapylococcus aureus) and three pathogenic Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the disk diffusion assay and broth dilution methods. The extract exhibited favourable antibacterial activity against the bacterial cells but was more potent against Gram positive bacteria with the minimum inhibition concentration of 3.12 to 6.25 mg/ml compared to the Gram negative bacteria which had minimum inhibition concentration values of 25 mg/ml. The time-kill study suggested that the extract possessed bactericidal properties at higher concentrations and eradicated the growth of bacterial cells. The major abnormalities occurred to the bacterial cells after exposed to the extract were complete alterations in their morphology and collapsed of the cells beyond repair. The methanol extract of W. chinensis may be an effective antibacterial agent to treat bacterial infections.",0
"Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax is one of the most important biological warfare agents. In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology was used for indirect detection of B. anthracis by detecting protective antigen (PA), a common toxin produced by all live B. anthracis bacteria. For development of biosensor, a monoclonal antibody raised against B. anthracis PA was immobilized on carboxymethyldextran modified gold chip and its interaction with PA was characterized in situ by SPR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. By using kinetic evaluation software, K-D (equilibrium constant) and B-max (maximum binding capacity of analyte) were found to be 20 fM and 18.74, respectively. The change in Gibb's free energy (a dagger G = -78.04 kJ/mol) confirmed the spontaneous interaction between antigen and antibody. The assay could detect 12 fM purified PA. When anthrax spores spiked soil samples were enriched, PA produced in the sample containing even a single spore of B. anthracis could be detected by SPR. PA being produced only by the vegetative cells of B. anthracis, confirms indirectly the presence of B. anthracis in the samples. The proposed method can be a very useful tool for screening and confirmation of anthrax suspected environmental samples during a bio-warfare like situation.",0
"The concept of biological control for health maintenance has received widespread attention during the last few years. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to look for active substances that could be used as antibacterial agents. In the attempt of extracting and producing newly active antimicrobial substances substituting the existing overgrowing antibiotic microbial resistance, Spirulina platensis cyanobacterium was extracted with five different volatile organic solvents, acetone, methanol, petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol. Their antimicrobial effect was studied on gram positive such as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus xylosis obtained, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, MRSA ATCC 12498, and gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Escherichia coli ATCC 25966, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus feacalis ATCC 29212, Klebsiella pnumoniae ATCC 700603, Salmonella sp. (clinical isolate) and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Fusarium sp. (clinical isolate) using the agar well diffusion technique. Larger inhibition zone was observed with methanol S. platensis extract mainly on MRSA. The GC-MS analysis of S. platensis methanolic extract revealed the major active fatty acids constituents such a tetradecanoic acid and octadececanoic acid assumed to provide the antimicrobial activity.",0
"It is important to study the response of plant pathogens to the antibiosis traits of biocontrol microbes to design the efficient biocontrol strategies. In this study, we evaluated the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by a biocontrol strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR-9 on the growth and virulence traits of tomato wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum (RS). The VOCs of SQR-9 significantly inhibited the growth of RS on agar medium and in soil. In addition, the VOCs significantly inhibited the motility traits, production of antioxidant enzymes and exopolysaccharides, biofilm formation and tomato root colonization by RS. The strain SQR-9 produced 22 VOCs, but only nine VOCs showed 1-11% antibacterial activity against RS in their corresponding amounts; however, the consortium of all VOCs showed 70% growth inhibition of RS. The proteomics analysis showed that the VOCs of SQR-9 downregulated RS proteins related to the antioxidant activity, virulence, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, protein folding and translation, while the proteins involved in the ABC transporter system, amino acid synthesis, detoxification of aldehydes and ketones, methylation, protein translation and folding, and energy transfer were upregulated. This study describes the significance and effectiveness of VOCs produced by a biocontrol strain against tomato wilt pathogen.",0
"Protein-primed replication constitutes a generalized mechanism to initiate DNA or RNA synthesis in linear genomes, including viruses, gram-positive bacteria, linear plasmids and mobile elements. By this mechanism a specific amino acid primes replication and becomes covalently linked to the genome ends. Despite the fact that TPs lack sequence homology, they share a similar structural arrangement, with the priming residue in the C-terminal half of the protein and an accumulation of positively charged residues at the N-terminal end. In addition, various bacteriophage TPs have been shown to have DNA-binding capacity that targets TPs and their attached genomes to the host nucleoid. Furthermore, a number of bacteriophage TPs from different viral families and with diverse hosts also contain putative nuclear localization signals and localize in the eukaryotic nucleus, which could lead to the transport of the attached DNA. This suggests a possible role of bacteriophage TPs in prokaryote-to-eukaryote horizontal gene transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"SigmaB factor is an important regulatory factor for stress response in Gram-positive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. However, the activity of SigmaB factor is regulated by RsbV factor. Currently, the functional studies of RsbV factor are mostly focused on non-pathogenic B. subtilis, but the roles of RsbV factor in pathogenic L. monocytogenes during the regulation of environmental stress and virulence are still unclear. In the study, a a dagger RsbV mutant of L. monocytogenes was constructed to explore the regulatory role of RsbV in environmental stress and virulence. The environmental stress experiments indicated that the growth and survival capability of a dagger RsbV mutant obviously decreased in stress of low temperature, osmotic pressure, alcohol and acid, compared with EGD strain. The macrophage infection experiment indicated that a dagger RsbV mutant had weaker survival capability than EGD strain, and the expression of PrfA, actA, PlcA and LLO was down-regulated in infected cells. Animal inoculation experiments indicated that RsbV deletion significantly reduced the pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes. Our data demonstrate that, in addition to regulating tolerance under environmental stress conditions, RsbV also contributes to regulation of L. monocytogenes virulence.",0
"New transition metal complexes [M(L)Cl(H2O)] (M(II) = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) with a ligand (HL) derived from the condensation of cephaclor antibiotic with 1,2-diaminobenzene, were synthesized and characterized on the basis of analytical and spectral data. The ligand and the complexes were tested for their antimicrobial activity against several bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031 Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 497, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and Escherichia coli ATCC 35939 to assess their inhibiting potential.",0
"New Bacillus licheniformis strain named V9T14 that produces a new biosurfactant composition that is effective against colonization and/or bio film formation from bacteria.

"Tobacco bacterial wilt (TBW) is caused by Ralstonia solanacearum (R. solanacearum), a severe pathogenic agent with a wide host range. In this study, lime + ammonium bicarbonate (L + AB), organic fertilizer (OF), bio-organic fertilizer (BOF), and integrated treatment (L + AB + BOF) were assessed for the ability to control TBW and to influence the composition of native soil bacterial communities. The results showed that disease incidence of L + AB + BOF for two growth seasons in pot experiment was the lowest, with only 15.56 and 11.11 % at seasons 1 and 2, respectively. The integrated treatment could also significantly suppress TBW in the field, with a disease incidence of only 14.27 % compared with 35.41, 50.03, and 31.32 % in L + AB, OF, and BOF treatments, respectively. With application of the integrated treatment in pot and field experiments, the abundances of R. solanacearum were both significantly lower than those with other treatments. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns showed that application of BOF significantly affected composition of bacterial communities of rhizosphere. The analysis of 454 sequencing data showed that application of integrated treatment recruited more beneficial bacteria than other treatments, such as Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Arthrobacter, and Streptomyces, while the abundance of Ralstonia with the integrated treatment was decreased. Overall, these results suggested that application of integrated agricultural management could effectively suppress bacterial wilt by affecting the composition of bacterial community and reducing the population of R. solanacearum.",0
"In recent time, there is a major concern about antibiotic resistance displayed by some pathogenic microorganisms and this had involved a continuous search for natural antimicrobial products. The phytochemistry as well as antimicrobial activity of extracts obtained from Lenzites quercina was investigated. The extracts and purified fractions were, respectively, tested against indicator organisms using agar well diffusion and disc diffusion methods. The quantity of phytochemicals found in the extracts of L. quercina ranged from 14.4 to 20.7 mg/g for alkaloids, 6.1 to 12.8 mg/g for steroids, 4.5 to 10.6 mg/g for saponins, 2.8 to 17.2 mg/g for terpenoids, and 0.41 to 17.1 mg/g for flavonoids. The gas chromatography mass spectrophotometry (GCMS) analysis of the extract reveals the presence of caprylic acid, stearic acid, tetradecanoic acid, methyl-11-octadecenoate, oleic acid, and 4-methyl-2-propyl-1-pentanol. Extracts of L. quercina and its purified fractions exhibited wider range of inhibition (4 mm to 26 mm) on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The antimicrobial effects of L. quercina extracts indicate that this wild macrofungus contains significant amount of pharmacological agents, which could be extracted to curb the menace of antibiotic resistances by pathogenic organisms.",0
"Recent studies have demonstrated that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) significantly alter the magnitude and distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in receiving environments, indicating that wastewater treatment represents an important node for limiting ARG dissemination. This study examined the potential for membrane treatment of microconstituent ARGs and the effect of native wastewater colloids on the extent of their removal. Plasmids containing vanA (vancomycin) and bla(TEM) (beta-lactam) ARGs were spiked into three representative WWTP effluents versus a control buffer and tracked by quantitative polymerase chain reaction through a cascade of microfiltration and ultrafiltration steps ranging from 0.45 mu m to 1 kDa. Significant removal of ARGs was achieved by membranes of 100 kDa and smaller, and presence of wastewater colloids resulted in enhanced removal by 10 kDa and 1 kDa membranes. ARG removal was observed to correlate significantly with the corresponding protein, polysaccharide, and total organic carbon colloidal fractions. Alumina membranes removed ARGs to a greater extent than polyvinylidene fluoride membranes of the same pore size (0.1 mu m), but only in the presence of wastewater material. Control studies confirmed that membrane treatment was the primary mechanism of ARG removal, versus other potential sources of loss. This study suggests that advanced membrane treatment technology is promising for managing public health risks of ARGs in wastewater effluents and that removal may even be enhanced by colloids in real-world wastewaters.

"Assays for bacterial ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNA) have been shown to distinguish viable from inactivated bacterial cells in drinking water samples. Because the synthesis of pre-rRNA is rapidly induced by nutritional stimulation, viable bacteria can be distinguished from inactivated cells and free nucleic acids by measuring the production of species-specific pre-rRNA in samples that have been briefly stimulated with nutrients. Here, pre-rRNA analysis was applied to bacteria from serum, a human sample matrix. In contrast to drinking water, serum is rich in nutrients that might be expected to mask the effects of nutritional stimulation. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were used to detect pre-rRNA of four bacterial species: Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. These species were chosen for their clinical significance and phylogenetic diversity (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria). To maximize resolving power, pre-rRNA was normalized to genomic DNA of each pathogen. When viable cells were shifted from serum to bacteriological culture medium, rapid replenishment of pre-rRNA was always observed. Cells of P. aeruginosa that were inactivated in the presence of serum exhibited no pre-rRNA response to nutritional stimulation, despite strong genomic DNA signals in these samples. When semi-automated methods were used, pre-rRNA analysis detected viable A. baumannii cells in serum at densities of <= 100 CFU/mL in <5.5 hours. Originally developed for rapid microbiological analysis of drinking water, ratiometric pre-rRNA analysis can also assess the viability of bacterial cells derived from human specimens, without requiring bacteriological culture.",0
"The phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the plant growth promoting Bacillus genus have been widely investigated in the rhizosphere of various agricultural crops. However, to our knowledge this is the first report on the Bacillus species isolated from the rhizosphere of Calendula officinalis. 15 % of the isolated bacteria were screened for their important antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium cucumerinium and Alternaria alternata. The bacteria identification based on 16S r-RNA and gyrase-A genes analysis, revealed strains closely related to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. velezensis, B. subtilis sub sp spizezenii and Paenibacillus polymyxa species. The electro-spray mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (ESI-LC MS) analysis showed that most of the Bacillus isolates produced the three lipopeptides families. However, the P. polymyxa (18SRTS) didn't produce any type of lipopeptides. All the tested Bacillus isolates produced cellulase but the protease activity was observed only in the B. amyloliquefaciens species (9SRTS). The Salkowsky colorimetric test showed that the screened bacteria synthesized 6-52 mu g/ml of indole 3 acetic acid. These bacteria produced siderophores with more than 10 mm wide orange zones on chromazurol S. The greenhouse experiment using a naturally infested soil with Sclerotonia sclerotiorum showed that the B. amyloliquefaciens (9SRTS) had no significant (P > 0.05) effect on the pre-germination of the chickpea seeds. However, it increased the size of the chickpea plants and reduced the stem rot disease (P < 0.05).These results suggested that the Bacillus strains isolated in this work may be further used as bioinoculants to improve the production of C. officinalis and other crop systems.",0
"In the present study, the antiviral properties of the bacteriocin subtilosin against Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and the safety and efficacy of a subtilosin-based nanofiber formulation were determined. High concentrations of subtilosin, the cyclical antimicrobial peptide produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, were virucidal against HSV-1. Interestingly, at non-virucidal concentrations, subtilosin inhibited wild type HSV-1 and aciclovir-resistant mutants in a dose-dependent manner. Although the exact antiviral mechanism is not fully understood, time of addition experiments and western blot analysis suggest that subtilosin does not affect viral multiplication steps prior to protein synthesis. Poly(vinyl alcohol)-based subtilosin nanofibers with a width of 278 nm were produced by the electrospinning process. The retained antimicrobial activity of the subtilosin-based fibers was determined via an agar well diffusion assay. The loading capacity of the fibers was 2.4 mg subtilosin/g fiber, and loading efficiency was 31.6 %. Furthermore, the nanofibers with and without incorporated subtilosin were shown to be non-toxic to human epidermal tissues using an in vitro human tissue model. Taking together these results, subtilosin-based nanofibers should be further studied as a novel alternative method for treatment and/or control of HSV-1 infection.",0
"The guanosine 3,5-bisdiphosphate (ppGpp) signaling system is shared by bacteria and plant chloroplasts, but its role in plants has remained unclear. Here we show that guanylate kinase (GK), a key enzyme in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis that catalyzes the conversion of GMP to GDP, is a target of regulation by ppGpp in chloroplasts of rice, pea, and Arabidopsis. Plants have two distinct types of GK that are localized to organelles (GKpm) or to the cytosol (GKc), with both enzymes being essential for growth and development. We found that the activity of rice GKpm in vitro was inhibited by ppGpp with a K-i of 2.8 m relative to the substrate GMP, whereas the K-m of this enzyme for GMP was 73 m. The IC50 of ppGpp for GKpm was approximate to 10 m. In contrast, the activity of rice GKc was insensitive to ppGpp, as was that of GK from bakers' yeast, which is also a cytosolic enzyme. These observations suggest that ppGpp plays a pivotal role in the regulation of GTP biosynthesis in chloroplasts through specific inhibition of GKpm activity, with the regulation of GTP biosynthesis in chloroplasts thus being independent of that in the cytosol. We also found that GKs of Escherichia coli and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 are insensitive to ppGpp, in contrast to the ppGpp sensitivity of the Bacillus subtilis enzyme. Our biochemical characterization of GK enzymes has thus revealed a novel target of ppGpp in chloroplasts and has uncovered diversity among bacterial GKs with regard to regulation by ppGpp.",0
"One of the key determinants of the size, composition, structure, and development of a microbial community is the predation pressure by bacteriophages. Accordingly, bacteria have evolved a battery of antiphage defense strategies. Since maintaining constantly elevated defenses is costly, we hypothesize that some bacteria have additionally evolved the abilities to estimate the risk of phage infection and to adjust their strategies accordingly. One risk parameter is the density of the bacterial population. Hence, quorum sensing, i.e., the ability to regulate gene expression according to population density, may be an important determinant of phage-host interactions. This hypothesis was investigated in the model system of Escherichia coli and phage lambda. We found that, indeed, quorum sensing constitutes a significant, but so far overlooked, determinant of host susceptibility to phage attack. Specifically, E. coli reduces the numbers of lambda receptors on the cell surface in response to N-acyl-L-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signals, causing a 2-fold reduction in the phage adsorption rate. The modest reduction in phage adsorption rate leads to a dramatic increase in the frequency of uninfected survivor cells after a potent attack by virulent phages. Notably, this mechanism may apply to a broader range of phages, as AHLs also reduce the risk of chi phage infection through a different receptor. IMPORTANCE To enable the successful manipulation of bacterial populations, a comprehensive understanding of the factors that naturally shape microbial communities is required. One of the key factors in this context is the interactions between bacteria and the most abundant biological entities on Earth, namely, the bacteriophages that prey on bacteria. This proof-of-principle study shows that quorum sensing plays an important role in determining the susceptibility of E. coli to infection by bacteriophages lambda and chi. On the basis of our findings in the classical Escherichia coli-lambda model system, we suggest that quorum sensing may serve as a general strategy to protect bacteria specifically under conditions of high risk of infection.",0
"Cecropin A-melittin (CAM), a chimeric antimicrobial peptide with potent antimicrobial activity, is threatened by some special extracellular proteases when used to deal with certain drug-resistant pathogenic microbes in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, a four-tryptophan-substitution mutant (CAM-W) from CAM was developed via the replacement of special amino acid residues to enhance the antimicrobial potency and to improve the proteolytic stability of this agent. The pharmaceutical index of CAM-W was investigated, with a focus on biological potency, cytotoxicity, and proteolytic stability, as well as pH and thermal resistance. CAM-W exhibited potent antimicrobial activity and was approximately 3-12 times higher than that of CAM. CAM-W also exhibited a strong antifungal activity against a series of common pathogenic fungi, in a lower IC50 range between 2.1 mg/L and 3.3 mg/L than that of its reference CAM ranging from 9.8 mg/L to 14.2 mg/L. Besides, CAM-W showed moderate cytotoxicity (IC50 > 300 mg/L) in erythrocyte lysis test. In addition, CAM-W overcame challenges under various conditions, including specific temperatures (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 degrees C), pH values (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, and 9.0), and proteases (trypsin, pepsin, human neutrophil elastase, Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease) that are commonly present in human gastrointestinal tract. These results suggest that the four-tryptophan-substitution can confer CAM-W with a high pharmaceutical index, which is important for CAM-W to become a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics against bacteria and fungi associated with gastroenteritis.

"Mucosal surfaces of fish, including skin, gill and gut, contain numerous immune substances poorly studied that act as the first line of defence against a broad spectrum of pathogens. This study aimed to identify and characterize for the first time different constitutive humoral defence mechanisms of the skin mucus of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). To do this, the levels of total immunoglobulin M, several enzymes and proteins (peroxidase, lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, esterases, proteases and anti-proteases), as well as the bactericidal activity against opportunist fish pathogens (Vibrio hanrveyi, Vibrio angillarum, Photobacterium damselae) and non-pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis) were measured in the skin mucus and compared with those found in the serum. This study demonstrates that gilthead seabream skin mucus contains lower levels of IgM, similar levels of lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase and proteases, and higher esterase, peroxidase and antiprotease activities than serum. In addition, skin mucus revealed stronger bactericidal activity against tested fish pathogen bacteria compared to the serum activity, while human bacteria can even grow more in the presence of mucus. The results could be useful for better understanding the role of the skin mucus as a key component of the innate immune system with potential application for the aquaculture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Periodontitis is caused by multi-bacterial infection and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis are closely associated with inflammatory periodontal diseases. Although lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of A. actinomycetemcomitans (Aa.LPS) and lipoteichoic acid of E. faecalis (Ef.LTA) are considered to be major virulence factors evoking inflammatory responses, their combinatorial effect on the induction of chemokines has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the interaction between Aa.LPS and Ef.LTA on IL-8 expression in human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. Aa.LPS, but not Ef.LTA, substantially induced IL-8 expression at the protein and mRNA levels. Interestingly, Ef.LTA suppressed Aa.LPS-induced IL-8 expression without affecting the binding of Aa.LPS to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. Ef.LTA reduced Aa.LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, including ERK, JNK and p38 kinase. Furthermore, Ef.LTA inhibited the Aa.LPS-induced transcriptional activities of the activating protein 1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and nuclear factor-kappa B transcription factors, all of which are known to regulate IL-8 gene expression. Ef.LTA augmented the expression of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-M (IRAK-M), a negative regulator of TLR intracellular signaling pathways, in the presence of Aa.LPS at both the mRNA and protein levels. Small interfering RNA silencing IRAK-M reversed the attenuation of Aa.LPS-induced IL-8 expression by Ef.LTA. Collectively, these results suggest that Ef.LTA down-regulates Aa.LPS-induced IL-8 expression in human PDL cells through up-regulation of the negative regulator IRAK-M.",0
"Increasing a ceiling fan's speed from its lowest setting of 61 rpm, which resulted in 0.77 m(3)/s of airflow, to its highest setting of 176 rpm, which resulted in 2.5 m(3)/s of airflow, or having the fan blow either upward or downward had no statistically significant effect on the efficacy of upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). This outcome suggests that air circulation due to the ceiling fan was sufficient and that any additional increase would not improve efficacy. Numerous experimental studies on upper-room UVGI in which fans were used to provide air mixing have been published. However, none have quantified the air movement produced by these fans or described their tests in sufficient detail to allow results to be compared to predictions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The present work provides the required information. In addition to the usual boundary conditions needed for CFD, we made experimental measurements of UV susceptibility of the microorganisms used in the upper-room UVGI tests. We measured UV susceptibilities for Mycobacterium parafortuitum and Bacillus atrophaeus spores to be 0.074 and 0.018 m(2)/J, respectively. In a previous publication, we reported the spatial distribution of fluence rate, which is also needed for predicting efficacy from CFD. In a companion paper referred to as Part II, upper-room UVGI efficacy was predicted by both Eulerian and Lagrangian CFD and compared to the experimental results from the present study.

"Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles has provoked nowadays and alternative to physical and chemical approaches. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized extracellular method using Bacillus megaterium. The AgNPs formations were confirmed initially through color change, and the aliquots were characterized through UV-visible spectrophotometer, followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The surface plasmon resonance band was shown at 430 nm in UV-vis spectrophotometer. The bioreduction was categorized through identifying the compounds responsible for the AgNP synthesis, and the functional group present in B. megaterium cell-free culture was scrutinized using FTIR. The topography and morphology of the particles were determined using SEM. In addition, this biosynthesized AgNPs were found to show higher insecticidal efficacy against vector mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 were found to be 0.567, 2.260; 0.90, 4.44; 1.349, 8.269; and 1.640, 9.152 and 0.240, 0.955; 0.331, 1.593; 0.494, 2.811; and 0.700, 4.435 with respect to the first, second, third, and fourth instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. All the calculated chi (2) values are highly significant compared with the tabulated value. Therefore, B. megaterium-synthesized silver nanoparticles would be used as a potent larvicidal agent against Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti.",0
"Emerging resistance to current antibiotics raises the need for new microbial drug targets. We show that targeting branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis using sulfonylurea herbicides, which inhibit the BCAA biosynthetic enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), can exert bacteriostatic effects on several pathogenic bacteria, including Burkholderia pseudomallei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Our results suggest that targeting biosynthetic enzymes like AHAS, which are lacking in humans, could represent a promising antimicrobial drug strategy.",0
"Aims: The study was conducted to develop the protocol for callus culture, cell suspension culture and to determine antibacterial activity of Ricinus communis L. cv. Roktima in cell extract. Study Design: Hypocotyl segments used as explants in callus culture and agar disk diffusion method used for antibacterial activity test. Place and Duration of Study: Institute of Biological Sciences, Rajshahi University, Rajshahi, Bangladesh during the period of 2010-2012. Methodology: MS medium supplemented with different growth regulators were used for callus induction and cell culture and paper disc diffusion method was used for the determination of antibacterial activities. Growth inhibition was determined against five gram positive bacteria viz., Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtillus, Bacillus halodurans, six gram negative bacteria viz., Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella species, Proteus species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi by using disc diffusion and micro broth dilution techniques. Results: Auxins NAA, 2,4-D and IAA played a great role in callus induction but 2.0 mg/L BAP+0.5 mg/L NAA and 2.0 mg/L BAP+0.8 mg/L NAA concentrations proved to be most suitable combinations for induction of callus in R. communis L. cv. Roktima. Cells were cultured on the MS medium having 2.0 mg/L BAP+0.2 mg/L NAA in which the rate of cell growth found highest and the cell continued to grow until 14 days. The peak period of cell growth was observed from 4th d to 6th d. Antimicrobial test with eleven bacteria demonstrated that the extracts of cell suspension culture of R. communis L. cv. Roktima holds the merit of antimicrobial activity and it was considered to be the potent source of antibacterial compounds and a possible source for obtaining the toxin ricin. Conclusion: In summary, the results obtained in the present investigation demonstrated that the extracts of cell suspension culture of R. communis L. cv. Roktima had the antibacterial activity and considered to be the potent source of antibacterial compounds.",0
"The antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of Bacillus subtilis strain KKU213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) of a KKU213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial activity of the CFS precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (AS) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees C, at pH 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and overlaid with the indicator strains B. cereus and S. aureus, the 40% AS precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kDa. However, proteins larger than 25 kDa and smaller than 10 kDa were still observed on a native protein gel. Purified subtilosin A was prepared by Amberlite XAD-16 bead extraction and HPLC and analyzed by Nano-LC-QTOF-MS. Its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kDa, and it retained its antibacterial activity. These results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin A gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the KKU213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of B. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. In addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin A, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the KKU213 culture. The KKU213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is highly acid-resistant (pH 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. Therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing B. subtilis KKU213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",0
"The current experiment was conducted to construct recombinant Bacillus subtilis WB600 expressing Eimeria tenella 3-1E protein to investigate the oral immunization protective effects against E. tenella. The merozoite surface antigen 3-1E gene of E. tenella was introduced into the pBS-H1 expression vector with a novel signal peptide sequence. After the electro-transformation, the expression of objective protein in B. subtilis WB600 was detected by Western blot. The results showed that the recombinant B. subtilis strain with the ability of high-level secretion of 3-1E was constructed successfully. Seven-day-old broiler chickens were orally vaccinated with B. subtilis WB600 harboring 3-1E (B.S-pBS-H1-3-1E) or B. subtilis WB600 with empty plasmid (B.S-pBS-H1) 10 days prior to challenge with sporulated E. tenella oocysts. The results showed the recombinant B. subtilis strain with the ability of high-level secretion of 3-1E was constructed successfully. Vaccination with B.S-pBS-H1-3-1E strain significantly increased the anti-coccidial index and reduced cecal lesion scores compared with the positive control group (chickens were challenged with sporulated E. tenella oocysts without oral administration of B.S-pBS-H1-3-1E strain) and B.S-pBS-H1 group. Ceca mucosal sIgA, secretion, and IL-2, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 level after challenge were greater in the B.S-pBS-H1-3-1E group than in the positive control group. Taken together, these results indicated that B. subtilis WB600 harboring 3-1E protein induces protective immunity against E. tenella.",0
"Microbes are incessantly challenged by both biotic and abiotic stressors threatening their existence. Therefore, bacterial pathogens must possess mechanisms to successfully subvert host immune defenses as well as overcome the stress associated with host-cell encounters. To achieve this, bacterial pathogens typically experience a genetic re-programming whereby anti-host/stress factors become expressed and eventually translated into effector proteins. In that vein, the bacterial host-cell induced stress-response is similar to any other abiotic stress to which bacteria respond by up-regulating specific stress-responsive genes. Following the stress encounter, bacteria must degrade unnecessary stress responsive transcripts through RNA decay mechanisms. The three pathogenic yersiniae (Yersinia pestis, Y pseudo-tuberculosis, and Y enterocolitica) are all psychrotropic bacteria capable of growth at 4 C; however, cold growth is dependent on the presence of an exoribonuclease, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). PNPase has also been implicated as a virulence factor in several notable pathogens including the salmonellae, Helicobacter pylori, and the yersiniae [where it typically influences the type three secretion system (TTSS)]. Further, PNPase has been shown to associate with ribonuclease E (endoribonuclease), RhIB (RNA helicase), and enolase (glycolytic enzyme) in several Gram-negative bacteria forming a large, multi-protein complex known as the RNA degradosome. This review will highlight studies demonstrating the influence of PNPase on the virulence potentials and stress responses of various bacterial pathogens as well as focusing on the degradosome-dependent and -independent roles played by PNPase in yersiniae stress responses.",0
"The investigation of self-resistance in antibiotic producers is important to understand the emergence of antibiotic resistance in pathogens and to improve antibiotic production. Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antibiotics that mostly target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The actinomycete Microbispora ATCC PTA-5024 produces the lantibiotic NAI-107, which interferes with peptidoglycan biosynthesis by binding bactoprenol-pyrophosphate-coupled peptidoglycan precursors. In order to understand how Microbispora counteracts the action of its own antibiotic, its peptidoglycan composition was analysed in detail. Microbispora peptidoglycan consists of muropeptides with D-Ala and Gly in similar proportion at the fourth position of the peptide stems and alternative 3-3 cross-links besides the classical 4-3 cross-links. In addition, the NAI-107 biosynthetic gene cluster (mlb) was analysed for the expression of immunity proteins. We show that distinct immunity determinants are encoded in the mlb cluster: the ABC transporter MlbYZ acting cooperatively with the transmembrane protein MlbJ and the lipoprotein MlbQ. NMR structural analysis of MlbQ revealed a hydrophobic surface patch, which is proposed to bind the cognate lantibiotic. This study demonstrates that immunity in Microbispora is not only based on one determinant but on the action of the distinct immunity proteins MlbQ, MlbYZ and MlbJ.",0
"The genes of collagen-like proteins (CLPs) have been identified in a broad range of bacteria, including some human pathogens. They are important for biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion to host cells in some human pathogenic bacteria, including several Bacillus spp. strains. Interestingly, some bacterial CLP-encoding genes (clps) have also been found in non-human pathogenic strains such as B. cereus and B. amyloliquefaciens, which are types of plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). In this study, we investigated a putative cluster of clps in B. amyloliquefaciens strain FZB42 and a collagen-related structuralmotif containing glycine-X-threonine repeats was found in the genes RBAM_007740, RBAM_007750, RBAM_007760, and RBAM_007770. Interestingly, biofilm formation was disrupted when these genes were inactivated separately. Scanning electronmicroscopy and hydrophobicity value detection were used to assess the bacterial cell shape morphology and cell surface architecture of clps mutant cells. The results showed that the CLPs appeared to have roles in bacterial autoaggregation, as well as adherence to the surface of abiotic materials and the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. Thus, we suggest that the CLPs located in the outer layer of the bacterial cell (including the cell wall, outer membrane, flagella, or other associated structures) play important roles in biofilm formation and bacteria-plant interactions. This is the first study to analyze the function of a collagen-like motif-containing protein in a PGPR bacterium. Knocking out each clp gene produced distinctive morphological phenotypes, which demonstrated that each product may play specific roles in biofilm formation. Our in silico analysis suggested that these four tandemly ranked genes might not belong to an operon, but further studies are required at the molecular level to test this hypothesis. These results provide insights into the functions of clps during interactions between bacteria and plants.",1
"Eighty Lohmann White laying hens were used to investigate the effect of dietary inclusion of Bacillus subtilis and inulin, individually or in combination, on egg production, eggshell quality, tibia traits, Ca retention, and small intestine morphology and microflora composition from 64 to 75 weeks of age. Hens were randomly distributed into 4 treatment groups, with 5 replicates per treatment and 4 hens per replicate. Treatment groups were fed basal diet (control), basal diet plus 1 g/kg B. subtilis (2.3 x 10(8) cfu/g), basal diet plus 1 g/kg inulin, or basal diet plus a synbiotic combination of 1 g/kg B. subtilis (2.3 X 10(8) cfu/g) and 1 g/kg inulin. Dietary supplementation of B. subtilis, inulin or synbiotic improved (P<0.05) feed conversion, egg performance, eggshell quality and calcium retention compared with the control. B. subtilis and synbiotic groups exhibited the highest (P<0.05) increase in egg production and egg weight. Inulin and synbiotic groups exhibited the highest (P<0.05) increase in eggshell thickness and eggshell calcium content, and the lowest (P<0.05) eggshell deformations. Unmarketable eggs were 8.4% (P<0.05) of the total eggs produced by the control group compared to 3.5%, 1.7%, and 1.5% for the B. subtilis, inulin and synbiotic groups, respectively. Tibia density, ash, and Ca content increased (P<0.05) by inulin and synbiotic inclusions, compared with the control. B. subtilis, inulin, and their synbiotic combination increased (P<0.05) villus height and crypt depth in all intestinal segments, compared with the control. B. subtilis and inulin modulated the ileal and caecal microflora composition by decreasing (P<0.05) numbers of Clostridium and Conforms and increasing (P<0.05) numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, compared with the control. Colonization of the beneficial microflora along with increasing the villi-crypts absorptive area were directly associated with the improvements in performance and eggshell quality. It can be concluded that egg production and eggshell quality of laying hens can be improved (P<0.05) in the late phase of production by dietary inclusion of B. subtilis and inulin.

"Natural competence, the ability of bacteria to take up exogenous DNA and incorporate it into their chromosomes, is in most bacteria a transient phenomenon under complex genetic and environmental control. In the Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae, the master regulator Sxy/TfoX controls competence development. Although not known to be naturally competent, Escherichia coli possesses a Sxy homologue and a competence regulon containing the genes required for DNA uptake. Here, we show that in contrast to other characterised Gamma-proteobacteria, E.coliSxy is positively autoregulated at the level of transcription by a mechanism that requires cAMP rotein (CRP), cyclic AMP (cAMP) and a CRP-S site in the sxy promoter. Similarly, we found no evidence that Sxy expression in E.coli was regulated at the translational level. However, our analysis revealed that Sxy is an unstable protein and that its cellular level is negatively regulated at the post-translational level via degradation by Lon protease. Interestingly, in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, the competence master regulator ComK is also positively autoregulated at the level of transcription and negatively regulated by proteolysis. Together, these findings reveal striking similarities between the competence regulons of a Gram-positive and a Gram-negative bacterium.",0
"Glyphosate is an organophosphorus insecticide widely used as a herbicide. The intensive use of herbicides in agricultural soils is a matter of environmental concern. Glyphosate is toxic to environment, exploration of various glyphosate degrading bacteria to clean-up the pesticides is of immense importance. Four bacterial isolates were successfully isolated from glyphosate contaminated soil and were named GP-1, GP-2, GP-3 and GP-4. The isolates were capable of utilizing glyphosate as the sole source of carbon and were able to grow at 1000 mg/l concentrations of glyphosate. Effect of environmental conditions like temperature, pH and NaCl concentration was determined for all bacterial isolates. Most of bacterial isolates showed susceptibility for different antibiotics in antibiotic sensitivity test. Growth kinetics experiments showed that the bacterial isolates were able to grow in medium containing the glyphosate as the carbon source. Out of four bacterial isolates GP-4 was identified based on16S rRNA sequence analysis.",0
"Despite the noxious effects inflicted by Dinoponera ant's envenomation, the information about the biological properties and composition of their venom is still very limited. Ants from the genus Dinoponera are believed to be the world's largest living ants with a body length of 3 cm. Their occurrence is restricted to tropical areas of South America. In this work, we study-the venom of the giant Dinoponera quadriceps ant collected in 4 different regions of Brazil. By using a combination of complementary mass spectrometric approaches, we aim at: (i) characterizing the venom composition of these ants; (ii) establishing a comparative analysis of the venom from four geographically different regions in Brazil. This approach demonstrates that ant venom is a copious source of new compounds. Several peptides were identified and selected for ""de novo sequencing"". Since most of the new peptides showed similarities with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), antimicrobial assays were performed with the purpose of evaluating their activity. In regard to the comparative study of the four regions, we observed not only major differences in the venom compositions, but also that the venoms collected in closest areas are more similar than the ones collected in distant regions. These observations seem to highlight an adaption of the ant venoms to the local environment. Concerning the biological assays, the peptides called Dq-3162 and Da-3177 showed a wide-ranging antimicrobial activity. The characterization of new AMPs with a broad spectrum of activity and different scaffolds may aid scientists to design new therapeutic agents and understand the mechanisms of those peptides to interact with microbial membranes. The results obtained betoken the biotechnological potential of ant's venom. Biological significance For the first time this manuscript describes an extensive proteomics characterization of the D. quadriceps venom. In addition this study reports the variation in venom composition of primitive ants from 4 geographically different areas of Brazil. The results reveal the presence of similar to 335 compounds for each venom/area and inter-colony variations were observed. 16 new peptides were characterized and 2 of them were synthesized and biologically assayed. These findings highlight the considerable and still unexplored diversity of ant's venom which could be used as valuable research tools in different areas of knowledge. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Biofilms are communities of microbial cells that underpin diverse processes including sewage bioremediation, plant growth promotion, chronic infections and industrial biofouling. The cells resident in the biofilm are encased within a self- produced exopolymeric matrix that commonly comprises lipids, proteins that frequently exhibit amyloid- like properties, eDNA and exopolysaccharides. This matrix fulfils a variety of functions for the community, from providing structural rigidity and protection from the external environment to controlling gene regulation and nutrient adsorption. Critical to the development of novel strategies to control biofilm infections, or the capability to capitalize on the power of biofilm formation for industrial and biotechnological uses, is an in- depth knowledge of the biofilm matrix. This is with respect to the structure of the individual components, the nature of the interactions between the molecules and the three- dimensional spatial organization. We highlight recent advances in the understanding of the structural and functional role that carbohydrates and proteins play within the biofilm matrix to provide three- dimensional architectural integrity and functionality to the biofilm community. We highlight, where relevant, experimental techniques that are allowing the boundaries of our understanding of the biofilm matrix to be extended using Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Bacillus subtilis as exemplars.",0
"The antimicrobial activity of quaternary ammonium salts of pyridinium oxime against four food pathogenic bacteria, the Gram positive Bacillus subtilis and Listeria monocytogenes, as well as the Gram negative Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica, were evaluated. Changes of proteome in these bacteria grown under stress conditions were identified. By the application of a new method for sample preparation, followed by both in-gel and in-solution digestion and LC-MS/MS, both characterization and comparison of proteomes of these food pathogens were achieved. It was shown in all investigated bacteria that some of the proteins of key importance for protein turnover and bacterial metabolism are down regulated. Some stress proteins involved in protein folding and degradation were up regulated. Most of both up- and down-regulated proteins belong to the group of proteins with high abundance. Flagellin is the only protein of lower abundance that was found to be down regulated in two strains, B. subtilis and E. coli. The presented results give the better view into the proteome of food pathogens, and pave the way for further investigation of their virulence, pathogenicity and detection of biomarkers for tracing the ways and sources of food contamination.

"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are pattern recognition molecules of innate immunity. In this study, a long-form PGRP, designated as gcPGRP6, was identified from grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella. The deduced amino acid sequence of gcPGRP6 is composed of 464 residues with a conserved PGRP domain at the C-terminus. The gcPGRP6 gene consists of four exons and three introns, spacing approximately 2.7 kb of genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that gcPGRP6 is clustered closely with zebrafish PGLYRP6, and formed a long-type PGRP subfamily together with PGLYRP2 members identified in teleosts and mammals. Real-time PCR and Western blotting analyses revealed that gcPGRP6 is constitutively expressed in organs/tissues examined, and its expression was significantly induced in liver and intestine of grass carp in response to PGN stimulation and in CIK cells treated with lipoteichoic acid (LTA), polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and peptidoglycan (PGN). Immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blotting analyses revealed that gcPGRP6 is effectively secreted to the exterior of CIK cells. The over-expression of gcPGRP6 in CIK cells leads to the activation of NF-kappa B and the inhibition of intracellular bacterial growth. Moreover, cell lysates from CIK cells transfected with pTurbo-gcPGRP6-GFP plasmid display the binding activity towards Lys-type PGN from Staphylococcus aureus and DAP-type PGN from Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokine IL-2 and intracellular PGN receptor NOD2 had a significantly increased expression in CIK cells overexpressed with gcPGRP6. It is demonstrated that the PGRP6 in grass carp has a role in binding PGN, in inhibiting the growth of intracellular bacteria, and in activating NF-kappa B, as well as in regulating innate immune genes.

"Insecticide efficacy of Beauveria bassiana conidia was improved by optimizing the concentrations of conidial heat-protective saccharides (glucose, sucrose, maltose, trehalose, alpha-lactose, and mannitol) using response surface methodology. Two field trials in tea gardens were carried out to control leafhopper (Empoasca vitis) by spraying B. bassiana conidia together with the optimized saccharides (0.26 g glucose, 0.28 g lactose, 0.24 g mannitol per ml). In the field studies, B. bassiana conidia were applied to control Empoasca vitis with and without saccharides and compared with bifenthrin, a pyrethroid insecticide. With the optimal concentrations of saccharides, the conidial germination rate reached 72 % and the control efficacy of the saccharides group (65.7 %) was equal to the bifenthrin group (69.4 %), which improved by about 55 %.",0
"Infections caused by hard-to-treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are a serious global public-health concern, as MRSA has become broadly resistant to many classes of antibiotics. We disclose herein the discovery of a new class of non-beta-lactam antibiotics, the oxadiazoles, which inhibit penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) of MRSA. The oxadiazoles show bactericidal activity against vancomycin-and linezolid-resistant MRSA and other Gram-positive bacterial strains, in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of infection, and have 100% oral bioavailability.",0
"Thirty thiazole compounds bearing chemotherapeutically-active pharmacophores were synthesized and evaluated for their preliminary in vitro antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Nineteen compounds displayed obvious antibacterial potential, with special bactericidal activity against Gram positive bacteria, whereas, nine analogs showed moderate to weak antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The analog 12f proved to be the most active antimicrobial member identified in this study being comparable to ampicillin and gentamicin sulfate against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, together with a moderate antifungal activity. Additionally, nine derivatives were tested for their preliminary in vitro anticancer activity according to the current one-dose protocol of the NCI. Compound 9b revealed a broad spectrum of anticancer activity against 29 out of the tested 60 subpanel tumor cell lines. Collectively, compounds 4, 9b, 10b and 12f could be considered as promising dual anticancer antibiotics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",0
"Antimicrobial peptides have been widely identified from amphibian skins except salamanders. A novel antimicrobial peptide (CFBD) was isolated and characterized from skin secretions of the salamander, Cynops fudingensis. The cDNA encoding CFBD precursor was cloned from the skin cDNA library of C. fudingensis. The precursor was composed of three domains: signal peptide of 17 residues, mature peptide of 41 residues and intervening propeptide of 3 residues. There are six cysteines in the sequence of mature CFBD peptide, which possibly form three disulfide-bridges. CFBD showed antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Escherichia coli. This peptide could be classified into family of beta-defensin based on its seqeuence similarity with beta-defensins from other vertebrates. Evolution analysis indicated that CFBD was close to fish beta-defensin. As far as we know, CFBD is the first beta-defensin antimicrobial peptide from salamanders.",0
"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a versatile tool for visualizing molecular distributions in complex biological specimens, but locating microscopic chemical features of interest can be challenging in samples that lack a well-defined anatomy. To address this issue, we developed a correlated imaging approach that begins with performing matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI to obtain low-resolution molecular maps of a sample. The resulting maps are then used to direct subsequent microscopic secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments to examine selected chemical regions of interest. By employing MALDI undersampling, the sample surface is left mostly unperturbed and available for the SIMS analysis, while also generating an ablation array that can be used for navigation in SIMS. We validated this MALDI-guided SIMS approach using cultured biofilms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa; bioactive secondary metabolites, including rhamnolipids and quinolones, were detected and visualized on both macro- and microscopic size scales. MSI mass assignments were confirmed with in situ MALDI MS/MS and capillary electrophoresiselectrospray ionization MS/MS analysis of biofilm extracts. Two strains of P. aeruginosa were compared, wild type and a quorum sensing mutant, and differences in metabolite abundance and distribution were observed.",0
"The development of adjuvants for vaccines has become an important area of research as the number of protein-based vaccines against infectious pathogens increases. Currently, there are a number of adjuvant-based Mycobacterium tuberculosis vaccines in clinical trials that have shown efficacy in animal models. Despite these novel adjuvants, there is still a need to design new and more versatile adjuvants that have minimal adverse side effects but produce robust long-lasting adaptive immune responses. To this end, we hypothesized that Bacillus subtilis spores may provide the appropriate innate signals that are required to generate such vaccine-mediated responses, which would be sufficient to reduce the mycobacterial burden after infection with M. tuberculosis. In addition, we compared the response generated by B. subtilis spores to that generated by monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), which has been used extensively to test tuberculosis vaccines. The well-characterized, 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target of M. tuberculosis (ESAT-6; Rv3875) was used as a test antigen to determine the T cell activation potential of each adjuvant. Inoculated into mice, B. subtilis spores induced a strong proinflammatory response and Th1 immunity, similar to MPL; however, unlike MPL formulated with dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) bromide, it failed to induce significant levels of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and was unable to significantly reduce the mycobacterial burden after pulmonary infection with M. tuberculosis. Further analysis of the activity of MPL-DDA suggested that IL-17A was required for protective immunity. Taken together, the data emphasize the requirement for a network of cytokines that are essential for protective immunity.",0
"Antigonon leptopus ethanol extract yielded a known compound, quercetin-3-O-alpha-rhamnopyranoside and four novel anthraquinones named: 1,8-dihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methoxy-2-pyrrolidinium anthraquinone, 1,8-dihydroxy-6-(methyl)-3-methoxy-2-pyrrolidinium anthraquinone, 1,8-dihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)-3-methoxy-2-piperidinium anthraquinone, 1,8-dihydroxy-6-(methyl)-3-methoxy-2-piperidinium anthraquinone.

"Aflatoxins are major contaminants of wide range of food commodities which are susceptible to infection by Aspergillus, include cereals, oilseeds, spices and tree nuts. In the present study sixty eight lactic acid bacterial (LAB) cultures were isolated from fermented foods including idli batter, pickle, and fermented porridge (koozhu) and were screened for their ability to bind Aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)). HPLC were used to quantify the aflatoxin during binding studies. Out of the 68 isolates tested, 45 isolates exhibited their ability to bind AFB1 and 5 strains were able to bind more than 60% at 2,g/m1 concentration in Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) at pH 7. These five strains were Leuconostoc lactis (86.36%), Lactococcus lactis (78.7%), Bacillus subtilis (67.2%), Pediococcus pentosaceus (65.12%) and Weissella confuse (60.93%). This will help in the removal of AFB1 naturally from food and feed by using these strains as the starter culture for fermented food.",0
"Conjugation, or mating, plays a profound role in bacterial evolution by spreading genes that allow bacteria to adapt to and colonize new niches. ICEBs1, an integrative and conjugative element of Bacillus subtilis, can transfer itself and mobilize resident plasmids. DNA transfer is mediated by a type IV secretion system (T4SS). Characterized components of the ICEBs1 T4SS include the conserved VirB4-like ATPase ConE, the bifunctional cell wall hydrolase CwIT, and the presumed VirD4-like coupling protein ConQ. A fusion of ConE to green fluorescent protein (GFP) localizes to the membrane preferentially at the cell poles. One or more ICEBs1 proteins are required for ConE's localization at the membrane, as ConE lacks predicted transmembrane segments and ConE-GFP is found dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in cells lacking ICEBs1. Here, we analyzed five ICEBs1 genes to determine if they are required for DNA transfer and/or ConE-GFP localization. We found that conB, conC, conD, and conG, but not yddF, are required for both ICEBs1 transfer and plasmid mobilization. All four required genes encode predicted integral membrane proteins. conB and, to some extent, conD were required for localization of ConE-GFP to the membrane. Using an adenylate cyclase-based bacterial two-hybrid system, we found that ConE interacts with ConB. We propose a model in which the ICEBs1 conjugation machinery is composed of ConB, ConC, ConD, ConE, ConG, CwIT, ConQ, and possibly other ICEBs1 proteins, and that ConB interacts with ConE, helping to recruit and/or maintain ConE at the membrane. IMPORTANCE Conjugation is a major form of horizontal gene transfer and has played a profound role in bacterial evolution by moving genes, including those involved in antibiotic resistance, metabolism, symbiosis, and infectious disease. During conjugation, DNA is transferred from cell to cell through the conjugation machinery, a type of secretion system. Relatively little is known about the conjugation machinery of Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we analyzed five genes of the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1 of Bacillus subtilis. Our research identifies four new components of the ICEBs1 conjugation machinery (ConB, ConC, ConD, and ConG) and shows an interaction between ConB and ConE that is required for ConE to associate with the cell membrane.",0
"This study reveals the beneficial synergistic phytoremediation potential of Petunia grandiflora Juss. with its rhizospheric bacterial isolate Bacillus pumilus strain PgJ to decolorize reactive Navy Blue RX (NBRX) dye by their active enzymatic machinery. In vitro cultures of P. grandiflora and B. pumilus gave 80.01% and 76.80% while their consortium decolorized NBRX up to 96.86% within 36 h. Significant induction in the enzyme activities of lignin peroxidase (207%), tyrosinase (133%), laccase (161%), riboflavin reductase (78%) were seen in the roots of tissue cultured plants while enzymes tyrosinase (660%), laccase (689%), riboflavin reductase (528%) were induced significantly in the B. pumilus cells. Metabolites of treated NBRX were analyzed using UV-vis spectroscopy, gas chromatography and biotransformation was visualized using high performance thin layer chromatography profile. Metabolites of the dye exhibited reduced phytotoxicity Sorghum vulgare and Phaeseolus mungo and significant reduction in cytogenotoxicity on Allium cepa roots when compared to NBRX.

"Thirty-one medicinal plants of 24 families, used by the indigenous people of Bangladesh for health care, were screened and bio-prospected for their antibacterial activity against eight pathogenic bacteria ( Bacillus subtilis, B. megaterium, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysenteriae) using disc diffusion and agar cup assays. Twenty six plants showed positive antibacterial efficacy with Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia chebula, Justicia adhatoda, Ocimin sanctum, Solanum torvum and Flemingia stricta depicting the most significant zone of inhibition. Maximum zone of inhibition (21 mm) was recorded against V. cholera with the fruit extracts of Solanum torvum. The present study supports the traditional uses of medicinal plant by the indigenous communities for treating microbial infections and could constitute a potential source for the discovery of new antibiotics.",0
"This experiment was carried out to investigate the potential probiotics properties of Bacillus subtilis in protecting of juvenile freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii against Aeromonas hydrophila infection. A B. subtilis bacterium isolated from gut of juvenile prawns was added to the prawns feed at 10(8) cells g(-1) feed. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) between B. subtilis-treated and control groups in growth and survival enhancement of juvenile prawns after 60 days of feeding trial. Sixty days after B. subtilis feeding trial, the prawns were challenged by bath exposure to A. hydrophila (10(7) cells mL(-1)) for 28 days. Four weeks after challenge, there was significant difference in the survival of prawns between B. subtilis-treated groups (88.33 %) and control groups (20.81 %; P < 0.05). In addition, the control groups had an unhealthy external appearance, while the treated groups, appeared healthy and normal. From this, it was concluded that the selected B. subtilis may be a promising probiotics for protection of prawns from A. hydrophila infection.",0
"Desert false indigo (Amorpha fruticosa L.) is an invasive alien shrub, native to Southwest and North America, naturalized in Europe as an ornamental shrub species forming mono-dominant communities by replacing Salix triandra. A. fruticosa leaves extract was obtained by ultrasound-assisted method and the chemical composition was identified through Folin-Ciocalteu method for determining the phenolic content and aluminium trichloride method for the flavonoids content. The phytotoxicity bioassay was intended to demonstrate a specific traits of invasive plants, namely their ability to remove agricultural interest species by determining the effect of this extracts on root elongation and the mitotic film cell by Triticum assay. The antimicrobial activity was investigated by disk diffusion and microdillution method against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and yeast strains. The minimal inhibitory concentration varied from 0.09 to 0.66 % of the dried plant. This study demonstrated the phytotoxic ability of A. fruticosa invasive species revealed by changes induced to cell division but also their potential beneficial effects through their use as a therapeutic agent in antibiotherapy.",0
"In this study, a combination route of the solvent volatilization-in situ cross-linking method and ascorbic acid in situ reduction method was developed to fabricate conjugated linolenic acid polymer dressings impregnated silver nano-crystals (CLn/Ag dressings). Scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, Energy Dispersive X-ray and atomic absorption spectroscopy provided a qualitative and quantitative support to the formation of silver nano-crystals on the hill-structured conjugated linolenic acid polymer dressings. The size of hill-shaped structure and silver nano-crystals, and the loading efficiency of silver could be controlled by adjusting the ratio of conjugated linolenic acid to silver source. The cells viability analysis and morphological evidences displayed that the inhibition of CLn/Ag dressings on PC 12 tumor cells were closely related with the conjugated linolenic acid polymers rather than silver nano-crystals. The highest inhibition ratio got to 82.3 %. The antibacterial activity towards Bacillus subtilis and Staphyloccocus aureus was investigated for different CLn/Ag dressings by using disc diffusion method. The results revealed that the dressings had significant bactericidal effect on both bacteria in a silver loading efficiency-dependent mode. This research supports the potential value of CLn/Ag dressings as coating for tissue engineering substitutes to simultaneously inhibit hamartoplasia and bacterial infection during operation.

"Novel chalcone based 6-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one and 2H-indazol-3-ol derivatives were synthesized and characterized by using spectral techniques like IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, COSY, DEPT, and GC-MS. All these compounds were screened for anti-fungal, anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant activity. Cyclohexenone derivatives, in general, showed better anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activity than parent chalcones. Whereas, all the Indazole derivatives showed very good anti-oxidant activity and some were also found to be active as anti-bacterial agent. Among the screened compounds, 15 was found to be most active as anti-fungal agent (against Rhizoctonia solani, LC50 = 2.36 mu g mL(-1)), 15b was found to be most active anti-bacterial agent (against Klebsiella pneumonia, MIC = 24.68 mu g mL(-1)) and 14b emerged as most active anti-oxidant (IC50 = 19.81 mu g mL(-1)).

"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the active ingredient of household bleach, is the most common disinfectant in medical, industrial, and domestic use and plays an important role in microbial killing in the innate immune system. Given the critical importance of the antimicrobial properties of chlorine to public health, it is surprising how little is known about the ways in which bacteria sense and respond to reactive chlorine species (RCS). Although the literature on bacterial responses to reactive oxygen species (ROS) is enormous, work addressing bacterial responses to RCS has begun only recently. Transcriptomic and proteomic studies now provide new insights into how bacteria mount defenses against this important class of antimicrobial compounds. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge, emphasizing the overlaps between RCS stress responses and other more well-characterized bacterial defense systems, and identify outstanding questions that represent productive avenues for future research.",0
"Background: The completion of whole-genome sequencing for Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis strain 1002 has contributed to major advances in research aimed at understanding the biology of this microorganism. This bacterium causes significant loss to goat and sheep farmers because it is the causal agent of the infectious disease caseous lymphadenitis, which may lead to outcomes ranging from skin injury to animal death. In the current study, we simulated the conditions experienced by the bacteria during host infection. By sequencing transcripts using the SOLiD (TM) 3 Plus platform, we identified new targets expected to potentiate the survival and replication of the pathogen in adverse environments. These results may also identify possible candidates useful for the development of vaccines, diagnostic kits or therapies aimed at the reduction of losses in agribusiness. Results: Under the 3 simulated conditions (acid, osmotic and thermal shock stresses), 474 differentially expressed genes exhibiting at least a 2-fold change in expression levels were identified. Important genes to the infection process were induced, such as those involved in virulence, defence against oxidative stress, adhesion and regulation, and many genes encoded hypothetical proteins, indicating that further investigation of the bacterium is necessary. The data will contribute to a better understanding of the biology of C. pseudotuberculosis and to studies investigating strategies to control the disease. Conclusions: Despite the veterinary importance of C. pseudotuberculosis, the bacterium is poorly characterised; therefore, effective treatments for caseous lymphadenitis have been difficult to establish. Through the use of RNAseq, these results provide a better biological understanding of this bacterium, shed light on the most likely survival mechanisms used by this microorganism in adverse environments and identify candidates that may help reduce or even eradicate the problems caused by this disease.",0
"A highly convenient method has been developed for the synthesis of (prop-2-ynyloxy) benzene and its derivatives. Differently substituted phenol and aniline derivatives were allowed to react with propargyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 base and acetone as solvent. The compounds were synthesized in good yields (53-85%). Low cost, high yields and easy availability of compounds helped in the synthesis. Electron withdrawing groups favor the formation of stable phenoxide ion thus in turn favors the formation of product while electron donating groups do not favor the reaction. Phenol derivatives gave good yields as compared to that of aniline. As aprotic polar solvents favor S(N)2 type reactions so acetone provided best solvation for the reactions. K2CO3 was proved to be good for the synthesis. Antibacterial, Antiurease and NO scavenging activity of synthesized compounds were also examined. 4-bromo-2-chloro-1-(prop-2-ynyloxy) benzene 2a was found most active compound against urease enzyme with a percentage inhibition of 82.00 +/- 0.09 at 100 mu g/mL with IC50 value of 60.2. 2-bromo-4-methyl-1-(prop-2-ynyloxy)benzene 2d was found potent antibacterial against Bacillus subtillus showing excellent inhibitory action with percentage inhibition of 55.67 +/- 0.26 at 100 mu g/ml wih IC50 value of 79.9. Based on results, it can be concluded that some of the synthesized compounds may have potential antiurease and antibacterial effects against several harmful substances.",0
"A series of novel benzimidazole quinolones as potential antimicrobial agents were designed and synthesized. Most of the prepared compounds exhibited good or even stronger antimicrobial activities in comparison with reference drugs. The most potent compound 15m was membrane active and did not trigger the development of resistance in bacteria. It not only inhibited the formation of biofilms but also disrupted the established Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli biofilms. It was able to inhibit the relaxation activity of E. coli topoisomerase IV at 10 mu M concentration. Moreover, this compound also showed low toxicity against mammalian cells. Molecular modeling and experimental investigation of compound 15m with DNA suggested that this compound could effectively bind with DNA to form a steady 15m-DNA complex which might further block DNA replication to exert the powerful bioactivities.

"Four chromium-resistant bacterial strains (Bacillus pumilus-CrK08, Cellulosimicrobium cellulansCrK16, Exiguobacterium-CrK19, and Bacillus cereus-CrK20) that could resist up to 25 mg.ml(-1) of Cr (VI) were used to inoculate Zea mays (Lin) seeds grown in tannery effluent-contaminated and normal garden soils. Overall, plants growing in tannery-contaminated soil showed slow leaf growth, 40% reduction in shoot length, 73% reduction in dry biomass, burning of leaf margins, delayed flower bud initiation, and feminization of male flowers compared to control. Zea mays (Lin) plants growing in tannery-contaminated soil showed an increase in acid phosphatase activity (14-26%), soluble proteins content (17-38%), chlorophyll a (34%) and b contents (70%), and a decrease in peroxidase (19%) and carotenoid contents (50%) compared to control. Non-inoculated plants have higher chromium uptake (114 mg/kg) as compared to inoculated (49.4 mg/kg).",0
"Alcaligenes sp. HPC 1271 demonstrated antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, Enterobacter sp., resistant to sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, azithromycin, and tetracycline, as well as against Serratia sp. GMX1, resistant to the same antibiotics with the addition of netilmicin. The cell-free culture supernatant was analyzed for possible anti-bacterials by HPLC, and the active fraction was further identified by LC-MS. Results suggest the production of tunicamycin, a nucleoside antibiotic. The draft genome of this bacterial isolate was analyzed, and the 4.2 Mb sequence data revealed six secondary metabolite-producing clusters, identified using antiSMASH platform as ectoine, butyrolactone, phosphonate, terpene, polyketides, and nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS). Additionally, the draft genome demonstrated homology to the tunicamycin-producing gene cluster and also defined 30 ORFs linked to protein secretion that could also play a role in the antibacterial activity observed. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that both NRPS and dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase gene clusters are functional and could be involved in antibacterial biosynthesis.",0
"New series of thiourea derivatives incorporating a hippuric acid moiety have been synthesized through the reaction of 4-hippuric acid isothiocyanate with various nitrogen nucleophiles such as aliphatic amines, aromatic amines, sulfa drugs, aminopyrazoles, phenylhydrazine and hydrazides.

"Pink Root is among the major diseases of onion and its causal agent, Setophoma terrestris, is one of the most severe pathogens in soils of tropical and subtropical climates. The management of Pink Root is difficult and the strategies currently used are ineffective. Although, there are some varieties resistant to S. terrestris, they are not resistant to every isolate of the pathogen and it is not unusual to find isolates that break that resistance. Moreover, chemical control is not technically or economically feasible. So, we decided to address biocontrol as a mean to manage the main onion disease in Argentina. We tested the efficiency of a strain of Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis isolated from the rhizosphere of onion plants to inhibit the growth of S. terrestris in vitro. Our strain of Bacillus subtilis showed a strong capacity of growth inhibition of S. terrestris. No antagonistic activity against two other onion pathogens, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae and F. proliferatum, was observed. Interestingly, we found a high growth inhibition of S. terrestris on plates containing cell-free supernatant of B. subtilis previously grown in the presence of the fungus. No significant differences in the fungal growth were obtained between control plates and plates containing cell-free supernatant from B. subtilis grown without previous contact with S. terrestris. Electron microscopy of S. terrestris from co-cultures plates revealed thickened, tortuous or coiled fungal hyphae, with granules and globular like terminations. These results suggested that the strain of B. subtilis under study has a strong biocontrol activity against S. terrestris and that it would be acting diffusible bacterial inhibitory compounds specifically induced by this pathogen.",0
"The iron-dependent regulator (IdeR) is a metal ion-activated transcriptional repressor that regulates the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake to maintain metal-ion homeostasis. IdeR is a functional homologue of the diphtheria toxin repressor (DtxR), and both belong to the DtxR/MntR family of metalloregulators. The structure of Fe2+-bound IdeR (TA0872) from Themoplasma acidophilum was determined at 2.1 angstrom resolution by X-ray crystallography using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction. The presence of Fe2+, which is the true biological activator of IdeR, in the metal-binding site was ascertained by the use of anomalous difference electron-density maps using diffraction data collected at the Fe absorption edge. Each DtxR/IdeR subunit contains two metal ion-binding sites separated by 9 angstrom, labelled the primary and ancillary sites, whereas the crystal structures of IdeR from T. acidophilum show a binuclear iron cluster separated by 3.2 angstrom, which is novel to T. acidophilum IdeR. The metal-binding site analogous to the primary site in DtxR was unoccupied, and the ancillary site was occupied by binuclear clustered ions. This difference suggests that T. acidophilum IdeR and its closely related homologues are regulated by a mechanism distinct from that of either DtxR or MntR. T. acidophilum IdeR was also shown to have a metal-dependent DNA-binding property by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.",0
"The important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) produces a hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule that plays critical roles in immune evasion. Previous studies showed that the hasABC operon encoding the capsule biosynthesis enzymes is under the control of a single promoter, P1, which is negatively regulated by the two-component regulatory system CovR/S. In this work, we characterize the sequence upstream of P1 and identify a novel regulatory region controlling transcription of the capsule biosynthesis operon in the M1 serotype strain MGAS2221. This region consists of a promoter, P2, which initiates transcription of a novel small RNA, HasS, an intrinsic transcriptional terminator that inefficiently terminates HasS, permitting read-through transcription of hasABC, and a putative promoter which lies upstream of P2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and transcriptional reporter data identified CovR as a negative regulator of P2. We found that the P1 and P2 promoters are completely repressed by CovR, and capsule expression is regulated by the putative promoter upstream of P2. Deletion of hasS or of the terminator eliminates CovR-binding sequences, relieving repression and increasing read-through, hasA transcription, and capsule production. Sequence analysis of 44 GAS genomes revealed a high level of polymorphism in the HasS sequence region. Most of the HasS variations were located in the terminator sequences, suggesting that this region is under strong selective pressure. We discovered that the terminator deletion mutant is highly resistant to neutrophil-mediated killing and is significantly more virulent in a mouse model of GAS invasive disease than the wild-type strain. Together, these results are consistent with the naturally occurring mutations in this region modulating GAS virulence.",0
"Objective: To examine hypoglycemic and antibacterial activity against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of organic extracts of four Bangladeshi plants.Methods: An in vivo hypoglycemic effect on mice model was used to check the hypoglycemic effect of four Bangladeshi herbal organic extracts viz., roots of Curculigo recurvata W. T. Aiton (Satipata) (C. recurvata), leaf of Amorphophallus bulbifer Roxb. (Olkachu) (A. bulbifer), whole plant of Thunbergia grandiflora Roxb. (Nillata) (T. grandiflora) and leaf of Steudnera colocasiifolia K. Koch (Yunnan) (S. colocasiifolia) using glibenclamide as a positive control and water as a negative control. They were also tested for antibacterial activity on three Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria by disk diffusion method. C. recurvata, A. bulbifer and T. grandiflora were extracted with methanol and S. colocasiifolia was extracted with ethanol.Results: Among all the plant extract, only ethanol extract of S. colocasiifolia leaves at 800 mg/kg dose significantly (P < 0.01) reduced fasting glucose level in normal mice as compared to standard drug glibenclamide (5 mg/kg). Ethanol extract of S. colocasiifolia leaves at 800 mg/kg dose decreased 20.28% of blood glucose level after 2 h of administration in normal mice, where glibenclamide decreased 39.63%. Methanol extract of T. grandiflora didn't show any zone of inhibition against the tested bacteria, but other three extracts showed a wide range of zone of inhibition. However, none of the extract showed antibacterial activity against all the tested bacteria. Methanol extract of C. recurvata showed maximum zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus [(10.50 +/- 0.50) mm], Salmonella typhi [(16.20 +/- 1.26) mm], Escherichia coli [(13.00 +/- 1.00) mm] and ethanol extract of S. colocasiifolia showed maximum zone of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus [(11.20 +/- 1.26 (mm)], Bacillus subtilis [(12.00 +/- 0.50 (mm)], Salmonella paratyphi [(10.80 +/- 0.29 (mm)]. Only methanol extract of A. bulbifer showed (8.50 +/- 0.50) mm and (7.20 +/- 0.76) mm zone of inhibition against Pseudomomas aeruginosa at 1 000 and 800 mu g/disk dose respectively.Conclusions: Through our study, it was found that S. colocasiifolia could be considered as very promising and beneficial hypoglycemic agent. Although C. recurvata and S. colocasiifolia showed comparable high antibacterial activity, further studies should be needed to develop new antibacterial agent from them. S. colocasiifolia may be a potential source for the development of new oral hypoglycemic agent.",0
"To understand the growth-promoting and disease-inhibiting activities of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains, the genomes of 12 Bacillus subtilis group strains with PGPR activity were sequenced and analyzed. These B. subtilis strains exhibited high genomic diversity, whereas the genomes of B. amyloliquefaciens strains (a member of the B. subtilis group) are highly conserved. A pairwise BLASTp matrix revealed that gene family similarity among Bacillus genomes ranges from 32 to 90%, with 2839 genes within the core genome of B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum. Comparative genomic analyses of B. amyloliquefaciens strains identified genes that are linked with biological control and colonization of roots and/or leaves, including 73 genes uniquely associated with subsp. plantarum strains that have predicted functions related to signaling, transportation, secondary metabolite production, and carbon source utilization. Although B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strains contain gene clusters that encode many different secondary metabolites, only polyketide biosynthetic clusters that encode difficidin and macrolactin are conserved within this subspecies. To evaluate their role in plant pathogen biocontrol, genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis were deleted in a B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strain, revealing that difficidin expression is critical in reducing the severity of disease, caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria in tomato plants. This study defines genomic features of PGPR strains and links them with biocontrol activity and with host colonization.",1
"The bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens anti-CA isolated from mangrove system was found to be able to actively kill Candida albicans isolated from clinic. The bacterial strain anti-CA could produce high level of bioactive substance, amylase and protease in the cheap medium containing 2.0 % soybean meal, 2.0 % wheat flour, pH 6.5 within 26 h. After purification, the main bioactive substance was confirmed to be a cyclic lipopeptide containing a heptapeptide, L-Asp -> L-Leu -> L-Leu -> L-Val -> L-Val -> L-Glu -> L-Leu and a 3-OH fatty acid (15 carbons). In addition to C. albicans, the purified lipopeptide can also kill many yeast strains including Metschnikowia bicuspidata, Candida tropicalis, Yarrowia lipolytica and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After treated by the purified lipopeptide, both the whole cells and protoplasts of C. albicans were destroyed.",0
"Purpose: E. coli is a gram-negative bacterium. Outbreaks of the enterohemorrhagic E. coli strain (EHEC) have caused dangerous pandemics and dozens of deaths. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin cell wall of gram-negative bacteria is an important cause of septic shock. The aim of this study was to design an innovative genetic construct model whose expression prevents gram-negative bacteria growth and infection. Noninfectious gram-positive bacteria B. subtilis were modified with a constitutive secretory gene construct to secrete Limulus polyphemus anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (LALF), which binds and neutralizes the LPS layer found in E. coli cell wall. Methods: LALF gene construct was designed by using the Gibson assembly synthetic biology cloning method for the purpose of synthesis and secretion of the protein in B. subtilis. The synthesis and secretion of LALF protein was optimized with constitutive promoter, ribosome binding site and secretory signal peptide specific for B. subtilis gene expression system. Results: In the zones on LB-agar growth plate where LALF protein-secreting B. subtilis supernatant had been added, growth of red fluorescent protein (RFP) expressing E. coli was inhibited. There was no E. coli colony on the zones where LALF secreted B. subtilis biofilm has been added. Conclusion: LALF inhibits the growth of gram-negative bacteria. LALF may prove to be useful for the treatment of diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria. This study presents not only an alternative sterilization method for hospitals and laboratories but also an effective clearance treatment for bacteria that cause diseases such as septic shock.",0
"One new isochromane (pseudoanguillosporin C, 2), seven isochromanones (soudanones A-G, 3-9), and six known analogues including 10 and 11 were isolated from a culture of the fungus Cadophora sp. 10-5-2 M, collected from the subterranean 10th level of the Soudan Underground Iron Mine in Minnesota. All of the compounds were tested against a panel of microbial pathogens, and 2, 3, 10, and 11 were found to have activity against Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC = 35, 40, 20, and 30 mu g/mL, respectively). Compound 11 was also active against Candida albicans, with an MIC of 40 mu g/mL.",0
"The eggs of black widow spider (L. tredecimguttatus) have been demonstrated to be rich in toxic proteinaceous components. The study on such active components is of theoretical and practical importance. In the present work, using a combination of multiple biochemical and biological strategies, we isolated and characterized the proteinaceous components from the aqueous extract of the black widow spider eggs. After gel filtration of the egg extract, the resulting main protein and peptide peaks were further fractionated by ion exchange chromatography and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Two proteinaceous components, named latroeggtoxin-III and latroeggtoxin-IV, respectively, were purified to homogeneity. Latroeggtoxin-III was demonstrated to have a molecular weight of about 36 kDa. Activity analysis indicated that latroeggtoxin-III exhibited neurotoxicity against cockroaches but had no obvious effect on mice, suggesting that it is an insect-specific toxin. Latroeggtoxin-IV, with a molecular weight of 3.6 kDa, was shown to be a broad-spectrum antibacterial peptide, showing inhibitory activity against all five species of bacteria tested, with the highest activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Finally, the implications of the proteinaceous toxins in egg protection and their potential applications were analyzed and discussed.",0
"Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) causing anthracnose is a potent pathogen of chilli resulting in significant yield loss. The in vitro root colonisation study showed an increase in root bacterial count by 10 x 105 colony forming units/cm root for Bacillus subtilis after 15 days of germination. Population level of the antagonist was stable in talc till the 180th day (30 degrees C - 1.6 x 108; 4 degrees C - 1.9 x 10(8)) and in lignite till the 150th day (30 degrees C - 1.5 x 10(8); 4 degrees C - 1.3 x 10(8)). Combined application of B. subtilis and carbendazim enhanced all biometric parameters with reduction in disease incidence. Soil, seed, root dip and foliar spray treatment significantly enhanced the growth parameters of chilli in B. subtilis inoculated treatments in comparison to the untreated control. Seed application resulted in highest plant fresh weight (76.84 g) and dry weight (34.17 g) compared to the untreated control (50 g and 21 g fresh and dry weight, respectively). Highest plant height ranging from 70 cm (soil application) to 77 cm (dip treatment) with Bacillus inoculation was comparable with carbendazim treatment (61 cm with soil application) and 78 cm (dip treatment) and significantly higher than the untreated control (58.2 cm with soil and 61 cm with application, respectively). Dip treatment resulted in significant increase in root length with B. subtilis (33 cm) and carbendazim (32.5 cm) in comparison to untreated control (15 cm). Co-inoculation of pathogen with B. subtilis (singly and with carbendazim) not only reduced the disease incidence but also improved all the biometric parameters in comparison to challenge inoculation. Root dip application was effective in promoting growth while seed application was effective in disease control.",0
"The structural similarity between defensins and scorpion neurotoxins suggests that they might have evolved from a common ancestor. However, there is no direct experimental evidence demonstrating a functional link between scorpion neurotoxins and defensins. The scorpion defensin BmKDfsin4 from Mesobuthus martensii Karsch contains 37 amino acid residues and a conserved cystine-stabilized / structural fold. The recombinant BmKDfsin4, a classical defensin, has been found to have inhibitory activity against Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Micrococcus luteus as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Interestingly, electrophysiological experiments showed that BmKDfsin4,like scorpion potassium channel neurotoxins, could effectively inhibit Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 channel currents, and its IC50 value for the Kv1.3 channel was 510.2 nm. Similar to the structure-function relationships of classical scorpion potassium channel-blocking toxins, basic residues (Lys-13 and Arg-19) of BmKDfsin4 play critical roles in peptide-Kv1.3 channel interactions. Furthermore, mutagenesis and electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that the channel extracellular pore region is the binding site of BmKDfsin4, indicating that BmKDfsin4adopts the same mechanism for blocking potassium channel currents as classical scorpion toxins. Taken together, our work identifies scorpion BmKDfsin4 as the first invertebrate defensin to block potassium channels. These findings not only demonstrate that defensins from invertebrate animals are a novel type of potassium channel blockers but also provide evidence of a functional link between defensins and neurotoxins.",0
"A new series of fluoro 1,2,3-triazole tagged amino bis (benzothiazole) derivatives 8, 9 were prepared starting from 2-amino benzothiazole in four steps via amination, cyclization, alkylation followed by reaction with various azides under sharpless conditions through click chemistry approach. All newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity against four human cancer cell lines (U937, THP-1, Colo205, and A549), and promising compounds have been identified.",0
"Research on tuberculosis and leprosy was revolutionized by the development of a plasmid transformation system in the fast-growing surrogate, Mycobacterium smegmatis. This transformation system was made possible by the successful isolation of a M. smegmatis mutant strain mc(2)155, whose efficient plasmid transformation (ept) phenotype supported the replication of Mycobacterium fortuitum pAL5000 plasmids. In this report, we identified the EptC gene, the loss of which confers the ept phenotype. EptC shares significant amino acid sequence homology and domain structure with the MukB protein of Escherichia coli, a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein. Surprisingly, M. smegmatis has three paralogs of SMC proteins: EptC and MSMEG_0370 both share homology with Gram-negative bacterial MukB; and MSMEG_2423 shares homology with Gram-positive bacterial SMCs, including the single SMC protein predicted for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. Purified EptC was shown to bind ssDNA and stabilize negative super-coils in plasmid DNA. Moreover, an EptC-mCherry fusion protein was constructed and shown to bind to DNA in live mycobacteria, and to prevent segregation of plasmid DNA to daughter cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of impaired plasmid maintenance caused by a SMC homolog, which has been canonically known to assist the segregation of genetic materials.",0
"ESX-3 is one of the five type VII secretion systems encoded by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome. We recently showed the essentiality of ESX-3 for M. tuberculosis viability and proposed its involvement in iron and zinc metabolism. In this study we confirmed the role of ESX-3 in iron uptake and its involvement in the adaptation to low zinc environment in M. tuberculosis. Moreover, we unveiled functional differences between the ESX-3 roles in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis showing that in the latter ESX-3 is only involved in the adaptation to iron and not to zinc restriction. Finally, we also showed that in M. tuberculosis this secretion system is essential for iron and zinc homeostasis not only in conditions in which the concentrations of these metals are limiting but also in metal sufficient conditions.",0
"Streptococcus pneumoniae is an oval-shaped Gram-positive coccus that lives in intimate association with its human host, both as a commensal and pathogen. The seriousness of pneumococcal infections and the spread of multi-drug resistant strains call for new lines of intervention. Bacterial cell division is an attractive target to develop antimicrobial drugs. This review discusses the recent advances in understanding S.pneumoniae growth and division, in comparison with the best studied rod-shaped models, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. To maintain their shape, these bacteria propagate by peripheral and septal peptidoglycan synthesis, involving proteins that assemble into distinct complexes called the elongasome and the divisome, respectively. Many of these proteins are conserved in S.pneumoniae, supporting the notion that the ovococcal shape is also achieved by rounds of elongation and division. Importantly, S.pneumoniae and close relatives with similar morphology differ in several aspects from the model rods. Overall, the data support a model in which a single large machinery, containing both the peripheral and septal peptidoglycan synthesis complexes, assembles at midcell and governs growth and division. The mechanisms generating the ovococcal or coccal shape in lactic-acid bacteria have likely evolved by gene reduction from a rod-shaped ancestor of the same group.",0
"Airborne biological particles containing viruses, bacteria, and/or fungi can be toxic and cause infections and allergy symptoms. Recently, natural materials such as tea tree oil and Sophora flavescens have shown promising antimicrobial activity when applied as air filter media. Although many of these studies demonstrated excellent antimicrobial efficacy, only a few of them considered external environmental effects such as the surrounding humidity, temperature, and natural degradation of chemicals, all of which can affect the antimicrobial performance of these natural materials. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial durability of air filters containing airborne nanoparticles from S. flavescens for 5 months. Antimicrobial tests and quantitative chemical analyses were performed every 30 days. Morphological changes in the nanoparticles were also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. The major antimicrobial compounds remained stable and active for similar to 90 days at room temperature. After about 90 days, the quantities of major antimicrobial compounds decreased noticeably with a consequent decrease in antimicrobial activity. These results are promising for the implementation of new technologies using natural antimicrobial products and provide useful information regarding the average life expectancy of antimicrobial filters using nanoparticles of S. flavescens.

"Bacillus subtilis as an important workhorse that has been widely used to produce enzymes and metabolites. To broaden its applications, especially in the food and feed industry, we constructed a novel, stable, food-grade expression system by engineering its type II toxin-antitoxin system. The expression of the toxin EndoA, encoded by the chromosomal ydcE gene, was regulated by an endogenous, xylose-inducible promoter, while the ydcD gene, which encodes the unstable antitoxin EndoB, was inserted into a food-grade vector backbone, where its expression was driven by the native, constitutive promoter PylxM . By maintaining the xylose concentration above 2.0 g L -1, this auto-regulated expression system was absolutely stable after 100 generations. Compared with traditional antibiotic-dependent expression systems, this novel expression system resulted in greater biomass and higher titers of desired products (enzymes or metabolites). Our results demonstrate that this stable, food-grade expression system is suitable for enzyme production and pathway engineering, especially for the production of food-grade enzymes and metabolites.

"Desiccation tolerance contributes to the maintenance of bacterial populations in hospital settings and may partly explain its propensity to cause outbreaks. Identification and relative quantitation of proteins involved in bacterial desiccation tolerance was made using label-free quantitation and iTRAQ labeling. Under desiccating conditions, the population of the Acinetobacter baumannii clinical strain AbH12O-A2 decreased in the first week, and thereafter, a stable population of 0.5% of the original population was maintained. Using label-free quantitation and iTRAQ labeling, 727 and 765 proteins, respectively, were detected; 584 of them by both methods. Proteins overexpressed under desiccation included membrane and periplasmic proteins. Proteins associated with antimicrobial resistance, efflux pumps, and quorum quenching were overexpressed in the samples subjected to desiccation stress. Electron microscopy revealed clear morphological differences between desiccated and control bacteria. We conclude that A. baumannii is able to survive long periods of desiccation through the presence of cells in a dormant state, via mechanisms affecting control of cell cycling, DNA coiling, transcriptional and translational regulation, protein stabilization, antimicrobial resistance, and toxin synthesis, and that a few surviving cells embedded in a biofilm matrix are able to resume growth and restore the original population in appropriate environmental conditions following a ""bust-and-boom"" strategy.",0
"Background: Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of hospital-borne infections occurring when the natural intestinal flora is depleted following antibiotic treatment. Current treatments for Clostridium difficile infections present high relapse rates and new hyper-virulent and multi-resistant strains are emerging, making the study of this nosocomial pathogen necessary to find novel therapeutic targets. Results: We present iMLTC806cdf, an extensively curated reconstructed metabolic network for the C. difficile pathogenic strain 630. iMLTC806cdf contains 806 genes, 703 metabolites and 769 metabolic, 117 exchange and 145 transport reactions. iMLTC806cdf is the most complete and accurate metabolic reconstruction of a gram-positive anaerobic bacteria to date. We validate the model with simulated growth assays in different media and carbon sources and use it to predict essential genes. We obtain 89.2% accuracy in the prediction of gene essentiality when compared to experimental data for B. subtilis homologs (the closest organism for which such data exists). We predict the existence of 76 essential genes and 39 essential gene pairs, a number of which are unique to C. difficile and have non-existing or predicted non-essential human homologs. For 29 of these potential therapeutic targets, we find 125 inhibitors of homologous proteins including approved drugs with the potential for drug repositioning, that when validated experimentally could serve as starting points in the development of new antibiotics. Conclusions: We created a highly curated metabolic network model of C. difficile strain 630 and used it to predict essential genes as potential new therapeutic targets in the fight against Clostridium difficile infections.",0
"Background: In recent decades, biological properties of biosurfactants, particularly glycolipids, including antimicrobial, antifungal, and anti-cellular effects have been projected in many research studies. The unique advantages of these compounds in terms of production and environment made them important as antimicrobial agents. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate probable antibacterial and antifungal properties of MR01 and MASH1 biosurfactants against several specified microorganisms. Materials and Methods: In this article antibacterial activities of two rhamnolipid mixtures of MR01 and MASH1 were studied. MR01 and MASH1 are glycolipid-type biosurfactants that are being produced by two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MR01 and MASH1, respectively. Antibacterial effects of two biosurfactants were assessed by disc diffusion test method and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: They exhibit not only excellent surface activity but also remarkable inhibitory effect against Gram-positive bacteria. According to results, although none of two biosurfactants showed significant effects on Gram negative bacteria growth inhibition, both assessing methods confirmed the growth inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria by MR01 and MASH1 biosurfactants. Conclusions: According to results of this study, MR01 and MASH1 biosurfactants had antimicrobial efficacy against Gram positive bacterial groups. This effect is comparable to antibiotics and therefore the future use of these biosurfactants as broad spectrum antibiotics is highly promising. These features of biosurfactants (BS) should broaden its applications in new advanced technologies. Future studies will be performed on characterization and isolation of biologically active fraction of the rhamnolipid biosurfactant produced by P. aeruginosa strains. This bioactive compound may be evaluated as a potent antimicrobial agent to be applied against a panel of pathogenic micro-organisms including a few multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical pathogenic isolates such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other MDR pathogenic strains.

"A concise and practical synthetic study towards racemic Ieodomycin A was described, which started from commercially available 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol (geraniol) and proceeded through a key Mukaiyama aldol reaction. Marine microorganisms has proved to be a rich source of new biologically active secondary metabolites including antitumor, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral compound.([1]) Since several pathogens are developing a resistance to antibiotics, there is an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents to combat the threats imposed by antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria.([2]) A diene compound Ieodomycin A-D (as showed in Scheme 1) have been isolated by Shin et al from the marine bacterial Bacillus species([3]), which have shown potent antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 32-64 mu g/mL. Due to the favorable bioactivity, however, the scarce availability from the natural source, the Ieodomycins have been attractive synthetic targets since they were isolated. Koul([4]) reported the first total synthesis of Ieodomycin A and B started from D-glucose in 15 steps. Then, Reddy([5]) published their stereoselective total synthesis of Ieodomycins A and B started from geraniol in 11 steps. Recently, Meshram reported a novel total synthesis of Ieodomycin A and B via a Evans Aldol strategy([6]).",0
"Rex factors are bacterial transcription factors thought to respond to the cellular NAD(+)/NADH ratio in order to modulate gene expression by differentially binding DNA. To date, Rex factors have been implicated in regulating genes of central metabolism, oxidative stress response, and biofilm formation. The genome of Enterococcus faecalis, a low-GC Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen, encodes EF2638, a putative Rex factor. To study the role of E. faecalis Rex, we purified EF2638 and evaluated its DNA binding activity in vitro. EF2638 was able to bind putative promoter segments of several E. faecalis genes in an NADH-responsive manner, indicating that it represents an authentic Rex factor. Transcriptome analysis of a Delta EF2638 mutant revealed that genes likely to be involved in anaerobic metabolism were upregulated during aerobic growth, and the mutant exhibited an altered NAD(+)/NADH ratio. The Delta EF2638 mutant also exhibited a growth defect when grown with aeration on several carbon sources, suggesting an impaired ability to cope with oxidative stress. Inclusion of catalase in the medium alleviated the growth defect. H2O2 measurements revealed that the mutant accumulates significantly more H2O2 than wild-type E. faecalis. In summary, EF2638 represents an authentic Rex factor in E. faecalis that influences the production or detoxification of H2O2 in addition to its more familiar role as a regulator of anaerobic gene expression.",0
"To obtain basic information on how microbial cells absorb cadmium from aqueous solution, we examined cadmium absorption in various micro-organisms. Of 51 micro-organism strains tested, we found that some Gram-positive bacteria, such as, Arthrobacter nicotianae and Bacillus subtilis, and some actinomycetes, such as, Streptomyces flavoviridis and S. levoris were highly capable of absorbing cadmium from an aqueous solution. A. nicotianae absorbed the largest amount of cadmium, over 800 mu mol cadmium per gram of dry wt. cells. However, cadmium absorption by A. nicotianae was affected by the solution pH, cadmium concentration, and cell density. The absorption of cadmium was very rapid. Some factors that affected cadmium absorption by A. nicotianae cells were also discussed.",0
"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are components of the innate immune responses that form the first line of host defense against pathogens. Marine mussels can produce a surprising abundance of cysteine-rich AMPs pertaining to the defensin, myticin, mytilin and mytimycin families, particularly in the circulating hemocytes. In the current study, we purified and characterized a novel cysteine-rich peptide with remarkable antibacterial activity from Mytilus coruscus and designated with myticusin-1, a 104-amino acid long polypeptide including 10 cysteine residues forming an unusual cysteine pattern. Antimicrobial assays demonstrated that myticusin-1 exhibited stronger anti-microbial properties against Gram-positive bacteria more than Gram-negative bacteria and fungus. Furthermore, myticusin-1 caused significant morphological alterations in both Sarcina luteus and Escherichia coli as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cDNA of myticusin-1 was cloned and sequenced from the hemocytes cDNA library of M. coruscus. The mRNA transcripts of myticusin-1 are mainly detected in hemocyte, which indicates that myticusin-1 are specifically synthesized and stored in circulating hemocytes. The expression level of myticusin-1 in hemocytes was up-regulated and reached the highest level at 36 h after S. luteus challenge, which was 20-fold increase compared to that of the control group. These results indicated that myticusin-1 was involved in the host immune response against bacterial infection and might contribute to the clearance of invading bacteria. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"The present study was aimed to collect and identify the cyanobacteria from kovalam beach, Tamilnadu, India. Totally three species of marine cyanobacteria were isolated and cultured in BG11 medium. According to their growth characteristics the three species were confirmed with the comparison of the control obtained from NFMC, Tiruchirapalli. They were Oscillatoria sauna, Oscillatoria boryana, Oscillatoria laetrivirans. These cyanobacteria were tested for the production of antimicrobial agents against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, E.coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of the extract were based on the gram character of the cells i.e., antimicrobial activity of ethanol and acetone on the gram negative bacteria and methanol extracts on gram positive bacteria were done.",0
"Objective: To investigate antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Callistemon viminalis (C. viminalis) leaves. Methods: The essential oil of C. viminalis leaves obtained by hydro distillation was analyzed by GC/MS. Different extracts were tested for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and in vitro antioxidant (DPPH assay) and antibacterial (agar disc diffusion and 96 well micro plates methods) actives. Results: Fourteen components were identified in the essential oil, representing 98.94% of the total oil. The major components were 1,8 cineole (64.53%) and alpha-pinene (9.69%). Leaf essential oil exhibited the highest antioxidant activity of (88.60 +/- 1.51)% comparable to gallic acid, a standard compound [(80.00 +/- 2.12)%]. Additionally, the biggest zone of inhibitions against the studied bacterial strains was observed by the essential oil when compared to the standard antibiotic (tetracycline). The crude methanol extract and ethyl acetate fraction had a significant antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains. Conclusions: It can be suggested that C. viminalis is a great potential source of antibacterial and antioxidant compounds useful for new antimicrobial drugs from the natural basis. The present study revealed that the essential oil as well as the methanol extracts and ethyl acetate fraction of C. viminalis leaves exhibited highly significant antibacterial activity against the tested bacterial strains.",0

"Background: Feverfew ( Tanacetum parthenium L.) is a herbal plant that has anti-septic, anti-microbial, anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory effects. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of shoot essential oil (essential oil of the aerial parts of the plant) of the feverfew on a number of microorganisms including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeasts. Materials and Methods: In this empirical study, plant samples were collected at the full blooming stage. Shoot essential oil was extracted using hydro-distillation technique and Clevenger apparatus. Components of the extract were identified using GC and GC/MS apparatus and its antimicrobial properties were evaluated using diffusion in Agar method (disk diffusion) and dilution in the well (Micro-broth dilution). Results: Among 35 compounds identified in the essential oil of the feverfew, camphor (45%), chrysanthenyl acetate (21.5) and camphene (9.6%), were the main components respectively. Essential oil showed very good antifungal effect which was stronger than its antibacterial effect. Gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive to the essential oil than gram-positive bacteria. The mean diameter of inhibition zone, in the bio-assessment of the effect of feverfew essential oil on gram-positive bacteria and fungi was respectively more than the effect of vancomycin and amphotericin B and this effect on gram-negative bacteria was less than the effect of gentamicin. This effect is attributed to the high value of camphor, chrysanthenyl acetate and camphene found in the essential oil. Conclusion: Feverfew essential oil could be utilized as a sound and harmless substitute for the antibiotics.",0
"Depending on the microenvironment, macrophages can acquire distinct functional phenotypes, referred to as classically activated M1 and M2. M1 macrophages are considered potent effector cells that kill intracellular pathogens, and M2 macrophages promote the resolution of wound healing. In this study, we are interested to know whether probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Ba) can induce macrophages polarization. Real-time fluorescence PCR analysis demonstrated that the expression of IL-1 beta, iNOS, TNF-alpha and IL-6 genes for M1 macrophages was significantly increased at 1.5 h after probiotic Ba treatment compared to the probiotic Ba-free treatment (P < 0.01), whereas the expression of M2 macrophage marker genes (Arg1, Fizz1, MR, Ym1) was decreased (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the phagocytic activity was dramatically increased in the Ba-treated BMDMs using a FITC-dextran endocytosis assay. Together, these findings indicated that probiotic Ba facilitated polarization of M1 macrophages and enhanced its phagocytic capacity. The results expanded our knowledge about probiotic function-involved macrophage polarization.",0
"The majority of proteins that are secreted across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane leave the cell via the Sec pathway, which in its minimal form consists of the dimeric ATP-driven motor protein SecA that associates with the protein-conducting membrane pore SecYEG. Some Gram-positive bacteria contain two homologues of SecA, termed SecA1 and SecA2. SecA1 is the essential housekeeping protein, whereas SecA2 is not essential but is involved in the translocation of a subset of proteins, including various virulence factors. Some SecA2 containing bacteria also harbor a homologous SecY2 protein that may form a separate translocase. Interestingly, mycobacteria contain only one SecY protein and thus both SecA1 and SecA2 are required to interact with SecYEG, either individually or together as a heterodimer. In order to address whether SecA1 and SecA2 cooperate during secretion of SecA2 dependent proteins, we examined the oligomeric state of SecA1 and SecA2 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and their interactions with SecA2 and the cognate SecA1, respectively. We conclude that both SecA1 and SecA2 individually form homodimers in solution but when both proteins are present simultaneously, they form dissociable heterodimers.",0
"The study is focused on the endophytic bacterium strain TG116 isolated from the tuber of Typhonium giganteum Engl. Morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of TG116 are identified using 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Antimicrobial characteristics of TG116 are studied using surface spread plate experiment, confront antibiotic culture experiment and differed antagonism procedure. The growth curve, optimum temperature, optimum pH value and salt tolerance of strain TG116 are systematically studied in this paper at the same time. Results show that strain TG116 display a wide range of antifungal spectrum which exhibite antibiotic activities toward all the 7 tested phytopathogens including Phytophthora capsici. The strain can cause the mycelia of fungi into distortion and deformation. According to its morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the strain is preliminarily identified as Bacillus licheniformis. This study can supply new strain resource for the biological control of crop disease and can also provide evidence for exploring and utilizing antimicrobial endophytic bacteria in Typhonium giganteum Engl.",0
"We describe the design and synthesis of a new series of non-natural short cationic lipopeptides (M-W=700) as antimicrobial agents. All of the synthesized lipopeptides were tested against a range of microbes such as Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). By systematic study of design template, we found that three ornithine residues conjugated with myristic acid are minimum requirement for a compound to be an antimicrobial agent. The most potent lipopeptide LP16 possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and has MICs in the range of 1.5-6.25g/mL against Escherichia coli, S.aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and MRSE. All lipopeptides showed high selectivity toward microbial strains as compared to human red blood cells (HC50>250g/mL). Moreover, most potent lipopeptides (LP16 and LP23) did not induce drug resistance in S.aureus even after 15 rounds of passaging. In addition, a representative lipopeptide (LP16) showed tryptic stability for 24h. These results suggest the potential of short cationic lipopeptides to boost the discovery of future antimicrobial therapeutics.",0
"Oilseed crops is an imperative standing in agriculture and industrial economy in Egypt as they are one of the main staple food. So, management of crop problems using novel technologies to prevent pre- and post harvest loss could increase the quality and quantity of the products. Aflatoxins produced primarily by two closely related fungi, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus are carcinogenic in animals and humans. Of many approaches investigated to manage aflatoxin contamination, biological control method has shown great promise. Numerous organisms, including bacteria, yeasts and fungal, have been tested for their ability in controlling aflatoxin contamination. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas putida, Streptomyces aureofaciens and Pichia anomala have shown the ability to inhibit fungal growth and production of aflatoxins by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus in laboratory experiments and they give good efficacies for protection of corn grain crops.",0
"Bacillus subtilis strain NCD-2 is strongly antagonistic toward phytopathogenic fungi, and functions as an excellent biocontrol agent for cotton soil-borne diseases. The aims of this study were to characterize the main active antifungal compound from strain NCD-2 and clarify its role in suppressing cotton damping-off disease. Strain NCD-2 and lipopeptide extract prepared from an NCD-2 culture strongly inhibited the growth of Rhizoctonia solani in vitro. The lipopeptides of strain NCD-2 were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and the antifungal compound was identified as a cluster of fengycin homologs analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A fengycin-deficient mutant was obtained by in-frame deletion of the fengycin synthetase gene in B. subtilis NCD-2. Compared with the wild-type strain, this mutant showed decreased abilities to inhibit the growth of R. solani in vitro and to suppress cotton damping-off disease in vivo. Studies showed that the population of fengycin-deficient mutant was almost same as that of the wild-type NCD-2 strain in the cotton rhizosphere. However, the population of R. solani in the cotton rhizosphere colonized by the fengycindeficient mutant was twice that in the cotton rhizosphere colonized by the NCD-2 wild-type strain. This study demonstrated that fengycin-type lipopeptides are the main antifungal active compounds produced by B. subtilis NCD-2. These compounds play a major role in restricting the population of R. solani in the cotton rhizosphere and in suppressing cotton damping-off disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",0

"There is an urgent need to discover new anti-microbial agents that can overcome the increasing antibiotic resistance posed by multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing bacteria. beta-Lactam antibiotics are structurally related through the presence of a core beta-lactam ring. Resistant pathogens are able to produce beta-lactamase enzymes that hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring and inactivate the antibiotic. One approach to counteract this resistance is to develop beta-lactamase inhibitors, which, on administration with beta-lactams, restores the antibiotic activity for its continued clinical use. In the present study, a fungal Penicillium strain was isolated, identified and characterized for its antimicrobial and beta-lactamase inhibition activities. The strain was identified as Penicillium piceum and was grown in suitable media under submerged cultivation. The antibacterial activity was observed against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Higher antimicrobial activity was observed against gram-positive bacteria as compared to gram-negative bacteria. A certain amount of antifungal activity was also observed against the fungal strains of Penicilium chrysogenum, Rhizopus stolonifer, Fusarium moniliforme, Aspergillus niger, Giberella fujikuroi and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Iodometric and bioassay analyses confirmed that P. piceum produced beta-lactamase inhibitors having activity against penicillinase ( Bacillus cereus). Solvent-solvent extraction with butanol yielded a three-fold increase in beta-lactamase inhibition activity. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the concentrated product proved it to be a single compound. The infrared (IR) spectrum of the compound was compared with the reference IR spectra of sulbactam sodium, tazobactam and potassium clavulanate. It was found to be different thereby inferring the need for extensive structural elucidation for future applications.",0
"The study aimed to investigate the antibacterial activity of Melia azedarach fruit extracts in plant shoot culture. Unripe fruits were collected in different periods and the extracts were obtained through homogenization in an ethanol (EtOH) solution (40 g fresh weight in 100 ml 50 % EtOH) followed by EtOH evaporation. Their activity was tested against isolates of several bacterial species (Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp.) of agronomic interest, and on shoots of 'MRS 2/5' (Prunus cerasifera x Prunus spinosa) and calla lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica) inoculated (bacterized) with Microbacterium oleivorans (Mo), Bacillus subtilis (A17), Sphingomonas meloni (Sm) and Bacillus nealsonii (Bn). Shoot number and fresh weight of explants of 'MRS 2/5' on the proliferation medium and shoot length on the rooting medium were reduced in cultures derived from shoots bacterized with Mo and A17. Moreover, rooting frequency and root number decreased in A17-bacterized shoots. In calla lily, the number of rooted shoots was strongly reduced also by Sm. The extracts had a bactericidal activity against Mo, A17, Bn and most other Bacillus spp. isolates within 2-year trials. This activity remained unchanged against most of the tested bacterial strains after autoclave-sterilization (20 min at 120 A degrees C). The filter-sterilized (0.22-mu m Millipore membrane) extract generally reduced shoot elongation, and caused the death of some 'MRS 2/5'shoots at a 20 % level in the proliferation medium, while all calla lily shoots survived the treatment. It strongly reduced Mo and Bn spread in both plant genotypes, and was even bactericidal against Mo in'MRS 2/5', without showing any negative effect on growth of survived shoots already at the second subculture on standard medium. The HPTLC analysis revealed the prevalence of polyphenols in the extracts from fruits collected in two successive periods; this was consistent with their antimicrobial activity.",0
"The ability to withstand viral predation is critical for survival of most microbes. Accordingly, a plethora of phage resistance systems has been identified in bacterial genomes (Labrie etal, ), including restriction-modification systems (R-M) (Tock & Dryden, ), abortive infection (Abi) (Chopin etal, ), Argonaute-based interference (Swarts etal, ), as well as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated protein (Cas) adaptive immune system (CRISPR-Cas) (Barrangou & Marraffini, ; Van der Oost etal, ). Predictably, the dark matter of bacterial genomes contains a wealth of genetic gold. A study published in this issue of The EMBO Journal by Goldfarb etal () unveils bacteriophage exclusion (BREX) as a novel, widespread bacteriophage resistance system that provides innate immunity against virulent and temperate phage in bacteria.",0
"A survey of potato fields located in the south-eastern region of Himachal Pradesh (India) was carried out in order to find out the natural pathogens infecting the white grub, Brahmina coriacea. About 88 % population of the infected grubs were found to exhibit symptoms of natural bacterial infection during the years 2007-2008. Hence, we attempted to isolate and characterize the most potent bacteria for the management of B. coriacea and tested their insecticidal activity. In this study, ten different bacterial isolates belonging to genera Bacillus, Psychrobacter, Paracoccus, Paenibacillus, Mycobacterium, Staphylococcus and Novosphingobium were isolated from B. coriacea. Bacterial species were identified based on morphology, biochemical tests and homologies of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Pathogenicity tests for all isolated bacteria at 1.0 x 10(8) cfu/ml of broth were performed on late first instar grubs. Among the bacteria tested, Bacillus cereus induced highest mortality level of 51.85 % within 7 days of treatment followed by Psychrobacter pulmonis (33.33 %), Bacillus psychrodurans (25.93 %), Bacillus pumilus (25.93 %), Paenibacillus tylopili (22.22 %) and Novosphingobium capsulatum (18.52 %). Mortality levels were further increased up to 100 % by B. cereus followed by 88.89 % by P. pulmonis after 30 days of treatment. Our results indicate that B. cereus, P. pulmonis, B. psychrodurans, B. pumilus, P. tylopili and N. capsulatum may be valuable biological control agents for white grubs, B. coriacea.",0
"Bacillomycin L, a natural iturinic lipopeptide produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, is characterized by strong antifungal activities against a variety of agronomically important filamentous fungi including Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn. Prior to this study, the role of membrane permeabilization in the antimicrobial activity of bacillomycin L against plant pathogenic fungi had not been investigated. To shed light on the mechanism of this antifungal activity, the permeabilization of R. solani hyphae by bacillomycin L was investigated and compared with that by amphotericin B, a polyene antibiotic which is thought to act primarily through membrane disruption. Our results derived from electron microscopy, various fluorescent techniques and gel retardation experiments revealed that the antifungal activity of bacillomycin L may be not solely a consequence of fungal membrane permeabilization, but related to the interaction of it with intracellular targets. Our findings provide more insights into the mode of action of bacillomycin Land other iturins, which could in turn help to develop new or improved antifungal formulations or result in novel strategies to prevent fungal spoilage.

"The effects of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) (Bacillus pumilus and Pseudomonas putida) and antagonistic fungi (Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma harzianum) were studied alone and in combination in glasshouse experiments on the growth, chlorophyll catalase and peroxidase activity and on the Fusarium root-rot of pea caused by Fusarium solani f. sp. pisi. Application of PGPR and antagonistic fungi caused a significant increase in growth, chlorophyll, catalase and peroxidase activities of both root-rot fungus inoculated and un-inoculated pea plants. Use of P. putida was more effective in reducing disease severity and improving the growth of root-rot fungus-inoculated plants than A. niger and T. harzianum. The greatest increase in growth, chlorophyll, catalase and peroxidase activities of root-rot fungus-inoculated plants and reduction in disease severity was achieved when A. awamori or B. pumilus was used with P. putida compared to other tested combinations.",0
"Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) binds specifically to peptidoglycan and plays an important role as a pattern recognition receptor in the innate immunity of insects. The cDNA of a short-type PGRP, an open reading frame of 588 bp encoding a polypeptide of 196 amino acids, was cloned from Bombyx mori. A phylogenetic tree was constructed, and the results showed that BmPGRP-S2 was most similar to Drosophila melanogaster PGRP (DmPGRP-SA). The induced expression profile of BmPGRP-S2 in healthy Escherichia coli-and Bacillus subtilis-challenged B. mori was measured using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis. The expression of BmPGRP-S2 was upregulated at 24 h by E. coli and Ba. subtilis challenge. In addition, in the integument of B. mori, RNAi knockdown of BmPGRP-S2 caused an obvious reduction in the transcription expression of the transcription factor Relish and in antibacterial effector genes Attacin, Gloverin, and Moricin. The results indicated that BmPGRP-S2 participates in the signal transduction pathway of B. mori.",0
"Background: 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD), a platform and fuel bio-chemical, can be efficiently produced by Klebsiella pneumonia, K. oxytoca, and Serratia marcescens. However, these strains are opportunistic pathogens and not favorable for industrial application. Although some generally regarded as safe (GRAS) microorganisms have been isolated in recent years, there is still a demand for safe 2,3-BD producing strains with high productivity and yield under thermophilic fermentation. Results: Bacillus licheniformis strain 10-1-A was newly isolated for 2,3-BD production. The optimum temperature and medium pH were 50 degrees C and pH 7.0 for 2,3-BD production by strain 10-1-A. The medium composition was optimized through Plackett-Burman design and response surface methodology techniques. With a two-stage agitation speed control strategy, 115.7 g/L of 2,3-BD was obtained from glucose by fed-batch fermentation in a 5-L bioreactor with a high productivity (2.4 g/L.h) and yield (94% of its theoretical value). The 2,3-BD produced by strain 10-1-A comprises (2R,3R)-2,3-BD and meso-2,3-BD with a ratio of nearly 1:1. The bdh and gdh genes encoding meso-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (meso-BDH) and glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) of strain 10-1-A were expressed in Escherichia coli and the proteins were purified. meso-2,3-BD and (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD were transformed from racemic acetoin by meso-BDH and GDH with NADH, respectively. Conclusions: Compared with the reported GRAS 2,3-BD producers, B. licheniformis 10-1-A could thermophilically produce 2,3-BD with a high concentration, productivity and yield. Thus, the newly isolated GRAS strain 10-1-A might be a promising strain for industrial production of 2,3-BD. Two key enzymes for meso-2,3-BD and (2R, 3R)-2,3-BD production were purified and further studied, and this might be helpful to understand the mechanism for 2,3-BD stereoisomers forming in B. licheniformis.",0
"Background: Honey has multiple therapeutic properties due to its composition with diverse components. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of Saharan honeys against bacterial pathogens, the variation of honey floral origins, and its physicochemical characteristics. Materials and Methods: The antimicrobial activity of 32 samples of honey collected from the Algerian Sahara Desert was tested on four bacteria; Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli. and Staphylococcus aureus. The botanical origin of honeys and their physicochemical properties were determined and their combined antibacterial effects were modeled using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Results: Out of the 32 study samples, 14 were monofloral and 18 were multifloral. The pollen density was on average 7.86 x 10(6) grains/10 g of honey, water content was 14.6%, electrical conductivity (EC) was 0.5 mu S/cm, pH was 4.38 +/- 0 50, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content was 82 mg/kg of honey, total sugars = 83%, reducing sugars = 71%, and the concentration of proline = 525.5 +/- 550.2 mg/kg of honey. GLMM revealed that the antibacterial effect of honey varied significantly between bacteria and floral origins. This effect increased with increasing of water content and reducing sugars in honey, but it significantly decreased with increase of honey EC. E. coli was the most sensitive species with an inhibition zone of 10.1 +/- 4.7 mm, while C. perfringens was the less sensitive. Honeys dominated by pollen of Fabaceae sp. were most effective with an overall antimicrobial activity equals to 13.5 +/- 4.7 mm. Conclusion: Saharan honeys, of certain botanical origins, have physicochemical and pollinic characteristics with relevant potential for antibacterial purposes. This encourages a more comprehensive characterization of honeys with in vivo and in vitro investigations.",0
"A series of ten 4-(4-(dimethylamino)benzylidene)-1-(4-(3-(aryl)acryloyl) phenyl)-2-phenyl-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-ones (7) have been synthesized by condensation of 1-(4-acetylphenyl)-4-(4-(dimethylamino)benzylidene)-2-phenyl-1H-imidazol -5(4H)-one (5) with different aryl aldehydes (6). The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, Mass spectral studies and elemental analysis. All the above compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against gram positive bacteria B. subtilis, S. aureus, gram negative bacteria E. coli, P. vulgaris and the yeast C. albicans. These compounds were also tested for antioxidant activity by DPPH method and were found to be biologically active.",0
"In prokaryotes, a conserved small RNA molecule, called tmRNA, rescues ribosomes from proteins that are abnormally truncated due to the presence of rare codons or degraded mRNA. During the rescue process, a peptide tag (SsrA) encoded by tmRNA is cotranslationally added to the truncated polypeptides, thereby targeting these proteins for proteolytic degradation. In Escherichia coli, ClpXP and ClpAP proteases primarily degrade SsrA-tagged proteins. Other proteases such as Lon and FtsH also participate in the degradation in E. coll. However, in Bacillus subtilis, ClpXP is the major protease that degrades the SsrA-tagged proteins. Degradation of SsrA-tagged protein in streptococci is not well understood except that ClpXP is responsible for the majority of the degradation. Here we show that in Streptococcus mutans, in addition to ClpXP, two other Clp complexes, ClpCP and ClpEP, are also involved in the degradation. We also found that ClpCP- and ClpEP-mediated proteolysis of SsrA-tagged substrates is induced by heat stress. As ClpCP and ClpEP proteins are highly conserved in streptococci, we predicted that ClpEP- and ClpCP-mediated degradation of SsrA-tagged proteins might be operational in other streptococci.",0
"Meloidoyne incognita (root-knot nematode) and Fusarium solani (root-rot pathogen) were the common soil-borne pathogens and cause severe damage to bean plants in newly reclaimed sandy soil in Nubaryia district, Behera Governorate, Egypt. The antagonistic effects of Trichoderma album and Trichoderma viride as well as three commercial products namely Rhizo-N (R) (Bacillus subtilis), Bio-Arc (R) 6% (Bacillus megaterium) and Bio-Zeid (R) 2.5% (T. album) were tested against M. incognita and F. solani under naturally infected field conditions. T. album and T. viride highly reduced the frequency (%) population of pathogenic fungi such as Fusarium spp., F. solani and Rhizoctonia spp., than the commercial products. Results indicated that all the tested bio-control agents reduced, significantly, the nematode criteria as evidenced by the number of juvenile (J(2)) in soil and number of galls and egg masses on roots of common bean and Fusarium root-rot incidence (%). Rhizo-N (R) highly reduced the number of J(2) in soil, while T. album was the best in reducing the number of galls and egg masses in roots. The bio-control agents also increased the plant growth parameters of common bean plants i.e. plant height, plant weight, branch no./plant, pods no./plant, pod weight/plant, pod weight, seeds no./plant, fresh seeds weight/pod, dry seeds weight/pod and dry weight of 100 seeds.",0
"During surgery with bone grafting, the impaction of bone tissue creates an avascular area where local circulation is disrupted. If infections arise, they may prevent systemically administered antibiotics from reaching the infected bone. In this study we evaluated gentamicin palmitate (GP) mixed with gentamicin sulfate (GS) as a coating for bone chips (BCh). The efficacy of the coated BCh was measured by gentamicin base release tests using B. subtilis, S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Gentamicin base release was evaluated in phosphate-buffered saline for up to 7 days using B. subtilis bioassay. Antimicrobial efficacy was tested with S. aureus and S. epidermidis. A significant difference on the release of gentamicin base between GS and GS + GP was observed. S. epidermidis are significantly more susceptible to GS + GP and GS than S. aureus. BCh can act as gentamicin carriers and showed efficacy against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.",0
"The GAF domain located in the N-terminal motifs of CodY (N-CodY) is responsible for increasing the affinity of CodY to its target sites on DNA by its interaction with the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) involving isoleucine, leucine and valine. The study of the interaction of GAF domain with isoleucine gains much attention in recent years, but the mechanism of isoleucine release still remains unclear. In this paper, a conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and force probe molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations have been performed with the aim to understand how the isoleucine ligand escapes from the GAF domain of N-CodY from Bacillus subtilis. The MD results reveal that the ligand release is a gradual process, which is accompanied by the movement of the loop between beta 3 and beta 4. During the periods of ligand escaping from the bottom to the top of binding pocket, isoleucine forms hydrogen bonds one after another with series of residues, such as ARG61, THR96, PHE98, VAL100, GLU101 and ASN102, under the mediation of hydrophobic contacts. The FPMD results show that the easiest way to pull ligand out of the cavity is along x direction (i.e. the direction is opposite to MET62). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Brilacidin (PMX30063) has shown potent bactericidal activity against drug-resistant and - susceptible strains of multiple Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. In this study, we demonstrate that brilacidin causes membrane depolarization in the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, to an extent comparable to that caused by the lipopeptidic drug daptomycin. Transcriptional profiling of Staphylococcus aureus by deep sequencing shows that the global response to brilacidin treatment is well correlated to those of treatment with daptomycin and the cationic antimicrobial peptide LL37 and mostly indicates abrogation of cell wall and membrane functions. Furthermore, the upregulation of various chaperones and proteases by brilacidin and daptomycin indicates that cytoplasmic protein misfolding stress may be a contributor to the mechanism of action of these drugs. These stress responses were orchestrated mainly by three two-component systems, GraSR, VraSR, and NsaSR, which have been implicated in virulence and drug resistance against other clinically available antibiotics.",0
"A series of bio-composites including poly3-hydroxybutyrate [P(3HB)] grafted ethyl cellulose (EC) stated as P(3HB)-EC were successfully synthesised. Furthermore, natural phenols e.g., p-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA) and ferulic acid (FA) were grafted onto the newly developed P(3HB)-EC-based bio-composites under laccase-assisted environment without the use of additional initiators or crosslinking agents. The phenol grafted bio-composites were critically evaluated for their antibacterial and biocompatibility features as well as their degradability in soil. In particular, the results of the antibacterial evaluation for the newly developed bio-composites indicated that 20HBA-g-P(3HB)-EC and 15FA-g-P(3HB)-EC biocomposites exerted strong bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity against Gram(-) E. coli NTCT 10418 as compared to the Gram(+) B. subtilis NCTC 3610. This study shows further that at various phenolic concentrations the newly synthesised bio-composites remained cytocompatible with human keratinocyte-like HaCaT skin cells, as 100% cell viability was recorded, in vitro. As for the degradation, an increase in the degradation rate was recorded during the soil burial analyses over a period of 42 days. These findings suggest that the reported bio-composites have great potential for use in wound healing; covering the affected skin area which may favour tissue repair over shorter periods.

"Sixty years after Hershey and Chase showed that nucleic acid is the major component of phage particles that is ejected into cells, we still do not fully understand how the process occurs. Advances in electron microscopy have revealed the structure of the condensed DNA confined in a phage capsid, and the mechanisms and energetics of packaging a phage genome are beginning to be better understood. Condensing DNA subjects it to high osmotic pressure, which has been suggested to provide the driving force for its ejection during infection. However, forces internal to a phage capsid cannot, alone, cause complete genome ejection into cells. Here, we describe the structure of the DNA inside mature phages and summarize the current models of genome ejection, both in vitro and in vivo.",0
"Electrochemical oxidation of catechols in the presence of 4-mercapto-benzoic acid as nucleophile have been studied in aqueous acetate buffer solution using cyclic voltammetry and control potential coulometry. The cyclic voltammetric results showed that an electro oxidative/Michael type sequential reaction occurs between the 4-mercaptide anion and electrochemically generated o-bezoquinones leading to the corresponding products 4a-4b. The mechanism electrochemical reaction is proved as an EC pathway using controlled-potential coulometry. The antimicrobial activity of these newly synthesized compounds were screened against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria namely, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli. These newly syntheses compounds showed good antimicrobial activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"During acute infection with bacteria, viruses or parasites, a fraction of macrophages engulf large numbers of red and white blood cells, a process called hemophagocytosis. Hemophagocytes persist into the chronic stage of infection and have an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of immunocompetent mice results in acute followed by chronic infection, with the accumulation of hemophagocytes. The mechanism(s) that triggers a macrophage to become hemophagocytic is unknown, but it has been reported that the proinflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) is responsible. We show that primary macrophages become hemophagocytic in the absence or presence of IFN-gamma upon infection with Gram-negative bacterial pathogens or prolonged exposure to heat-killed Salmonella enterica, the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, or Mycobacterium marinum. Moreover, conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns are sufficient to stimulate macrophages to hemophagocytose. Purified bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced hemophagocytosis in resting and IFN-gamma-pretreated macrophages, whereas lipoteichoic acid and synthetic unmethylated deoxycytidine-deoxyguanosine dinucleotides, which mimic bacterial DNA, induced hemophagocytosis only in IFN-gamma-pretreated macrophages. Chemical inhibition or genetic deletion of Toll-like receptor 4, a pattern recognition receptor responsive to LPS, prevented both Salmonella- and LPS-stimulated hemophagocytosis. Inhibition of NF-kappaB also prevented hemophagocytosis. These results indicate that recognition of microbial products by Toll-like receptors stimulates hemophagocytosis, a novel outcome of prolonged Toll-like receptor signaling, suggesting hemophagocytosis is a highly conserved innate immune response.",0
"Phospholipid-modified solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) of Phospholipon(R) 90G and 90H encapsulating the hydrophilic drug, gentamicin were produced and loaded into three polymeric hydrogels of Poloxamer 407 and polyacrylic acids (Carbopols(R) 971P and 974P). The SLMs were characterized by morphology and particle size, drug encapsulation efficiency, thermal properties, pH, and storage stability, whereas the microgels were evaluated for viscosity, spreadability, pH, drug content, and in vitro antimicrobial drug release against five microorganisms (Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Our results generally showed Poloxamer 407 microgels of P90H and P90G as having the most desirable properties in terms of fast antibacterial activity on all tested microorganisms, in vitro diffusion-dependent permeation through rat abdominal skin, spreadability, pH, and viscosity, superior to polyacrylic acids microgels.

"Synthesis, characterization and investigation of antimicrobial activity of 11 novel adamantanyl-thiazoles are presented. Their structures were determined using H-1 and C-13 NMR, EI(+)-MS, HRMS, and elemental analyses. Among the derivatives, compound 3c showed very strong activity, especially against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019 with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 1.95 to 7.81 mu g/ml. Compounds 3a and 3b showed good antifungal activity. Among the examined compounds, the widest spectrum of antibacterial activity possessed 3f that showed good activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 10240, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 with MIC values ranging from 31.25 to 62.5 mu g/ml. Molecular docking studies of all compounds on the active sites of microbial enzymes indicated possible targets sterol 14-demethylase, secreted aspartic proteinase (SAP), N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), and topoisomerase II.

"Effects of dietary administration of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FPTB16 on systemic and mucosal immunity and disease resistance of catla (Catla catla) against Edwardsiella tarda infection were evaluated in the present study. The laboratory maintained B. amyloliquefaciens was used to study antagonistic activity against fish pathogenic bacteria by agar well diffusion assay. Healthy catla were challenged by this bacterium for determination of its safety. For preparation of probiotic supplemented diet, the bacteria were added to the basal diet (control) at three different inclusion levels i.e., 1 x 10(9), 1 x 10(8) and 1 x 10(7) CFU/g diet. Fish (weight 25-30 g) were fed with these diets and various immune parameters and disease resistance study were conducted at 4 weeks and 8 weeks post-feeding. The bacterial antagonism study showed inhibition zone against E. tarda, Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi. B. amyloliquefaciens was harmless to catla as neither mortalities nor morbidities were observed after the challenge. Study of different systemic and mucosal immunological parameters viz. superoxide anion production and nitric oxide production, myeloperoxidase content, lysozyme activity and total protein content showed significant enhancement (p < 0.05) in fish fed with 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens at both time points with the highest values observed in case of 10(9) CFU/g. For fish fed with 10(7) CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens, all the parameters showed significant enhancement (p < 0.05) at both time points except the lysozyme activity of serum at 8 weeks. Diet containing 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/g B. amyloliquefaciens significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) the resistance of catla against bacterial challenge at both time points. These results collectively suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens is a potential probiotic species and can be used in aquaculture to improve health status and disease resistance with an optimal dietary supplementation of 10(9) CFU/g.

"The acquisition of antibiotic resistance by human pathogens poses a significant threat to public health. The mechanisms that control the proliferation and expression of antibiotic resistance genes are not yet completely understood. The aminoglycosides are a historically important class of antibiotics that were introduced in the 1940s. Aminoglycoside resistance is conferred most commonly through enzymatic modification of the drug or enzymatic modification of the target rRNA through methylation or through the overexpression of efflux pumps. In our recent paper, we reported that expression of the aminoglycoside resistance genes encoding the aminoglycoside acetyl transferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenyl transferase (AAD) enzymes was controlled by an aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch RNA. This riboswitch is embedded in the leader RNA of the aac/aad genes and is associated with the integron cassette system. The leader RNA can sense and bind specific aminoglycosides such that the binding causes a structural transition in the leader RNA, which leads to the induction of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance. Specific aminoglycosides induce reporter gene expression mediated by the leader RNA. Aminoglycoside RNA binding was measured directly and, aminoglycoside-induced changes in RNA structure monitored by chemical probing. UV cross-linking and mutational analysis identified potential aminoglycoside binding sites on the RNA.",0
"A novel use of Titania nanoparticles as agents in the nano interface interaction between a beneficial plant growth promoting bacterium (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens UCMB5113) and oilseed rape plants (Brassica napus) for protection against the fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicae is presented. Two different TiO2 nanoparticle material were produced by the Sol-Gel approach, one using the patented Captigel method and the other one applying TiBALDH precursor. The particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering and nano particle tracking analysis. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the bacterium was living in clusters on the roots and the combined energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis revealed that titanium was present in these cluster formations. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further demonstrated an increased bacterial colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots and a semi-quantitative microscopic assay confirmed an increased bacterial adhesion to the roots. An increased amount of adhered bacteria was further confirmed by quantitative fluorescence measurements. The degree of infection by the fungus was measured and quantified by real-timeq-PCR. Results showed that Titania nanoparticles increased adhesion of beneficial bacteria on to the roots of oilseed rape and protected the plants against infection.",0
"Probiotic and potential probiotic bacterial strains are routinely prescribed and used as supplementary therapy for a variety infectious diseases, including enteric disorders among a wide range of individuals. While there are an increasing number of studies defining the possible mechanisms of probiotic activity, a great deal remains unknown regarding the diverse modes of action attributed to these therapeutic agents. More precise information is required to support the appropriate application of probiotics. To address this objective, we selected two probiotics strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus MTCC-10307 (LA) and Bacillus clausii MTCC-8326 (BC) that are frequently prescribed for the treatment of intestinal disorders and investigated their effects on the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line. Our results reveal that LA and BC are potent activators of both metabolic activity and innate immune responses in these cells. We also observed that LA and BC possessed similar activity in preventing infection simulated in vitro in murine macrophages by Salmonella typhimurium serovar Enterica.

"Degradation of non-volatile organic compounds-environmental toxins (methyltriclosane and phenanthrene), bovine serum albumin, as well as bioparticles (Legionella pneumophila, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus anthracis)-in a commercially available plasma air purifier based on a cold plasma was studied in detail, focusing on its efficiency and on the resulting degradation products. This system is capable of handling air flow velocities of up to 3.0 m s(-1) (3200 L min(-1)), much higher than other plasma-based reactors described in the literature, which generally are limited to air flow rates below 10 L min(-1). Mass balance studies consistently indicated a reduction in concentration of the compounds/particles after passage through the plasma air purifier, 31% for phenanthrene, 17% for methyltriclosane, and 80% for bovine serum albumin. L. pneumophila did not survive passage through the plasma air purifier, and cell counts of aerosolized spores of B. subtilis and B. anthracis were reduced by 26- and 15-fold, depending on whether it was run at 10 Hz or 50 Hz, respectively. However rather than chemical degradation, deposition on the inner surfaces of the plasma air purifier occured. Our interpretation is that putative ""degradation"" efficiencies were largely due to electrostatic precipitation rather than to decomposition into smaller molecules. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Early blight is an economically important foliar disease of processing and fresh market tomatoes. The aim of this multi-year field study was to investigate the impact of weekly foliar sprays of dried and aqueous formulations of Bacillus subtilis QST 713 (Serenade and Rhapsody), alone or as tank mixes with copper hydroxide, on early blight disease development and fruit yields of tomato. Field plots were established in London, Ontario during the 2008-2010 growing seasons and disease conditions were created artificially by inoculations with spore suspension of the early blight pathogen. The tank mixes of copper hydroxide and chlorothalonil were included as a standard spray treatment. Late blight also appeared naturally in the plots late in 2009 and 2010 field seasons and affected fruit in both years, but more severely in 2009. Spray treatments had variable effects on tomato early blight and fruit yields depending on the level of disease pressure in the inoculated plots. The weekly sprays of biofungicide alone did not consistently reduce disease severity on tomato foliage or incidence on fruit, but in a tank mix with copper hydroxide, both formulations consistently reduced foliar disease severity even when disease pressure was high in plots. Under high disease conditions, copper hydroxide alone or as a tank mix with chlorothalonil also consistently reduced disease severity on foliage. The mixture of two fungicides also consistently increased total fruit yields in all 3 years. Plots sprayed with copper hydroxide alone and in tank mixes with chlorothalonil and the dried formulation of biofungicide consistently had less late blight-infected fruit. The combined effects of biofungicides and copper hydroxide or other fungicides should be further investigated for consistent disease management and yield improvement.",0
"Background: Lantibiotics are heat-stable peptides characterized by the presence of thioether amino acid lanthionine and methyllanthionine. They are capable to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus, the causative agents of food-borne diseases or nosocomial infections. Lantibiotic biosynthetic machinery is encoded by gene cluster composed by a structural gene that codes for a pre-lantibiotic peptide and other genes involved in pre-lantibiotic modifications, regulation, export and immunity. Methodology/Findings: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GA1 was found to produce an antimicrobial peptide, named amylolysin, active on an array of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin resistant S. aureus. Genome characterization led to the identification of a putative lantibiotic gene cluster that comprises a structural gene (amlA) and genes involved in modification (amlM), transport (amlT), regulation (amlKR) and immunity (amlFE). Disruption of amlA led to loss of biological activity, confirming thus that the identified gene cluster is related to amylolysin synthesis. MALDI-TOF and LC-MS analysis on purified amylolysin demonstrated that this latter corresponds to a novel lantibiotic not described to date. The ability of amylolysin to interact in vitro with the lipid II, the carrier of peptidoglycan monomers across the cytoplasmic membrane and the presence of a unique modification gene suggest that the identified peptide belongs to the group B lantibiotic. Amylolysin immunity seems to be driven by only two AmlF and AmlE proteins, which is uncommon within the Bacillus genus. Conclusion/Significance: Apart from mersacidin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains Y2 and HIL Y-85,544728, reports on the synthesis of type B-lantibiotic in this species are scarce. This study reports on a genetic and structural characterization of another representative of the type B lantibiotic in B. amyloliquefaciens.",0
"Innovative strategies are needed to combat drug resistance associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here, we investigate the potential of wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis inhibitors as combination agents to restore beta-lactam efficacy against MRSA. Performing a whole-cell pathway-based screen, we identified a series of WTA inhibitors (WTAIs) targeting the WTA transporter protein, TarG. Whole-genome sequencing of WTAI-resistant isolates across two methicillin-resistant Staphylococci spp. revealed TarG as their common target, as well as a broad assortment of drug-resistant bypass mutants mapping to earlier steps of WTA biosynthesis. Extensive in vitro microbiological analysis and animal infection studies provide strong genetic and pharmacological evidence of the potential effectiveness of WTAIs as anti-MRSA beta-lactam combination agents. This work also highlights the emerging role of whole-genome sequencing in antibiotic mode-of-action and resistance studies.",0
"Clubroot disease, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, is a serious soil-borne disease of crucifer worldwide, and it can significantly reduce yield and quality. Although some agrochemicals have been used to manage clubroot and can provide effective control, increasing use of chemical inputs causes several negative effects. In this study, using Chinese cabbage ( Brassica rapa L. subsp. chinensis) as the test crop, we developed an effective nonchemical method that would protect the roots against P. brassicae infection by using a combination heat treatment and a cocktail of biocontrol agents. The data showed that this method could cause 91.7% inhibition of P. brassicae infection. The average height of plants (13.5 cm) using this method was about twice higher than that in control group (6.7 cm), and the average plant weight (3.19 g) was about three times increased compared to that in control set (1.23 g).",0
"Essential gene studies often reveal novel essential functions for genes with dispensable homologues in other species. This is the case with the widespread family of electron transfer flavoproteins (ETFs), which are required for the metabolism of specific substrates or for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in some bacteria. Despite these non-essential functions high-throughput screens have identified ETFs as putatively essential in several species. In this study, we constructed a conditional expression mutant of one of the ETFs in Burkholderia cenocepacia, and demonstrated that its expression is essential for growth on both complex media and a variety of single-carbon sources. We further demonstrated that the two subunits EtfA and EtfB interact with each other, and that cells depleted of ETF are non-viable and lack redox potential. These cells also transition from the short rods characteristic of Burkholderia cenocepacia to small spheres independently of MreB. The putative membrane partner ETF dehydrogenase also induced the same rod-to-sphere change. We propose that the ETF of Burkholderia cenocepacia is a novel antibacterial target.",0
"Background: Tuberculosis is responsible for the world's leading cause of death affecting one third of the world's population by the latent or dormant form despite the current chemotherapy. For the effective management of MDR or XDR-TB, new lead compounds or novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed. The present investigation is aimed at creating a new and hitherto unreported molecular framework encompassing isoxazole moiety with carboxamide derivatives for the antitubercular activity. Methods: 5-methylisoxazole-3-carboxamide derivatives (4-20) were synthesized in good yield and were characterised by, spectral studies. In vitro antitubercular activity of the synthesized compounds was determined against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv by MABA method and in vitro antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli by serial dilution method. Results: The titled compounds, 10 and 14 showed significant antitubercular activity with MIC of 3.125 mu M and 9 and 13 with MIC of 6.25 mu M among the tested compounds. The active compounds have shown good safety profile against Vero and HepG2 Cell lines. The compounds 9, 13, 19 and 20 showed significant antibacterial activity with MIC of 6.25 mu M and 15 and 17 showed activity with MIC of 12.5 mu M among the tested compounds. Conclusion: In conclusion, we reported the convenient synthetic method for the 5-methylisoxazole-3-carboxamides. The results of antitubercular activity were encouraging. With structure base drug design approach and suitable molecular modifications of the synthesized compounds 9, 10, 13 and 14, it is possible to develop lead molecule with better antitubercular potential.",0
"The SOS response is an essential process for responding to DNA damage in bacteria. The expression of SOS genes is under the control of LexA, a global transcription factor that undergoes self-cleavage during stress to allow the expression of DNA repair functions and delay cell division until the damage is rectified. LexA also regulates genes that are not part of this cell rescue program, and the induction of bacteriophages, the movement of pathogenicity islands, and the expression of virulence factors and bacteriocins are all controlled by this important transcription factor. Recently it has emerged that when regulating the expression of genes from mobile genetic elements (MGEs), LexA often does so in concert with a corepressor. This accessory regulator can either be a host-encoded global transcription factor, which responds to various metabolic changes, or a factor that is encoded for by the MGE itself. Thus, the coupling of LexA-mediated regulation to a secondary transcription factor not only detaches LexA from its primary SOS role, but also fine-tunes gene expression from the MGE, enabling it to respond to multiple stresses. Here we discuss the mechanisms of such coordinated regulation and its implications for cells carrying such MGEs.",0
"Disease associated with Clostridium difficile infection is caused by the actions of the homologous toxins TcdA and TcdB on colonic epithelial cells. Binding to target cells triggers toxin internalization into acidified vesicles, whereupon cryptic segments from within the 1,050-aa translocation domain unfurl and insert into the bounding membrane, creating a transmembrane passageway to the cytosol. Our current understanding of the mechanisms underlying pore formation and the subsequent translocation of the upstream cytotoxic domain to the cytosol is limited by the lack of information available regarding the identity and architecture of the transmembrane pore. Here, through systematic perturbation of conserved sites within predicted membrane-insertion elements of the translocation domain, we uncovered highly sensitive residues-clustered between amino acids 1,035 and 1,107-that when individually mutated, reduced cellular toxicity by as much as >1,000-fold. We demonstrate that defective variants are defined by impaired pore formation in planar lipid bilayers and biological membranes, resulting in an inability to intoxicate cells through either apoptotic or necrotic pathways. These findings along with the unexpected similarities uncovered between the pore-forming ""hotspots"" of TcdB and the well-characterized a-helical diphtheria toxin translocation domain provide insights into the structure and mechanism of formation of the translocation pore for this important class of pathogenic toxins.",0
