Funk","The need for human breast cancer resistance protein substrate and inhibition evaluation in drug discovery and development: Why, when, and how?","Although the multiplicity in transport proteins assessed during drug development is continuously increasing, the clinical relevance of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is still under debate. Here, our aim is to rationalize the need to consider BCRP substrate and inhibitor interactions and to define optimum selection and acceptance criteria between cell-based and vesicle-based assays in vitro. Information on the preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), drug-drug interactions, and pharmacogenomics data was collated for 13 marketed drugs whose PK is reportedly associated with BCRP interaction. Clinical examples where BCRP impacts drug PK and efficacy appear to be rare and confounded by interactions with other transporters. Thirty-seven compounds were selected to be tested as BCRP substrates in a cell-based assay using MDCKII cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells) and 18 in membrane vesicles. Depending on the physicochemical compound properties, we observed both in vitro systems to give false-negative readouts. In addition, the inhibition potential of 19 compounds against BCRP was assessed in vesicles and in MDCKII cells, where we observed significant system and substrate-dependent IC 50 values. Therefore, neither of the two test systems is superior to the other. Instead, one system may offer advantages under certain situations (e.g., low permeability) and thus should be selected based on the physicochemical compound properties. Finally, given the clinical relevance of BCRP, we propose that its evaluation should remain issue-driven: for low permeable, low bioavailable drugs, in particular when other more common processes do not allow a mechanistic understanding of any unexpected absorption or brain disposition, and for drugs with a low therapeutic window.

DESIGN: The expression status and the role of PRICKLE-1 in the regulation of REST and its downstream markers were analyzed in normal human myometrium and UL. Additionally, the effect of modulating PRICKLE-1 expression on REST was analyzed in vitro using primary SMCs derived from patient samples and in vivo using animal models treated with estrogenic compounds. n=10. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UL and myometrial tissue samples were obtained from women undergoing hysterectomy. Samples were analyzed for Pk-1 and RESTexpression and used for primary cell cultures treated with Pk- 1 siRNA and a Pk-1 expression vector, followed by gene expression analysis. Uteri from animal models, including Lhb null, Esr null, genistein-treated and DES-treated mice were used to determine Pk-1 sensitivity to estrogens in vivo. RESULTS: UL are hormone-responsive, benign tumors of the myometrium. Prepubertal environmental estrogen exposure is a major risk factor for UL. Extensive evidence has indicated the central role of overactive PI3K/AKT-mTOR signaling in UL. Importantly, the tumor suppressor REST (repressor element silencing transcription factor) is lost in UL, leading to aberrant expression of the PI3K/AKT-mTOR pathway. We report a critical link between environmental estrogens and REST dependent epigenetic modifications, via Pk-1, an interacting partner of REST required for its nuclear localization. We found silencing of Pk-1 by siRNA results in the loss of REST in normal uterine SMCs and the overexpression of Pk-1 leads to increased REST in UL SMCs. Further, we report a novel E2-ERa mediated regulation of Pk-1. Lhb null mice lacking endogenous E2 showed increased Pk-1 expression, and subsequent E2 treatment rescued Pk-1 to wild-type levels. Further, Esr1 null mice expressed high levels of Pk-1 in the uterus and mice exposed neonatally to environmental estrogens expressed strikingly low levels of Pk-1. CONCLUSION: Our results identify Pk-1 as a novel link between estrogen stimulation and downstream REST-dependent tumorigenic signaling pathways in UL pathogenesis.",NA,"*exposure *uterus myoma *society *reproduction mouse female human uterus myometrium knockout mouse animal model expression vector normal human primary cell culture stimulation hysterectomy wild type tissues repressor gene neoplasm risk factor patient benign tumor gene expression in vitro study pathogenesis down regulation *estrogen small interfering RNA marker transcription factor hormone genistein","e285","102","2014",-1

Guray","Effect of phytoestrogen emodin on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis on tumorigenic MCF-7 and nontumorigenic MCF-10A human breast cells","Emodin (3-Methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone), is a phytoestrogenic component of Rheum and Polygonum plant extracts which has been used to treat several diseases since ancient times. It has been shown to have anti-microbial, anti-oxidant and anticancer effects in nature. The anti-tumor drug doxorubicin, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, is used for the treatment of many cancer types including lung, gastric, ovarian and breast cancer. In this study, the effects of pre-, co- and alone treatment of doxorubicin and emodin in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cell lines were investigated. MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of emodin and doxorubicin at 6, 24 and 72 hours. The effect of emodin varies according to the presence of doxorubicin (pre-treatment, co-treatment, post-treatment) on both cell lines. Emodin pre-treatment (0.4 and 4 muM) for 24-hour prior to doxorubicin treatment (0.1, 0.83, 2.5 muM) caused to increase in cell viability of MCF-10A cells, comparing to doxorubicin alone treatment. Whereas no effect was observed in MCF-7 cells. Emodin post- and co-treatment with doxorubicin for 72- hour inhibited the survival of MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells in a concentration dependent manner, shown by trypan blue and XTT. Apoptotic effects of doxorubicin and emodin were investigated by flow cytometer. While emodin (0.4 muM) did not induce apoptosis in both cell lines, doxorubicin alone, pre- and co-treatment (0.83 muM) with emodin (0.4 muM) induced late apoptosis/necrosis in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells.

Lin","Treatment with qi bao mei ran, a kidney-invigorating chinese herbal formula, antagonizes estrogen decline in ovariectomized rats","Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) contain multi-interactive compounds that have been used for treatment of peri-menopausal syndrome and have become a new phytoestrogens resource. The QiBaoMeiRan formula (QBMR), including Polygoni Multiflori Radix, Angelicae Sinensis Radix, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Semen Cuscutae, Fructus Lycii, Poria, and Fructus Psoraleae, has been used clinically for treating osteoporosis in post-menopausal women by virtue of its kidney-invigorating function. However, no evidence base links QBMR to estrogen replacement therapy. In this study, we undertook a characterization of estrogenic activity of QBMR using ovariectomized (OVX) rats. OVX rats were treated with QBMR at doses of 0.875, 1.75, and 3.5 grams/kg per day for 8 weeks. QBMR treatments demonstrated significant estrogenic activity, as indicated by vaginal cornification, reversal of atrophy of uterus, vagina, and mammary gland, and up-regulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) expression in the reproductive target tissues, where ERbeta up-regulation was stronger than that of ERalpha. Meanwhile, treatment with QBMR significantly increased adrenal weight and serum estradiol levels and tended to decrease serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, QBMR significantly decreased weight gain and rectal temperature increase caused by ovariectomy, and the largest changes in rectal temperature were found at the lowest dose. The data suggest that QBMR's estrogenic responses show tissue variation that reflects different affinities of ERs for QBMR components. This study demonstrates that QBMR activity is mediated through estrogenic components and provides an evidence base for QBMR treatment of post-menopausal symptoms. 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue article atrophy Chinese medicine controlled study estradiol blood level estrogen activity female herbal medicine mammary gland nonhuman organ weight ovariectomy priority journal protein expression rat rectum temperature target organ treatment duration upregulation uterus vagina weight gain estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] follitropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *herbaceous agent/pd [Pharmacology] luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] *QiBaoMeiRan/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","372-381","17","2014",-1

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which genistein overcomes chemoresistance and its effect on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Consistent with previous reports, genistein combined with doxorubicin had a synergistic effect on MCF-7/Adr cells, and genistein reduced the chemo-resistance of these cells. Genistein treatment increased the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin but did not influence P-gp function. The combination of genistein and doxorubicin significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Genistein treatment strongly inhibited HER2/neu but not MDR-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, our results demonstrated that genistein combined with doxorubicin had a synergistic effect on MCF-7/Adr cells, and the mechanisms likely involve an increase in the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and suppression of HER2/neu expression.",NA,"apoptosis article *breast cancer *cancer resistance cell cycle arrest cell level controlled study drug accumulation *drug cytotoxicity drug mechanism *drug potentiation gene expression regulation human human cell mcf 7 cell line priority journal protein expression protein function *doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] *doxorubicin/it [Drug Interaction] *doxorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/cb [Drug Combination] *genistein/it [Drug Interaction] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glycoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] multidrug resistance protein 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1647-1653","32","2014",-1

During menopousal period tamoxifen induces the upregulation of estrogen and progesterone receptors in endometrial tissue. Here we presented a giant endometrial polyp in a postmenopausal woman which is not associated with hormone treatment. Method: Case presentation. Results: A 70 year-old woman (G7P7, in menopause for 20 years) presented to our hospital, department of orthopedics with lower back pain. Physical examination revealed no pathology. She didn't have any other systemic disease. She didn't have any history of hormone therapy but she admitted drinking too much thyme for many years. Computed tomography examination was performed and an endometrial mass with a diameter of 9x10 cmwas detected. After total abdominal hysterectomy, a giant endometrial polyp measured 16x10x5 cm was seen, macroscopically. Microscopic examination with serial sections confirmed the diagnosis as benign endometrial polyp. Conclusion: Phytoestrogens such as thyme were reported to be highest ER-binding herbs.

Smith","An in vitro investigation of Estrogen Receptor beta 2 (ERbeta2) nuclear speckles in breast cancer","Objective: ERbeta is a nuclear transcription factor existing as at least 5 isoforms. ERbeta2 is present in nuclear and cytoplasmic components of mammalian cells, but most frequently as nuclear speckles in breast cancer cells. We aimed to investigate regulation of these speckles. Method: ERbeta2 nuclear speckles were identified by immunofluorescence in cell lines representing luminal A, luminal B, HER2+ and basal breast cancer. The effect of ER agonists/antagonists on speckle number/size was determined by immunofluorescence followed by image analysis. Speckles throughout the cell cycle were investigated using parallel immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Dual immunofluorescence with known nuclear speckle proteins was performed. Results: Speckles were present in all cell lines and their number/size varied. Speckle number but not size significantly increased in MCF-7 cells when stimulated with 50nM 4-OHT (p=0.02), 10nM DPN (p= 0.04) or 30 muM genistein (p=<0.0001), but not with 10nM E2 (p= 0.3). Speckle characteristics were not related to cell cycle, nor did they colocalise with coilin, PML nuclear bodies, nuclear speckles or paraspeckles. Conclusion: ERbeta2 nuclear speckles are dynamic structures consistently observed in cells across all molecular breast cancer subtypes. The antiproliferative treatments 4-OHT, DPN and genistein resulted in increased speckle number.

Simvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase which has been shown to possess 'in vitro' anti-CSC actions; the aim of this study was to investigate those actions 'in vivo'. Method: In this sense, mammary cancer was induced with Dimetilbenz-( a)-anthracene (DMBA) in female Sprague-Dawley rats and the animals were treated for 14 dayswith simvastatin (20 or 40mg/kg/day) or soybean oil. Results: At the highest dose, simvastatin substantially reduced tumor volume and expression of CSC markers. We observed an 80 % reduction in tumor growth which could not be explained solely by the decrease in CSCs, given that they accounted for less than 10 % of the neoplasia. Notably, normal stem cells were not affected by the treatment. We also showed that simvastatin significantly decreased proliferative activity but did not increase cell death in tumours. Conclusion: For the first time, we have demonstrated simvastatin anti- CSC actions 'in vivo', further demonstrating that these are not restricted to CSCs, but extensive to more mature neoplastic cells. Together, our data indicate that simvastatin might be a promising new candidate for the treatment of breast cancer.",NA,"*pathology *murine model *stem cell *breast cancer *society cancer stem cell competitive inhibition Sprague Dawley rat female tumor cell tumor volume tumor growth neoplasm cell death in vitro study *simvastatin *cell marker soybean oil hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase anthracene marker","S38","465","2014",-1

Tangyuenyongwatana","Molecular binding modes of diarylheptanoids from Curcuma comosa on the ER-beta receptor","Curcuma comosa Roxb. is a medicinal plant that belongs to the Zingiberaceae family. The plant has been used in traditional Thai medicine for the treatment of postpartum uterine bleeding. The major compounds found in this plant are diarylheptanoids, which are reported to have estrogenic activity. The aim of the study was to understand the three-dimensional (3-D) aspects of diarylheptanoids from C. comosa on ER-beta estrogenic receptor at the molecular level. The binding conformations of diarylheptanoid analogues with ER-beta receptor were obtained by the AutoDock 4.2 program using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) in conjunction with an empirical force field to calculate the complex binding free energy. From the analysis of docking results, diarylheptanoid analogues with higher activity have a hydroxyl group in ring C which can be modified by using the isosteres groups while the other phenyl ring have less polarity to fit into the hydrophobic pocket of the ER-beta receptor. In addition, the heptyl chain needs some flexibility to allow the phenyl ring to adjust suitably into the receptor-binding pocket. Molecular modeling using AutoDock 4.2 was effectively applied to understand the binding conformation of diarylheptanoid analogues with ER-beta receptor. Information of three-dimensional conformation can be applied in rational drug design for further searching the new highly activity ER-beta rec eptor agonists.",NA,"article binding affinity binding site controlled study crystal structure Curcuma Curcuma comosa hydrogen bond molecular docking nonhuman *protein binding protein interaction estradiol *estrogen receptor beta genistein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *heptane derivative/ec [Endogenous Compound]","82-89","38","2014",-1

Zhang","Discovery of novel aromatase inhibitors using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay","Aim: Aromatase is an important target for drugs to treat hormone-dependent diseases, including breast cancer. The aim of this study was to develop a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) aromatase assay suitable for high-throughput screening (HTS). Methods: A 384-well aromatase HTRF assay was established, and used to screen about 7000 compounds from a compound library. Anti-proliferation activity of the hit was evaluated using alamarBlue(R) assay in a hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line T47D. Molecular docking was conducted to elucidate the binding mode of the hit using the Discovery Studio program. Results: The Z' value and signal to background (S/B) ratio were 0.74 and 5.4, respectively. Among the 7000 compounds, 4 hits (XHN22, XHN26, XHN27 and triptoquinone A) were found to inhibit aromatase with IC50 values of 1.60+0.07, 2.76+0.24, 0.81+0.08 and 45.8+11.3 mumol /L, respectively. The hits XHN22, XHN26 and XHN27 shared the same chemical scaffold of 4-imidazolyl quinoline. Moreover, the most potent hit XHN27 at 10 and 50 mumol/L inhibited the proliferation of T47D cells by 45.3% and 35.2%, respectively. The docking study revealed that XHN27 docked within the active site of aromatase and might form a hydrogen bond and had a -cation interaction with amino acid residues of the protein. Conclusion: XHN27, an imidazolyl quinoline derivative of flavonoid, is a potent aromatase inhibitor with anti-proliferation activity against breast cancer in vitro. The established assay can be used in HTS for discovering novel aromatase inhibitor. 2014 CPS and SIMM.",NA,"article breast cancer cell line cell proliferation cell viability concentration response controlled study drug determination drug potency enzyme activity enzyme mechanism *fluorescence analysis high throughput screening *homogeneous time resolved fluorescence human human cell hydrogen bond IC 50 molecular docking protein interaction Tripterygium wilfordii amino acid *aromatase inhibitor/an [Drug Analysis] *aromatase inhibitor/cm [Drug Comparison] *aromatase inhibitor/dv [Drug Development] *aromatase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] biochanin A/cm [Drug Comparison] cation *flavone derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *flavone derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] *flavone derivative/dv [Drug Development] *flavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] letrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] quinoline derivative Tripterygium wilfordii extract/cm [Drug Comparison] unclassified drug *xhn 22/an [Drug Analysis] *xhn 22/dv [Drug Development] *xhn 22/pd [Pharmacology] *xhn 26/an [Drug Analysis] *xhn 26/dv [Drug Development] *xhn 26/pd [Pharmacology] *xhn 27/an [Drug Analysis] *xhn 27/cm [Drug Comparison] *xhn 27/dv [Drug Development] *xhn 27/pd [Pharmacology]","1082-1092","35","2014",-1

Bhat","Resveratrol inhibits estrogen-induced breast carcinogenesis through induction of NRF2-mediated protective pathways","The importance of estrogens in the etiology of breast cancer is widely recognized. Estrogeninduced oxidative stress has been implicated in this carcinogenic process. Resveratrol (Res), a natural antioxidant phytoestrogen has chemopreventive effects against a variety of illnesses including cancer. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mechanism(s) of Res-mediated protection against estrogen-induced breast carcinogenesis. Female ACI rats were treated with 17beta-estradiol (E2), Res, and Res+E2 for 8 months. Co-treatment of rats with Res and E2 inhibited E2-mediated proliferative changes in mammary tissues and significantly increased tumor latency and reduced E2-induced breast tumor development. Resveratrol treatment alone or in combination with E2 significantly upregulated expression of NRF2 in mammary tissues. Expression of NRF2-regulated antioxidant genes NQO1, SOD3, and OGG1 that is involved in protection against oxidative DNA damage was increased in Res- and Res+E2-treated mammary tissues. Resveratrol also prevented E2-mediated inhibition of detoxification genes AOX1 and FMO1. Inhibition of E2-mediated alterations in NRF2 promoter methylation and expression of NRF2 targeting miR-93 after Res treatment indicated Res-mediated epigenetic regulation of NRF2 during E2-induced breast carcinogenesis. Resveratrol treatment also induced apoptosis and inhibited E2-mediated increase in DNA damage in mammary tissues. Increased apoptosis, and decreased DNA damage, cell migration, colony and mammosphere formation in Res- and Res+E2-treated MCF-10A cells suggested a protective role of Res against E2-induced mammary carcinogenesis. siRNA-mediated silencing of NRF2 inhibited Res-mediated preventive effects on the colony and mammosphere formation.

Sarkar","Recent progress on nutraceutical research in prostate cancer","Recently, nutraceuticals have received increasing attention as the agents for cancer prevention and supplement with conventional therapy. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the US. Growing evidences from epidemiological studies, in vitro experimental studies, animal studies, and clinical trials have shown that nutraceuticals could be very useful for the prevention and treatment of PCa. Several nutraceuticals including isoflavone, indole-3-carbinol, 3,3'-diindolylmethane, lycopene, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and curcumin are known to downregulate the signal transductions in AR, Akt, NF-B, and other signal transduction pathways which are vital for the development of PCa and the progression of PCa from androgen-sensitive to castrate-resistant PCa. Therefore, nutraceutical treatment in combination with conventional therapeutics could achieve better treatment outcome in prostate cancer therapy. Interestingly, some nutraceuticals could regulate the function of cancer stem cell (CSC)-related miRNAs and associated molecules, leading to the inhibition of prostatic CSCs which are responsible for drug resistance, tumor progression, and recurrence of PCa. Hence, nutraceuticals may serve as powerful agents for the prevention of PCa progression and they could also be useful in combination with chemotherapeutics or radiotherapy. Such strategy could become a promising newer approach for the treatment of metastatic PCa with better treatment outcome by improving overall survival. 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.",NA,"antineoplastic activity antioxidant activity article cancer chemotherapy cancer growth cancer inhibition cancer prevention cancer radiotherapy cancer recurrence cancer resistance cancer risk cancer stem cell cancer therapy diet drug bioavailability drug dose escalation drug effect drug efficacy drug mechanism drug megadose drug potentiation drug safety drug tolerability human maximum plasma concentration maximum tolerated dose *medical research metastasis nonhuman overall survival phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phase 2 clinical trial (topic) priority journal *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] prostate tumor/si [Side Effect] randomized controlled trial (topic) risk reduction signal transduction testosterone blood level treatment outcome tumor growth unspecified side effect/si [Side Effect] vegetable 3 indolemethanol/cb [Drug Combination] 3 indolemethanol/pd [Pharmacology] 3,3' diindolylmethane/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] 3,3' diindolylmethane/ct [Clinical Trial] 3,3' diindolylmethane/cb [Drug Combination] 3,3' diindolylmethane/it [Drug Interaction] 3,3' diindolylmethane/dt [Drug Therapy] 3,3' diindolylmethane/pk [Pharmacokinetics] 3,3' diindolylmethane/pd [Pharmacology] androgen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] antineoplastic agent/cb [Drug Combination] antineoplastic agent/it [Drug Interaction] BioResponse DIM celecoxib/cb [Drug Combination] celecoxib/it [Drug Interaction] curcumin/ct [Clinical Trial] curcumin/cb [Drug Combination] curcumin/it [Drug Interaction] curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] docetaxel/cb [Drug Combination] docetaxel/it [Drug Interaction] doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] doxorubicin/it [Drug Interaction] epigallocatechin gallate/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] epigallocatechin gallate/ct [Clinical Trial] epigallocatechin gallate/cb [Drug Combination] epigallocatechin gallate/it [Drug Interaction] epigallocatechin gallate/dt [Drug Therapy] epigallocatechin gallate/pk [Pharmacokinetics] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] fish oil/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] genistein/it [Drug Interaction] genistein/po [Oral Drug Administration] genistein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] isoflavone/cb [Drug Combination] isoflavone/it [Drug Interaction] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/to [Drug Toxicity] isoflavone/pk [Pharmacokinetics] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] lycopene/ct [Clinical Trial] lycopene/cb [Drug Combination] lycopene/it [Drug Interaction] lycopene/dt [Drug Therapy] lycopene/pd [Pharmacology] microRNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *nutraceutical/dt [Drug Therapy] *nutraceutical/pd [Pharmacology] paclitaxel/cb [Drug Combination] paclitaxel/it [Drug Interaction] placebo polyphenon E prostaglandin synthase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] prostaglandin synthase inhibitor/it [Drug Interaction] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","629-640","33","2014",-1

However, its pharmacological activity remains unclear. In this study we evaluated the property of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of Larrea nitida extracts (LNE) as a phytoestrogen that can mimic, modulate or disrupt the actions of endogenous estrogens, depending on the tissue and relative amount of other SERMs. To investigate the property of SERM of LNE, we performed MCF-7 cell proliferation assays, estrogen response element (ERE)-luciferase reporter gene assay, human estrogen receptor (hER) binding assays and in vivo uterotrophic assay. To gain insight into the active principles, we performed a bioassay-guided analysis of LNE employing solvents of various polarities and using classical column chromatography, which yielded 16 fractions (LNs). LNE showed high binding affinities for hERalpha and hERbeta with IC50values of 1.20 x10-7 g/ml and 1.00x10-7 g/ml, respectively. LNE induced 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced MCF-7 cell proliferation, however, it reduced the proliferation in the presence of E2. Furthermore, LNE had an atrophic effect in the uterus of immature rats through reducing the expression level of progesterone receptor (PR) proteins. LN08 and LN10 had more potent affinities for binding on hER alpha and beta than other fractions. Our results indicate that LNE had higher binding affinities for hERbeta than hERalpha, and showed SERM properties in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and the rat uterus. LNE may be useful for the treatment of estrogen-related conditions, such as female cancers and menopause. 2014 The Korean Society of Applied Pharmacology.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue antiproliferative activity article atrophy binding affinity *bioassay *cell proliferation assay column chromatography controlled study drug dose comparison drug indication drug potency drug receptor binding drug selectivity estrogen responsive element female human human cell IC 50 immaturity in vitro study in vivo study Larrea Larrea nitida luciferase assay malignant neoplastic disease *mcf 7 cell line menopause nonhuman plant leaf plant stem protein expression rat transcription regulation *uterotrophic assay uterus atrophy uterus disease uterus weight weight gain estradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *Larrea nitida extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *Larrea nitida extract/do [Drug Dose] *Larrea nitida extract/pd [Pharmacology] *Larrea nitida extract/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] *plant extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *plant extract/do [Drug Dose] *plant extract/pd [Pharmacology] *plant extract/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] progesterone receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/cm [Drug Comparison] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/do [Drug Dose] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] unclassified drug","347-354","22","2014",-1

Becker","Effect of the amount and type of dietary fat on cardiometabolic risk factors and risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer: A systematic review","The effects of both the amount and quality of dietary fat have been studied intensively during the past decades. Previously, low-fat diets were recommended without much attention to the quality of fat, whereas there is general emphasis on the quality of fat in current guidelines. The objective of this systematic review (SR) was to assess the evidence of an effect of the amount and type of dietary fat on body weight (BW), risk factors, and risk of non-communicable diseases, that is, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and cancer in healthy subjects or subjects at risk for these diseases. This work was performed in the process of updating the fourth edition of the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations from 2004. The literature search was performed in October 2010 covering articles published since January 2000. A complementary search was done in February 2012 covering literature until December 2011. Two authors independently selected articles for inclusion from a total of about 16,000 abstracts according to predefined criteria. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and prospective cohort studies (PCS) were included as well as nested case-control studies. A few retrospective case-control studies were also included when limited or no data were available from other study types. Altogether 607 articles were quality graded and the observed effects in these papers were summarized. Convincing evidence was found that partial replacement of saturated fat (SFA) with polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) or monounsaturated fat (MUFA) lowers fasting serum/plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations. The evidence was probable for a decreasing effect of fish oil on concentration of serum/plasma total triglycerides as compared with MUFA. Beneficial effect of MUFA both on insulin sensitivity and fasting plasma/serum insulin concentration was considered as probable in comparisons of MUFA and carbohydrates versus SFA, whereas no effect was found on fasting glucose concentration in these comparisons. There was probable evidence for a moderate direct association between total fat intake and BW. Furthermore, there was convincing evidence that partial replacement of SFA with PUFA decreases the risk of CVD, especially in men. This finding was supported by an association with biomarkers of PUFA intake; the evidence of a beneficial effect of dietary total PUFA, n-6 PUFA, and linoleic acid (LA) on CVD mortality was limited suggestive. Evidence for a direct association between total fat intake and risk of T2DM was inconclusive, whereas there was limited-suggestive evidence from biomarker studies that LA is inversely associated with the risk of T2DM. However, there was limited-suggestive evidence in biomarker studies that odd-chain SFA found in milk fat and fish may be inversely related to T2DM, but these associations have not been supported by controlled studies. The evidence for an association between dietary n-3 PUFA and T2DM was inconclusive. Evidence for effects of fat on major types of cancer was inconclusive regarding both the amount and quality of dietary fat, except for prostate cancer where there was limited-suggestive evidence for an inverse association with intake of ALA and for ovarian cancer for which there was limited-suggestive evidence for a positive association with intake of SFA. This SR reviewed a large number of studies focusing on several different health outcomes. The time period covered by the search may not have allowed obtaining the full picture of the evidence in all areas covered by this SR. However, several SRs and meta-analyses that covered studies published before year 2000 were evaluated, which adds confidence to the results. Many of the investigated questions remain unresolved, mainly because of few studies on certain outcomes, conflicting results from studies, and lack of high quality-controlled studies. There is thus an evident need of highly controlled RCT and PCS with sufficient number of subjects and long enough duration, specifically regarding the effects of the amount and quality of dietary fat on insu in sensitivity, T2DM, low-grade inflammation, and blood pressure. New metabolic and other potential risk markers and utilization of new methodology in the area of lipid metabolism may provide new insight. 2014 Ursula Schwab et al.",NA,"arterial wall thickness bladder cancer/et [Etiology] blood pressure body composition body weight breast cancer/et [Etiology] *cancer risk *cardiometabolic risk *cardiovascular disease/et [Etiology] *cardiovascular risk cholesterol blood level colorectal cancer/et [Etiology] endometrium cancer/et [Etiology] esophagus cancer/et [Etiology] *fat intake glucose blood level human insulin sensitivity kidney cancer/et [Etiology] lipid composition lung cancer/et [Etiology] meta analysis (topic) *neoplasm/et [Etiology] *non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus/et [Etiology] ovary cancer/et [Etiology] pancreas cancer/et [Etiology] pregnancy outcome prostate cancer/et [Etiology] quality control randomized controlled trial (topic) review skin cancer/et [Etiology] stomach cancer/et [Etiology] systematic review thrombocyte aggregation triacylglycerol blood level carbohydrate/ec [Endogenous Compound] corn oil *fat fish oil gamma linolenic acid glucose/ec [Endogenous Compound] high density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] insulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] linoleic acid low density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] margarine monounsaturated fatty acid polyunsaturated fatty acid primrose oil saturated fatty acid soybean oil triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"58","2014",-1

Our aim was to observe the chronic effects of monosodium glutamate and aspartame on albino Wistar rats. Methods: Six male and six female control rats (age 6 weeks) were given water and standard poultry growers' mash. Six age and sexmatched groups (12 rats each) took the same diet with these additives at human acceptable daily dietary intake3: monosodium glutamate (MSG), aspartame (ASP), MSG + ASP, soya oil (OIL), MSG + OIL, MSG + ASP + OIL. Follow-up was for one year, with statistical significance (ANOVA, P < 0.05) as follows. Results: Mortality was higher in the test groups (17 adult and 86 infant deaths; controls: zero and three deaths). Fertility was higher in the control groups (103 births; test groups: 33-57 births per group). Liver enzymes and bilirubin rose markedly in the MSG and MSG + ASP groups. Rats on MSG, ASP, MSG + ASP exhibited a significant rise in serum urea and creatinine, more so than OIL groups. Liver histology showed mild portal inflammation in MSG rats at 9- 12 months. Renal histology showed periglomerular fibrosis in one MSG rat at 6 months, and interstitial nephritis in another at 12 months. Control rats had normal histology. Blood sugar rose significantly after a year in all test groups, except MSG. Serum uric acid was increased in all groups (except OIL). All biochemical changes were mainly at the later time-points, 6-12 months. Serum estradiol was reduced at 6 months in all groups (except MSG, OIL). Serum cholesterol rose in all test groups (except MSG + ASP). Blood pressure, rose significantly in all test groups. Prostatic specific antigen rose in the MSG + OIL group. Conclusions: Thus chronic dosing with glutamate or aspartame in rats led to fertility impairment, increased mortality, and significant changes in organ function tests and histology. Breeding rats to increase toxicogenetic effects, would further support the concept of genetically predisposed toxicity of MSG and ASP in chronic disease.",NA,"*low drug dose *albino *Wistar rat *clinical pharmacology *chronic toxicity rat histology fertility chronic disease mortality human diet agonist poultry interstitial nephritis glucose blood level observational study control group death child death adult female breeding male statistical significance urea blood level liver histology inflammation follow up fibrosis hypertension uric acid blood level estradiol blood level cholesterol blood level blood pressure function test toxicity *glutamate sodium *aspartame soybean oil water creatinine bilirubin liver enzyme glutamic acid prostate specific antigen","353","115","2014",-1

Zorina","Herb-drug interaction between cyclosporine and photochemical supplement in a kidney transplant recipients: Case report","Background: Drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP P450) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) play important role in the metabolism, elimination and detoxification of xenobiotics and drugs. It is known that cyclosporine (CSP), a potent immunosuppressant, is widely used in transplant patients. The absorption and disposition of CSP are associated with Pagp and cytochrome CYP3A4. CSP has a narrow therapeutic range so demands drug monitoring. However, we know that phytochemical supplements are also exposed transformation and can influence CYP P450 and P-gp. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), green tea catechins, is reported to be an inhibitor of both P-gp and CYP3A. Indol-3-carbinol (I3C), cruciferous vegetables, is reported as a strong inductor of CYP1A2, and less CYP1A1 and 3A4. Phytochemical combination of I3C, EGCG and soy is cancer chemoprevention and widely used for treatment proliferative diseases of reproductive system of women. Method and results: The patient is a 39 year-old woman with endstage of renal disease. She received a renal allotransplantation in 2002 because of IgA glomerulonephritis. Immunosuppressive therapy's been since 2002. At present she takes metylprednizolon 4 mg, cyclosporine 150 mg, mycophenolate mofetil 2000 mg a day. Now the patient has IgA nepropathy transplantant kidney, CNI-nephrotoxicity. Since 2007 the patient's had microgematuria, without albuminuria. Plasma creatinine 100 mkmol/l, urea 5.3 mmol/l, K 3.7 mM. Concentration of CSP in blood was 120 ng/ml (normal ratio 120-140 ng/ml). In 2013 the patient had uterine bleeding associated with endometrial hyperplasia uterus and she had undergone hysteroscopic endometrial ablation twice. She was banned to take levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems. The patient was recommended phytochemical supplement with I3C 200 mg, genistine\dsadzein 200 mg and EGCG 200 mg a day. After 2 weeks concentration of cyclosporine in bloo was 170 ng/ml. Urinary albumin was 2 g/l. Phytochemical supplement was stopped. 2 weeks later concentration of CSP was 110 ng/ml. Clinical and ultrasonography characteristics of endometrial hyperplasia uterus decreased. The patient didn't take other drugs and there was no change in immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion: We suppose that increase of concentration of CSP was caused by blocking P-gp by EGCG and inhibition CYP3A4 by I3C. The inhibition of P-gp leads to increase of concentration of CSP and increase of risk of side effects of CSP.",NA,"*herb drug interaction *kidney graft *graft recipient *human *case report *clinical pharmacology female patient uterus endometrium hyperplasia immunosuppressive treatment metabolism drug monitoring absorption kidney disease albuminuria diseases chemoprophylaxis transplantation vegetable neoplasm genital system allotransplantation immunoglobulin A nephropathy kidney nephrotoxicity creatinine blood level detoxification blood tea uterus bleeding endometrium ablation levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system echography risk side effect *cyclosporin plant medicinal product cytochrome P450 multidrug resistance protein cytochrome mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester immunoglobulin A epigallocatechin gallate immunosuppressive agent drug metabolizing enzyme methanol indole catechin xenobiotic agent urea albumin cyclosporin A","163","115","2014",-1

Priere","Molecular design strategy for enhanced estrogenic activity of diarylheptanoids using carborane cluster derivatization: Skeletal scaffold or bulky prosthetic appendage","Background: Diarylheptanoids (DAHs) are known to exhibit significant estrogen receptor (ER) activity and as such identified as candidates for safe and effective phytoestrogen replacement for conventional post-menopausal estrogen supplement. Significant numbers of breast cancer cases also depend on estrogen receptor agonist binding thereby worsening pre-existing cases. Downstream consequence of ligand binding to estrogen receptors not only depends on the affinity of the ligand to the receptors, but also to the steric effect of bound ligand on the conformation and spatial orientation of helix 12 of the estrogen receptor binding domain. Boron-containing clusters however are known to exhibit considerable chemical stability in addition to versatile physicochemical properties. Derivatisation of endocrine disruptors with carborane clusters e.g dicarba-closo-dodecaborane combining its hydrophobic and chemical properties with unique structural features will afford flexibility in the design of ER ligands for enhanced binding affinity coupled with and selective agonistic and antagonistic properties. We therefore investigated the possibility of employing carborane derivatives as either 'skeletal backbone' or prosthetic attachment in DAHs to achieve functional selectivity using in-silico molecular modeling and docking experiments. Methods: Carboranes derivatives of DAHs were generated using HyperChem, using Allow Ions option and geometry optimization with the semi-empirical AM1 method. The obtained geometries of the carborane derivatives were compared with those obtained from ab initio calculations at the Hatree-Fock/6-31G*level. Because HyperChem does not provide any platform for docking, and since Autodock does not provide parameters for boron atoms, all boron atoms are converted to carbon atoms after optimization and subsequently converted to pdbqt file that Autodock can handle. Docking was performed using Autodock vina and conformational poses of ligands are scored and compared. Results: As designed, it was found that depending on the in-silico molecular design of the carborane derivatives of DAHs, it was possible to fine-tune the properties of the resulting molecules to obtain desired agonistic or antagonistic action on the estrogen receptors. Conclusions: Carborane derivatives of DAHs improved the ligand efficiency on estrogen receptors and provides a possible strategy for design of highly efficient estrogen receptor ligands with either agonistic or antagonistic properties.",NA,"*derivatization *clinical pharmacology computer model geometry ligand binding agonist breast cancer physical chemistry receptor binding laryngeal mask binding affinity spatial orientation molecular model ab initio calculation parameters *heptane derivative estrogen receptor ligand carborane derivative boron phytoestrogen endocrine disruptor estrogen receptor ion carbon","132-133","115","2014",-1

Palabiyik","Gold nanoparticle conjugated lignan derivatives inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells","Background: In the last decade, phytoestrogen intake has considerable interest in relation to cancer prevention. Lignans are one of major structural classes of phytoestrogens as non-steroidal compounds. The anti-inflammatory and phytoestrogenic effects of lignans as well as their ability to inhibit proliferation render these compounds as important targets for cancer therapy. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been recently investigated for their interactions with cells since they are biocompatible materials. The aim of this study is to compare the antiproliferative effects of lignan derivatives, pinoresinol and lariciresinol with their AuNP-conjugated forms on breast carcinoma cells. Material and Methods: AuNPs were synthesized by a chemical reduction method. AuNP was modified with a linking agent-thiolated b-cyclodextrin to achieve conjugation of AuNP and lignans. The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (HTB-22) were treated with lignan derivatives lariciresinol and pinoresinol and their AuNP conjugated forms with concentrations ranging from 1x10-4M to 1x10-9M. The influence of lignan derivatives on MCF-7 cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay and the action of these compounds on cell proliferation was determined with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. Results: The AuNP conjugated forms of pinoresinol strongly inhibited the BrdU incorporation to the cells within the inhibition range was between 18.02% to 89.44% in descending sample concentration whereas it was 50.81% to 92.87% in free pinoresinol group. The inhibition of cell proliferation in AuNP conjugated lariciresinol group was also significantly higher than the free lariciresinol (p < 0.05). The cell viability was significantly decreased in both AuNP conjugated lignan groups as the results were 33.24% and 43.05%, respectively at 1x10-4M dose. Conclusions: According to these data, AuNP conjugated lignan samples showed strong anti-proliferative effects on MCF-7 cells when compared to free lignan derivatives.

The natural product genistein, found in high amounts in soy products, has been implicated in preventing PCa formation and metastasis in men who consume high amounts of soy. In vitro studies and in vivo rodent models that used human PCa cells, as well as prospective human clinical trials, provide a mechanistic explanation directly supporting genistein as an antimetastatic agent. Specifically, our group showed that genistein inhibits cell detachment, protease production, cell invasion, and human PCa metastasis at concentrations achieved in humans with dietary intake. Finally, phase I and phase II clinical trials conducted by us and others showed that concentrations of genistein associated with antimetastatic efficacy in preclinical models are achievable in humans, and treatment with genistein inhibits pathways that regulate metastatic transformation in human prostate tissue. 2014 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"*cancer inhibition cancer mortality cancer prognosis *cell adhesion *cell invasion conference paper double blind procedure drug clearance drug efficacy drug metabolism epithelial mesenchymal transition extracellular matrix human in vitro study in vivo study *metastasis nonhuman phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phase 2 clinical trial (topic) prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer cell line protein phosphorylation randomized controlled trial (topic) activin receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] endoglin/ec [Endogenous Compound] gelatinase A/ec [Endogenous Compound] gelatinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] heat shock protein 27/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase p38/ec [Endogenous Compound] placebo prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] Smad3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] transforming growth factor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]","431S-436S","100","2014",-1

Matyja","Secretory meningiomas: Immunohistochemical pattern of lectins and ultrastructure of pseudopsammoma bodies","Secretory meningioma is an infrequent histological subtype of benign, WHO grade I meningioma, that is characterized by focal epithelial and secretory transformation of meningothelial cells. The leading histopathological feature of neoplastic tissue is the presence of eosinophilic hyaline inclusions, defined as ""pseudopsammoma bodies"". These inclusions are mostly intracytoplasmic, different in size and often multiple. They are stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and are immunopositive for epithelial and secretory markers. The aim of this study was to determine the pattern of lectin bindings and ultrastructural features of secretory meningiomas. The examination was performed on 8 cases of secretory meningiomas that occurred in women and were mostly associated with prominent peritumoural oedema. Histologically, the tumours exhibited numerous eosinophilic, PAS positive pseudopsammoma bodies. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a strong, ring-like cytokeratin expression around the pseudopsammoma bodies. The inclusions were CEA and EMA positive but negative for vimentin. The immunolabeling with four lectins (PNA, SBA, Con A and DBA) was studied. The majority of pseudopsammoma bodies and surrounding tumour cells were strongly labelled with PNA and SBA. Immunolabelling with Con A showed irregular staining with high intensity in small inclusions. Immunostaining with DBA was seldom positive in inclusions and negative in the tumour cell cytoplasm. Ultrastructure of pseudopsammoma bodies exhibited advanced heterogeneity. The size of inclusions and the content of intracytoplasmic lumina varied greatly. Some pseudopsammoma bodies seemed to be located extracellularly and lacked the obvious lumina. Our ultrastructural study and lectin binding pattern support the unique epithelial and secretory transformation of neoplastic cells connected with their altered glycosylation.",NA,"adult aged antibody labeling article *cell ultrastructure clinical article cytoplasm desmosome electron microscopy endoplasmic reticulum eosinophilia female Golgi complex human human tissue *immunohistochemistry immunoreactivity *lectin binding site *meningioma microvillus middle aged periodic acid Schiff stain *psammoma body *pseudopsammoma body *secretory meningioma tonofilament tumor cell agglutinin carcinoembryonic antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] concanavalin A cytokeratin AE1/ec [Endogenous Compound] dolichos biflorus agglutinin epithelial membrane antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *lectin peanut agglutinin soybean agglutinin unclassified drug vimentin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","141-150","52","2014",-1

Omega-3-fatty acids (O3-FAs) have anti-inflammatory effects and can be effective in decreasing arthralgias from rheumatologic conditions. Omega-3 fatty acids are used by 25% of breast cancer survivors. Methods: Women with early-stage breast cancer, taking an AI for >90 days and who had a worst pain/stiffness score of >5 of 10 using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-WP) were randomized to receive either 3.3 grams of O3-FAs or placebo (soybean/corn oil) daily for 12 weeks. Subjects completed quality of life (FACT-ES) and pain assessment (WOMAC, M-SACRAH) at baseline, weeks 6, 12 and 24. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the difference in BPI-WP (primary outcome) between the two groups. Clinically significant change was defined as >2-point drop from baseline. Results: Among 262 patients registered, 249 were considered evaluable with 122 women in the O3-FA arm and 127 in the placebo arm. No notable imbalances by arm were observed. Baseline BPI-WP was 6.98 and 7.09 in the O3-FA and placebo groups respectively. The mean observed BPI-WP score decreased by 1.74 points at 12 weeks compared to baseline with omega-3, decreased by1.50 points with placebo and decreased further by 24 weeks (2.22 & 1.81 points, respectively) despite discontinuation at 12 weeks. In a linear regression adjusting for the baseline score, osteoarthritis and taxane use, adjusted 12-week BPI-WP scores were similar in both arms (p=0.58). The proportion of patients with a > 2-point drop in 12 week BPI -WP was 61% on Omega-3 and 57% on Placebo, p=.44. O3-FAs resulted in increased grade >1 diarrhea (15 vs 6 patients). Serial fasting blood is being analyzed for cholesterol and inflammatory markers. Conclusions: We found a substantial (60%) and sustained improvement of AI arthralgias with both the omega-3 and placebo, but found no meaningful difference between the groups.

Ward","Flaxseed, alone or combined with low-dose estrogen therapy has no adverse effect on uterus health in ovariectomized rats","Background: The risk of adverse events associated with the use of standard-dose hormone therapy (conjugated equine estrogen + medroxyprogesterone acetate) may be reduced by using low-dose transdermal estrogen monotherapy (LD). Thus, LD may be appropriate for use by postmenopausal women with an intact uterus. Previously, we showed using ovariectomized (OVX) rats that flaxseed (FS), rich in phytoestrogen lignan and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, protects against bone loss and deterioration of bone microarchitecture and strength at the lumbar vertebrae when combined with LD compared to either treatment alone. However, their combined effects on uterine tissue are unknown. Objective: To determine the effects of FS combined with LD on markers of uterine health in OVX rats. Study Design: 3 weeks following ovariectomy or SHAM surgery, 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (OVX, n=48; SHAM, n=12) were randomized to: 1) SHAM, 2) OVX, 3) OVX+FS, 4) OVX+LD or 5) OVX+FS+LD. Ground FS was added to the AIN-93M diet (100g/kg diet), and LD was delivered using a subcutaneous implant to deliver 0.42 mug 17beta-estradiol /kg body weight per day, mimicking LD in postmenopausal women. After 12 weeks, uterus wet weight was determined and histological analyses of the luminal epithelium were performed to determine morphological characteristics and cell proliferation. Results: As expected, SHAM had a significantly higher relative uterus weight (p<0.001) compared to all other groups. However, no significant differences in uterus weight were observed among OVX groups. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that luminal epithelia in the OVX group were flattened or cuboidal cells organized in a single layer while FS, LD and FS+LD treatments resulted in a single layer of elongated luminal epithelia that were columnar in shape. SHAM resulted in higher cell proliferation (p<0.05) of the luminal epithelium compared to the OVX, FS, LD and FS+LD groups. No other differences in cell proliferation were observed. Conclusion: FS, alone and in combination with LD, does not affect uterine weight and cell proliferation at the luminal epithelium in the OVX rat model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The observation that FS, alone and combined with LD, induces a small estrogen-like effect on the morphology of the luminal epithelium which is lower in magnitude to SHAM, suggests that FS both alone and combined with LD are not significant modulators of uterine carcinoma risk in this OVX rat model.",NA,"*linseed *low drug dose *estrogen therapy *adverse drug reaction *uterus *health *rat *society *bone epithelium cell proliferation uterus weight female risk postmenopause rat model human diet body weight implant monotherapy Sprague Dawley rat surgery ovariectomy transdermal drug administration study design uterus carcinoma tissues lumbar vertebra postmenopause osteoporosis deterioration weight osteolysis qualitative analysis morphological trait morphology hormonal therapy *mineral estrogen estradiol medroxyprogesterone acetate marker conjugated estrogen omega 3 fatty acid lignan phytoestrogen",NA,"26","2011",-1

Merr. as a treatment option for vaginal atrophy, on the morphology and expression of estrogen receptors in vaginal epithelium of postmenopausal women. Methods The double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Sixty women were treated for 12 weeks with isoflavone vaginal gel 4% (1 g/day) and a placebo gel. After 4 and 12 weeks, the vaginal atrophy symptoms were classified at none, mild, moderate and severe and the vaginal cytology were taken to determine the maturation value. Vaginal pH was measured at the beginning and end of therapy. Microbiopsies in vaginal fornix were performed before the treatment and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results Isoflavone vaginal gel was effective for relief of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia symptons and an increase in the intermediate and superficial cells was noted. The vaginal pH in the isoflavone group was 7.1 at baseline and 5.4 after 12 weeks, whereas in the placebo group there was no significant change. A significant increase in thickness after treatment was detected in the Isoflavone Group. The percentage of estrogen receptor positive cells in vaginal epithelium for the Isoflavone Group ranged from 58.5% at the beginning of treatment to 82.6% after 12 weeks. These results were superior to placebo gel. Conclusion Glycine max (L.) Merr. at 4% vaginal gel on a daily basis in postmenopausal women led to improvements in vaginal atrophy symptoms, maturation values, vaginal pH, morphology and expression of estrogen receptors in vaginal epithelium.

Some epidemiologic studies have shown that predominant android body fat distribution can have an effect on breast cancer incidence, associated with higher conversion of androstendione to estrone in peripheral adipose tissue. Aim: The study was focused on the efficacy of weight reduction therapy, based on low caloric, antioxidant - rich products and its influence on sex hormone metabolism and reduction of the risk of breast cancer in woman with metabolic syndrome. Methods: Investigated group consisted of 80 overweight women with metabolic syndrome, aged 45 + 8 years (BMI > 27,0 kg/m2).

The energy, nutritive value and level of antioxidants in daily food rations were analyzed using the Wikt Pro computer program. Anthropometrical parameters (BMI, WHR) and body composition (Bioelectrical impedance analysis BIA) were evaluated. Estrogen metabolites, 2OHE and 16alpha-OHE, were determined from 24 urine samples by ELISA method. The EMR (2:16OHE1) index was calculated. Results: Nutritional value of diets was adequate to composition of proper weight reduction diet. The nutritional intervention significantly changed endogenous estrogens level (p < 0,01). Concentration of cancer promoting estrogen (16alpha-OHE1) decreased and blood level of the carcinogenesis inhibiting metabolite (2-OHE) increase was observed. Simultaneously the study also indicated a significant increase of estrogen index (EMR 2:16OHE1).

Patients and Methods: * MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Library databases were searched. * We identified RCTs investigating soy/soy isoflavones as dietary supplements or dietary components for the secondary prevention or treatment of PCa in men with PCa or with a clinically identified risk of developing PCa.

The aim of this in vitro study was to examine the factors influencing the potency of styrene maleic acid (SMA-Dox) micelles loaded with doxorubicin in a range of 4.4% to 28.4% using breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines. A significant difference in cytotoxicity relative to micelle loading was observed and correlated with the expression level of caveolin-1. The expression level of caveolin-1 has previously been associated with advanced, aggressive cancer subtypes. For example, SMA-Dox micelles were shown to co-localize with caveolin-1 in PC3 cells and this colocalization was disrupted by treatment with the caveolin-1 inhibitor, genistein. The results of this study are indicative that the micelle loading and cellular expression of caveolin-1 modulates the relative cytotoxicity of nanoconstructs of different loading against breast and prostate cancer cell lines in vitro.

Epidemiological and animal data suggest that dietary intervention with soy-containing foods may prevent occurrence of certain types of cancers, like breast and colon, in which alcohol is also a well-established risk factor. In this study, DEN-treated male mice were assigned to 5 groups: a 35%high fat ethanol (EtOH) liquid diet (EtOH/cas) and corresponding high fat pair-fed diet (PF/cas) using casein as sole source protein, and a high fat EtOH liquid diet (EtOH/soy) and high fat PF diet (PF/soy) using soy protein isolate as sole source protein and a chow+DEN group. EtOH feeding, final concentration 5%(v/v), continued for 16 wks. As expected, EtOH increased the total number of tumor foci present in the livers of the EtOH/cas group compared to the PF/cas group and the chow+DEN group, p<0.05. Soy protein substitution in the high fat PF diet significantly decreased total tumor number in the PF/soy group compared to PF/cas group. These findings corresponded to reductions in serum ALT concentrations, and decreased hepatic TNFa, CXCl-2 and CD-14 expression in the PF/soy group compared to the PF/cas group, p<0.05. Tumor multiplicity and adenoma incidence were also reduced in the EtOH/soy group compared to the EtOH/cas group, p<0.05. Detection of sphingolipids using high resolution MALDI-FTICR Imaging mass spectrometry revealed increased accumulation of long acyl chain ceramide species, sphingosine-1 phosphate, and glucosylceramide in the EtOH/cas group that were significantly reduced in the EtOH/soy group. Previously, we have shown that chronic EtOH feeding activates Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways to promote tumorigenesis. In the present study,mRNA expression of b-catenin targets, including cyclin D1, MMP7 and glutamine synthetase, were reduced in the EtOH/soy group compared to the EtOH/cas group, p<0.05. These findings suggest that soy prevents tumorigenesis by reducing pro-inflammatory signaling primarily resulting from high fat induced hepatic injury, and by reducing hepatocyte proliferation through inhibition of EtOH-mediated b-catenin signaling. Moreover, these mechanisms may involve sphingolipid signaling.

However, clinical trials on the use of equol have not yet been published. This study aimed to investigate the effects of equol on bone metabolism, as well as on serum sex and thyroid hormone levels, in postmenopausal Japanese women. Methods: We performed a 1-year double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial using natural S-equol supplementation in 93 equol non-producing postmenopausal Japanese women at less than 5 years after the onset of menopause. Subjects aged 41-62 years were randomly assigned to the following 4 groups: placebo, 2 mg of S-equol (EQ-2), 6 mg of S-equol (EQ-6), and 10 mg of S-equol (EQ-10); subjects were required to take the supplements once per day. Results: The mean body weight and height of the subjects were 54.1 + 8.2 kg and 156.8 + 4.9 cm, respectively. There were no major differences in body weight and height among the different groups at baseline and after 12 months of equol intervention. Equol intervention increased the concentration of equol in the serum and urine of subjects in a dose-dependent manner. After 12 months of the intervention, urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) level significantly decreased to -23.94% in the EQ-10 group compared with that in the placebo group (-2.87%) (p = 0.020). This showed that 10 mg per day of equol supplementation markedly inhibited bone resorption. Additionally, the percent change in the whole body bone mineral density (BMD) in the EQ-10 group was -1.10%, which was significantly different from that in the placebo group (1.88%) (p = 0.027). Thus, a 12-month supplementation of 10 mg per day of equol prevented the decrease in the whole body BMD in postmenopausal women. Serum sex and thyroid hormone concentrations did not differ among the 4 groups after the equol intervention. Conclusions: This is the first report providing specific evidence of the effect of equol on bone metabolismin humans. The findings of this study suggest that supplementation of 10 mg of equol per day may contribute to the amelioration of bone health in equol non-producing postmenopausal women without causing any adverse effects.

Concepts related to the genesis of cancers include: (a) The Multi-Stage, Multi-Mechanism concept of carcinogenesis [6]; (b) the evolution of earth's physical environment ultimately allowed the appearance of anaerobic microbiological life forms that metabolized via glycolysis [7]; (b) the evolution of photosynthetic algae led to the oxygenation of the environment and to proto-eukaryotes after the symbiotic marriage of bacteria that could produce energy via oxidative phosphorylation; (d) the Warburg metabolism of cancers [8]; (e) the concept of ""cancer stem cells"" and ""cancer non-stem cells""[9]; and (f) the Barker hypothesis (diseases later in life might be the result of in utero embryonic/ fetal exposures to a variety of factors [10]). To prevent and treat cancer, one must understand the complex mechanism of the multi-stage, multimechanism process of human carcinogenesis [11]. Starting with the initiation step of transforming a normal cell to one that is unable to terminally differentiate, and the ""promotion"" phase which comes about by the clonal expansion of this single initiated cell. Promotion is brought about the reversible inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication, caused by growth factors, inflammatory stimulation, compensatory hyperplasia, due to chronic irritation or cell death, and by the ability to resist apoptotic death. A single cell can, then, accrue enough genotypic and epigenetic alterations to acquire all the ""hallmarks"" [12] of an invasive and metastatic cancer cell (the ""progression"" phase). Two important questions arise from this concept of the initiation/promotion/progression process of carcinogenesis, namely; ""What is the cell that is the target cell for 'initiation'?"", and ""What are the underlying molecular mechanisms for each phase of carcinogenesis?"" With the discovery of cancer- initiating cells within a tumor, the concept of ""cancer stem cells"" has been generated. Implicit in this concept is the idea that each tumor is a heterogeneous mixture of ""cancer non-stem cells"" and ""cancer stem cells"". The current paradigm is based on the assumption that a somatic mortal, differentiated cell can be de-differentiated or re-programmed to become immortal, allowing it to survive long enough to accrue additional mutations and epigenetic changes to become neoplastically-transformed. This paradigm is supported by observations in the stem cell field, where ""induced pluripotent stem cells"" (""iPS"") can be isolated from primary in vitro cultures with various cocktails of embryonic ""stemness"" genes [13]. However, there is an alterative interpretation of the origin of these ""iPS"" cells, namely, they were selected adult stem cells in those primary cultures [9]. In addition, the isolation of ""MUSE"" cells from normal human skin has demonstrated that these rare cells in the skin are the ""target cells"" for the so-called ""iPS"" cells [14]. Normal human adult stem cells are naturally ""immortal"" until they are induced to terminally differentiate. Adult stem cells can be inhibited from ""mortalizing"" or to remain ""immortal"" [15]. Dramatic demonstration has shown that only normal human breast stem cells could be efficiently blocked from ""mortalization"" and then neoplastically-transformed. This observation strongly supports the stem cell hypothesis [16,17]. Individual genetic, gender, dietary, environmental, life style, medical, lifespan and cultural factors can affect each of these three phases of carcinogenesis [18-21]. Genetic predispositions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, leading to UV-induced skin cancer and the experimental carcinogenesis studies and epidemiological findings that clearly show how diets, environmental chemicals (asbestos), drugs (DES; estrogens), life style factors (alcohol; cigarette smoking) can enhance the risk to various cancers. What is sometimes ignored are cultural factors, such as postponement of childbearing (early child bearing is a cancer ri k reducer). Other cultural factors, e.g., reduced exercise and dramatically altered diets and nutrition, have been associated with an increased caloric intake and non-nutritional diets of processed foods. A collision of biological evolutionary with cultural evolution is occurring. This allows for increased caloric intake, change in eating habits, types of foods, and even the relationship of the biological evolutional symbiotic role of our gut microbiota to our gut biology [22]. This collision has been more pronounced with caloric over-abundance, dramatically less physical exercise, the eating of processed foods and less of the early human diet-related foods, more grilled red meat, eating at all hours of the day, the changing of our gut microbiota and dieting with supplements. Clearly, biological evolution does not work fast enough to keep up with cultural evolutionary changes that affect our diet and other life style changes (postponing marriage; living longer). While all those factors can influence any of the phases of the carcinogenic process, initiation can never be reduced to a zero risk. Every time any cell replicates, there is always a finite chance of a mutation/initiation event to occur. The longer we live, the more initiated cells we accumulate. Except for teratomas, and early childhood cancers, most adult cancers take decades for the promotion process to expand the numbers of initiated cells for more mutational and epigenetic events to occur. Therefore, the promotion phase is the most efficacious period to intervene to prevent many cancers associated with environmental, dietary, life style, exercise and other cultural factors. One of the newer concepts that might also influence our understanding of risk factors to cancers is the ""Barker hypothesis"". Indirect experimental studies, as well as epidemiological studies, suggest that modulation (increased or decreased) of organ-specific adult stem cells could increase or decrease the risks to organ-specific cancers later in life ( e.g., DES-exposed female fetuses led to vaginal cancers in young women; soy- and caloric- restricted female fetuses of Japanese women have been associated with low breast cancer frequencies of woman later in life) [22]. Two factors could reduce the risks to various cancers, namely, modulating stem cell numbers in utero by careful exposures to environmental/life style and nutritional factors (decrease the target size of 'initiation' step) and post-natally, by interfering with the ""promotion"" of initiated cells by those same factors.",NA,"*energy metabolism *stem cell *cancer stem cell *hypothesis *school *oncology neoplasm human female carcinogenesis diet adult stem cell cultural factor risk food lifestyle normal human exercise target cell caloric intake pregnancy exposure intestine flora environment fetus eating skin marriage hyperplasia alga vagina cancer lifespan primary culture cell communication in vitro study red meat pluripotent stem cell mutation oxygenation evolution teratoma gene adult experimental study Japanese (people) breast gender eukaryote stimulation implantable cardioverter defibrillator eating habit cultural anthropology diseases X ray bone densitometer smoking metabolism glycolysis cancer risk oxidative phosphorylation nutrition skin cancer intestine cancer cell xeroderma pigmentosum lifestyle modification metastasis childhood cancer risk factor genetic predisposition modulation death cell death bacterium breast cancer cell count growth factor alcohol estrogen environmental chemical asbestos",NA,"7","2013",-1

Vollmer","A diet enriched by soy-derived isoflavones impacts on the development of premalignant stages of breast cancer in an estrogen driven carcinogenesis animal model","Background: Hundred thousands of mainly postmenopausal women are using dietary supplements enriched with soy-derived isoflavones (sISO), such as the Novasoy extract, to relief from climacteric complaints. At the same time, hundreds of studies controversially discuss the impact of sISO on the development of breast cancer. Whether sISO positively or negatively affect the tumorigenesis of the mammary gland presumably is dependent on the time point of the sISO exposure. An exposure during gestation, lactation as well as prepubertal is believed to be preventive whereas an exposure later in life might be adverse. Objective: Aim of the study was to assess whether and how sISO influence the development of breast cancer. Therefore, August-Copenhagen-Irish (ACI) rats, a model for estrogen driven carcinogenesis, were exposed towards sISO. Dietary exposure was started preconceptional and maintained in offspring animals continuously throughout the whole individual life. Experimentals: All ACI rats were kept under controlled conditions and had ad libitum access either to a sISO-free control diet or a diet supplemented with 500ppm of the Novasoy650 extract. Pregnant females were kept under the established dietary regimen throughout gestation and lactation period and the female offspring was investigated in the following experimental procedures. On postnatal day 60 (PND60) the animals of each dietary group randomly were implanted a 17beta-estradiol (E2) releasing (approximately 2mg release in 90 days) or a placebo pellet to induce tumorigenesis of the mammary gland. The rats were weekly palpated for mammary tumors and weighed weekly for the duration of the experiment (until PND240). Finally, we assessed physiological (e.g. organ weights, sISO exposition, mammary gland areas), (patho-)histological (HE staining), immunohistological (PCNA expression) as well as molecular end points (gene expression) of the resulting mammary gland phenotypes. Results: Control diet animals had a daily sISO exposure of 0.5mg/kg body weight, whereas animals of the Novasoy650 group had a daily exposure of 30mg/kg body weight. Independent of the dietary background, none of the animals with an implanted placebo pellet showed tumor precursors. Ductual carcinomas in situ (DCIS) were detected in 83.3% of the animals of the control diet and in 100% of the animals of the Novasoy650 diet, both following implantation of an E2-release pellet. Moreover, control diet animals exposed to E2 had significantly reduced mammary gland areas compared to the respective placebo group. This difference was not detectable in the Novasoy650 dietary group. Additionally, no differences in the uterus as well as liver wet weights were noticed. On a molecular level, the expression of several genes responsible for proliferation (Ki67), estrogenicity (Tff1) and cell cycle control (Cdk4) were modified in animals lifelong exposed towards sISO. Conclusions: In ACI rats, a prenatally started and lifelong maintained sISO exposure clearly affects the estradiol induced malignant transformation of the mammary gland. This is evidenced by a higher number of DCIS as well as increased proliferation levels which were found in animals chronically exposed to sISO.",NA,"*breast cancer *carcinogenesis *animal model *diet exposure mammary gland female August Copenhagen Irish rat body weight lactation pregnancy progeny rat postmenopause human malignant transformation cell cycle regulation model procedures weight liver uterus implantation carcinoma precursor neoplasm phenotype gene expression staining menopausal syndrome organ weight breast tumor diet supplementation gene intraductal carcinoma *estrogen *isoflavone derivative placebo estradiol",NA,"73","2013",1

Macejova","Extract ERr731 does not mimic estrogen stimulated growth of MNU-induced breast cancer in ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats","Background: ERr731 (trade names Phyto-Strol or femi-loges), an extract isolated from the roots of the Siberian rhubarb (Rheum rhaponticum), is used as an alternative treatment option for menopausal complaints. In addition, it is regularly used for the treatment of oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhea. The efficacy of the extract on treatment of menopausal complaints was shown in clinical trials and follow-up studies. Although clinical trials did not show changes of mammographic density, we addressed the question whether ERr731 is capable to stimulate experimental breast cancer in an estrogen dependent manner. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess whether or not the special extract ERr731 in a dosage relevant to human applications is capable to stimulate the growth of methyl-nitroso-urea (MNU) induced experimental breast cancer in ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Experimentals: 32 female SD rats were obtained at the age of postnatal day (PND) 40. On PND 49 and 56 all animals received an intra peritoneal MNU injection of 50 mg/kg body weight (BW). 28 days after the second injection 24 animals were ovariectomized (OvEx) and randomly allocated to 3 experimental groups, 8 animals were SHAM operated and served as positive control. SHAM operated animals (first positive control) and one group of OvEX animals (negative control) were fed a (phyto)estrogen-free diet. A second positive control group of OvEx animals received the phytoestrogen-free diet supplemented with 10 mg/kg diet of estradiol-benzoate. To mimic human exposure, ERr731, in a dose of 0.067 mg/kg BW/d was chosen which is equivalent to 2.5 mg of the extract/kg chow. The experiment was terminated 25 weeks after MNU injection. Tumor-specific parameters, as well as uterine wet weights (UWW) were assessed. Results: Ovariectomy reduced the UWW > 6fold. Estradiol-benzoate restored UWW almost completely, whereas ERr731 did not lead to an increase in UWW. Tumor incidence in estrogenized animals was 62.5% (5/8 animals) in the SHAM group and 50% (4/8 animals) in the estradiol-benzoate treated group. No tumors were detected in OvEx negative controls and OvEx animals supplemented with the human relevant dose of ERr731. The total numbers of tumors were 17 in the group of SHAM operated animals and 5 in the estradiol-benzoate treatment group. Conclusions: The human dose of ERr731 did neither exhibit estrogenic properties in the uterotrophic assay nor did it stimulate growth of MNU-induced breast cancers in OvEx SD rats, whereas estradiol supplementation at a low dose as well as estradiol levels in animals with a regular estrus cycle significantly promoted tumor growth. In this experimental model the used human dosage of ERr731 therefore appears safe regarding estrogen dependent growth stimulation of experimental MNU breast cancers.",NA,"*breast cancer *imaging software *Sprague Dawley rat human female injection diet neoplasm experimental mammary neoplasm clinical trial (topic) cancer incidence supplementation ovariectomy weight uterus density Rheum rhubarb exposure follow up parameters control group body weight oligomenorrhea assay experimental model tumor growth estrus cycle low drug dose amenorrhea growth stimulation *estrogen estradiol benzoate estradiol urea phytoestrogen",NA,"73","2013",-1

Tekmal","Plant-derived estrogen receptorb agonists alone or in combination with aromatase inhibitors restore sensitivity in endocrine therapy resistant breast tumors","Estrogen receptors (ER) play an important role in breast cancer. Over two-thirds of all breast cancers express ERa, and current endocrine therapies target its signaling. Antiestrogens (AE) block the binding of estrogen to ERalpha, while aromatase inhibitors (AI) inhibit local and systemic estrogen production. Both treatments improve outcomes for about 50% of patients with early or advanced ERalpha positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, therapeutic resistance frequently arises. There is a critical need to develop effective alternate strategies to prevent or delay the development of resistance to endocrine therapy and the resulting tumor progression. Both normal and tumor tissue express ERbeta which has anti-proliferative activity and recent studies have identified several natural compounds that have the potential to function as ERbeta agonists. Plant-derived ERbeta-agonists, Liquiritigenin (Liq), from the plant Glycyrrhizae uralensis and S-equol, from the soy isoflavone daidzein, are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of vasomotor hot flashes associated with menopause. In this study we sought to determine if ERbeta agonists alone or in combination with AI could resensitize Letrozole-resistant breast cancer cells in vivo. Xenografts were established using cells which model post-menopausal breast cancer. Endocrine therapy sensitive (MCF-7aro) and Letrozole resistant (LTLT-Ca) tumors were treated with either ERbeta agonists or in combination with AI and progression was measured. In MCF-7aro tumors, ERbeta agonist treatment reduced tumor volume and prolonged sensitivity to AI. In the therapy resistant tumors (LTLT-Ca), ERbeta agonist treatment blocked tumor growth and restored sensitivity to AI therapy. To determine the molecular mechanism by which ERbeta agonists inhibit tumor growth and prolong and restore sensitivity, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis was performed. Our results show changes in the levels of p53, NFkB, cyclin D1, and KLF5 in addition to other genes. To determine the role of ERbeta agonists on the activation of these genes specific gene promoter-luciferase reporter constructs were used and the specificity of ERbeta-mediated actions was confirmed using a siRNA approach. This study suggests that ERbeta acts as a tumor suppressor by suppressing cell growth through the inhibition of cell cycle genes and by inducing apoptosis through the regulation of p53. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential role for ERbeta agonists to improve adjuvant endocrine therapy to treat both hormone-responsive and hormone-resistant breast cancers.",NA,"*agonist *hormonal therapy *breast tumor *breast cancer *plant neoplasm tumor growth gene therapy female implantable cardioverter defibrillator patient human xenograft Western blotting cancer cell estrogen synthesis hot flush clinical trial (topic) menopause model tumor volume cell growth antiproliferative activity promoter region tissues cell cycle apoptosis *estrogen *aromatase inhibitor letrozole hormone protein p53 cycline daidzein isoflavone estrogen receptor equol liquiritigenin adjuvant natural product small interfering RNA luciferase",NA,"73","2013",-1

In this work, an efficient strategy for the synthesis of novel homoisoflavonoids, [1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]chromen-8-ones, was developed and all compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities on three breast cancer cell lines. Methods. Our synthetic route started from benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-ol which was reacted with 3-bromopropanoic acid followed by the reaction of oxalyl chloride to afford 6,7-dihydro-8H-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]chromen-8-one. The aldol condensation of the later compound with aromatic aldehydes led to the formation of the title compounds. Five novel derivatives 4a-e were tested for their cytotoxic activity against three human breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 using the MTT assay. Results: Among the synthesized compounds, 7-benzylidene-6,7-dihydro-8H-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]chromen-8-one (4a) exhibited the highest activity against three cell lines. Also the analysis of acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining results revealed that 7-benzylidene-6,7-dihydro-8H-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]chromen-8-one (4a) and 7-(2-methoxybenzylidene)-6,7-dihydro-8H-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]chromen-8-one (4b) induced apoptosis in T47D cell line. Conclusion: Finally, the effect of methoxy group on the cytotoxicity of compounds 4b-4d was investigated in and it was revealed that it did not improve the activity of [1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]chromen-8- ones against MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231. 2014 Alipour et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"aldol reaction article breast cancer cell line concentration response controlled study drug activity *drug cytotoxicity *drug synthesis human human cell human cell culture IC 50 in vitro study mcf 7 cell line MTT assay staining 7 (2 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/cm [Drug Comparison] 7 (2 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/dv [Drug Development] 7 (2 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/pd [Pharmacology] 7 (3 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/cm [Drug Comparison] 7 (3 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/dv [Drug Development] 7 (3 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/pd [Pharmacology] 7 (4 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/cm [Drug Comparison] 7 (4 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/dv [Drug Development] 7 (4 methoxybenzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/pd [Pharmacology] 7 (benzo[d][1,3]dioxol 5 ylmethylene) 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/cm [Drug Comparison] 7 (benzo[d][1,3]dioxol 5 ylmethylene) 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/dv [Drug Development] 7 (benzo[d][1,3]dioxol 5 ylmethylene) 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/pd [Pharmacology] 7 benzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/cm [Drug Comparison] 7 benzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/dv [Drug Development] 7 benzylidene 6,7 dihydro 8h [1,3]dioxolo[4,5 g]chromen 8 one/pd [Pharmacology] acridine orange aldehyde chloride doxorubicin/cm [Drug Comparison] ethidium bromide etoposide/cm [Drug Comparison] *isoflavonoid/cm [Drug Comparison] *isoflavonoid/dv [Drug Development] *isoflavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] propionic acid unclassified drug",NA,"22","2014",-1

Our studies demonstrate the mechanistic importance of chemical structure similarities and cell type/promoter specificity when evaluating the potential activities of EDCs. The synthetic EDCs, such as BPA and its analogs, mainly affect ERa and can act as both agonists and antagonists in a dose-dependent manner. The natural EDCs (daidzein and genistein) are stronger estrogens due to their estrogenic activations for both ERa and ERbeta.

Espie","How can hot flushes and breast cancer be managed effectively and without risk?","For patients with breast cancer, the return to a normal quality of life is a key element in their well-being. The onset of hot flushes, whether natural or induced by anti-cancer therapy, can make it difficult to achieve this goal. As hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated in these women, other therapeutic methods must be considered. After a comprehensive review of the physiopathology of hot flushes and of the factors aggravating their frequency and severity in patients with breast cancer or in remission, this article takes stock of relevant scientific literature in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the various pharmacological and non-hormonal methods for treating flushes. It clarifies the place of a product consisting of purified pollen cytoplasm extracts Serelys /Femal as part of the therapeutic arsenal available to postmenopausal women with breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer. The review of the literature shows that the use of antidepressants (venlafaxine, paroxetine, citalopram and fluoxetine), antihypertensives (clonidine) or anticonvulsants (gabapentin and pregabalin) significantly reduces the frequency and severity of hot flushes. The superiority of either of these methods has not, however, been demonstrated. However, the interaction of these products with anti-cancer therapy taken by the patient (usually tamoxifen) and the many side effects induced must be taken into consideration before proposing one of these therapies. The available data do not support the use of 'natural' health products such as phytoestrogens, black cohosh and St. John's wort in the treatment of hot flushes. Few studies have been conducted and none has demonstrated a significant impact on the frequency or severity of hot flushes. Moreover, the use of some of these products, including St. John's wort and black cohosh, could be harmful for patients treated with tamoxifen because they interfere with its metabolism. They are known for their oestrogenic activity, which renders their use inadvisable in women with breast cancer or in remission. All these data emphasize the need for a safe and effective alternative treatment for the management of menopause in these patients. Sere- lys /Femal , which is made from pollen extracts, has demonstrated its clinical efficacy with respect to the most frequent climacteric symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats. It substantially improves quality of life for postmenopausal women and proves to be a non-oestrogenic alternative to hormone therapy, particularly in postmenopausal women with breast cancer or in remission. The absence of significant amounts of phytoestrogens in its components, the absence of oestrogenic activity or uterotrophic effect and the excellent tolerance reported in clinical studies enable it to be offered safely to patients with menopausal symptoms. Serelys /Femal therefore has its place in the arsenal of therapies available to gynaecologists and oncologists faced with a demand for safe, non-hormonal strategies capable of relieving hot flushes in women who have breast cancer or who have survived such a cancer.",NA,"*breast cancer *risk *menopause *hot flush human female patient postmenopause remission cancer therapy quality of life therapy Actaea racemosa pathophysiology health hormone substitution cytoplasm side effect pollen scientific literature wellbeing hormonal therapy metabolism menopausal syndrome night sweat safety clinical study oncologist neoplasm phytoestrogen tamoxifen paroxetine venlafaxine pregabalin antidepressant agent gabapentin anticonvulsive agent fluoxetine antihypertensive agent citalopram pollen extract clonidine","107","17","2014",-1

We conducted a pilot 2 x 2 factorial, randomized intervention study between tumor biopsy and resection, in 24 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, to assess the effects of FS and anastrozole, and possible interactions between them, on serum steroid hormone and tumor-related characteristics associated with long-term survival (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, 2007-2010). The effect of each treatment vs. placebo on outcomes was determined by linear regression adjusting for pretreatment measure, stage, and grade. Although not statistically significant, mean ERbeta expression was approximately 40% lower from pre- to postintervention in the FS + AI group only. We observed a statistically significant negative association (beta + SE -0.3 + 0.1; P = 0.03) for androstenedione in the FS + AI group vs. placebo and for DHEA with AI treatment (beta + SE -1.6 + 0.6; P = 0.009).

Mandal","Preparation and cellular delivery of doxorubicin nanoemulsion for cancer therapy","Purpose: The aim of this study is to formulate a novel nanoemulsion of doxorubicin to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the drug. Method: Four different multiple emulsions (W1/O/W2) were prepared (A, B, C, and D) by homogenization of a mixture of aqueous and oil phases. The resultant primary emulsions were later pass through a high pressure homogenization to further reduce the globules size to nanometer range. The formulation A is a control nanoemulsion, consisted of only deionized water as W1 phase. The W1 phase of the other three formulations (B, C, and D) consisted of aqueous solution of BSA (as an emulsion stabilizer), doxorubicin, and a mixture of BSA and doxorubicin, respectively. For all four formulations, the oil phase (O) consisted of a 2:1 mixture of soyabean oil and Span 80, and the outer aqueous phase (W2) consisted of prolaxamer P-85 and Vitamin E TPGS. The nanoemulsions were evaluated for stability, polydispersity index, size, and viscosity. Anticancer efficacy of these formulations was evaluated by Alamar Blue Assay and Colony Forming Assay using MCF-7 cells as a model malignant breast cancer cell line. Results: The stability of nanoemulsions was found to be significantly better for the formulations containing BSA. Presence of BSA or doxorubicin resulted in a significant increase in viscosity from 2.09 to 10.6 cP. Cell culture studies showed that doxorubicin nanoemulsions had higher localization in cytoplasm as compared to the nucleus. In regard to cellular uptake (intracellular quantification of doxorubicin), the following results were obtained at 2h, 24h, 48h, and 120h post-incubation, respectively: 42%, 30%, 37%, and 22% with doxorubicin solution; 12%, 19%, 21%, 33% with formulation C; and 0.25%, 6%, 10%, 19% with formulation D. The results of Alamar Blue Assay showed IC50 values of 0.97muM (solution), 1.62muM (formulation C) and 1.91muM (formulation D). The results of Colony Forming Assay (12days-post-treatment with equivalent to 0.86 muM doxorubicin) showed 74% (solution), 86% (formulation C) and 92.6% (formulation D) growth inhibitions. Conclusions: The presence of BSA within the aqueous phase enhances the stability of nanoemulsions. In comparison to doxorubicin solution, the nanoemulsions produce higher anticancer efficacy. This exploratory study will be followed by more detailed studies to confirm this preliminary finding.",NA,"*nanoemulsion *cancer therapy *cancer research emulsion resazurin assay viscosity assay breast cancer cell line soybean aqueous solution therapy mcf 7 cell line model growth inhibition cell culture cytoplasm hyperbarism *doxorubicin stabilizing agent water alpha tocopherol sorbitan oleate",NA,"70","2010",-1

Oxaliplatin has been used as a second line therapy in combination with gemcitabine but the beneficial effect was mitigated due to 'off target' toxicity as well as due to de novo and acquired resistance. However, effort toward restoration of sensitivity of PC cells to low concentrations of oxaliplatin is an emerging area of research. Here we report our in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence in support of chemo-sensitization of gemcitabine resistant PC cells (Panc-1, Panc-28 and MiaPaCa-2) by a non-toxic chemopreventive agent known as genistein. Genistein pretreatment of PC cells exhibiting moderate (Panc-1, Panc-28) to less gemcitabine sensitivity (MiaPaCa-2) using low concentrations of oxaliplatin resulted in a significant reduction in the viability of cells concomitant with increased apoptosis (p<0.01) occurred in a synergistic manner as assessed by colony formation experiments. Since drug-resistance of PC is allegedly linked with constitutive activation of NF-{kappa}B as well as further activation by conventional chemotherapeutic agents including oxaliplatin, our mechanistic showed that inactivation of NF-{kappa}B by genistein prior to treatment of cell with oxaliplatin is required for the killing of drug resistant cells, which indeed was consistent with the down- regulation of NF-{kappa}B and its downstream anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 XIAP's, survivin) leading to the appearance of cleaved PARP and induction of apoptosis. Most importantly, our in vivo experiments using orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer showed significant reduction in tumor size (p<0.01) and reduction of locoregional lymph node metastasis when genistein was given in combination with oxaliplatin compared to monotherapy. These results were also consistent with inactivation of NF-{kappa}B and the down-regulation of NF-kB downstream targets (Bcl-xL, survivin and XIAP), all of which was consistent with in vitro findings. Both in vitro as well as in vivo findings were also consistent with immunohistochemistry findings on proliferation marker (Ki-67), apoptosis (TUNEL) and phospho p-65 immunostaining. From these results, we conclude that our results provide strong in vivo evidence in support of our hypothesis showing that genistein sensitizes drug-resistant pancreatic cancer to oxaliplatin, which is mechanistically linked with inactivation of NF-{kappa}B, which could be a useful strategy for the treatment of PC in the future.",NA,"*chemosensitivity *pancreas cancer *cancer cell *in vitro study *xenograft *mouse *mouse model *cancer research apoptosis down regulation immunohistochemistry toxicity therapy hypothesis chemotherapy monotherapy lymph node metastasis tumor volume gene drug resistance colony formation sensitization cancer therapy *genistein *oxaliplatin *gemcitabine immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein survivin marker antiinfective agent",NA,"70","2010",-1

Yu","Soy isoflavone intake, MDM2 gene polymorphism and breast cancer risk among Chinese women in Singapore","Epidemiologic studies among populations that consume moderate to high amount of soy have shown that soy isoflavones may reduce breast cancer risk, and the chemopreventive effects are postulated to be related to the anti-estrogenic properties of soy isoflavones. Recently, experimental studies have revealed that dietary isoflavones may also down-regulate the expression of the MDM2 oncogene, and the inhibition of the expression of the MDM2 oncoprotein has in turn been associated with antitumor activities in breast cancer models. Furthermore, a polymorphism in the promoter region of MDM2 SNP309 (T>G change at nucleotide 309 in the first intron; rs2279744) leads to increased expression of the oncogene and has been associated with earlier onset of breast cancer. We have previously shown that postmenopausal women with a higher than median intake of soy have a reduced risk of breast cancer compared with those with a lower intake. If down-regulation of the MDM2 oncogene is one of the mechanistic pathways for the chemopreventive effects of soy isoflavones in breast cancer, we postulate that the protective effect of soy isoflavones on breast cancer will be stronger in those possessing the high-activity MDM2 genotype. To confirm this hypothesis, we conducted a nested case-control study among 281 incident, postmenopausal breast cancer cases and 462 postmenopausal control subjects within the Singapore Chinese Health Study Cohort. Overall, there was no significant association between MDM2 gene polymorphism and breast cancer risk. Postmenopausal women who had a higher than median intake of soy had a reduced risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR), 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-1.03]. This inverse association was principally noted among women homozygous for the high activity MDM2 allele (GG genotype). There was a statistically significant, roughly 50% reduction in breast cancer risk between above versus below median level of soy consumption in this subgroup of women (OR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.98). On the other hand, a much weaker, and statistically nonsignificant association was noted among women possessing the lower-activity MDM2 genotypes (OR, 0.86, 95% CI, 0.59-1.24). Our findings suggest that the ability of soy isoflavones to down-regulate the MDM2 oncoprotein may be one etiologic mechanism through which the intake of soy is associated with breast cancer protection.",NA,"*DNA polymorphism *breast cancer *cancer risk *female *human *Singapore *cancer research oncogene genotype risk postmenopause confidence interval intron population promoter region cancer model epidemiology antineoplastic activity protection allele health case control study hypothesis down regulation experimental study *isoflavone isoflavone derivative oncoprotein nucleotide",NA,"70","2010",-1

Banerjee","Effect of soy isoflavones on prostate cancer cell cycle regulation and apoptosis","Background: As many as one-third of all cancer deaths in the United States can be linked to diet. Significant epidemiological evidence suggests a role of a variety of dietary factors including the amount of dietary soy. In Asian countries where the average diet consists of 10 times the amount of soy products consumed compared to the average American diet there is a significantly lower incidence of prostate and breast cancer. Further supporting a dietary and environmental influence is the finding that Asian immigrants who have moved to the United States and adopt a Western diet have a prostate cancer incidence that approaches U.S. born males. These findings have been supported by other studies and, again, suggest that environmental factors such as dietary soy intake may be responsible for these differences in geographic incidence. Although there is this preclinical and epidemiological data suggesting that soy isoflavones decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer (PC), there is limited information regarding the in vivo effects of soy supplementation on human PC and benign prostate tissue. Methods: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the molecular effects of soy isoflavones on human PC cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Patients with histologically confirmed PC who had chosen radical prostatectomy (RRP) for treatment (without any other primary therapy) were randomized in double blind fashion to receive either soy supplementation or placebo. The patients in the treatment group received 4 capsules of a commercially available pure soy tablet (240 mg of total isoflavones) from time of enrollment until RRP. At the time of surgery, fresh tissue was collected from the tumor and adjacent normal tissue. Using these samples, we evaluated the status of genes essential for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis using cDNA microarray analyses. Results: In this preliminary analysis, multiple cell cycle and apoptotic genes were either down regulated or up regulated in the treatment samples compared to the placebo treated samples, including BAX, BCL-2, and Caspase-7. This effect was present in both tumor and adjacent normal tissue. Using samples from an additional four patients, we then further characterized these changes in gene expression using Western Blots analysis. Cleaved caspase-7 was up regulated in soy treated tumor and adjacent normal samples when compared to placebo, suggesting that soy mediates apoptosis though Caspace-7. The expression of BCL2L1 was down regulated in the treated compared to placebo tissue with this change being most marked in the adjacent normal samples.

However, NF-kappaB is persistently active in a number of disease states, including cancer. It has been reported that chemo-or radio-resistant cancer cells had elevated NF-kappaB activity. Recent studies including ours have showed that genistein, a soy-derived isoflavonoid, has antitumor activity in various cancer cells. Objective: In this study, we evaluated whether genistein could sensitize ionizing radiation resistance of cervical cancer cells through regulation of NF-kappaB. Methods: Six cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, CaSki, C33A, ME180, SiHa, HeLa229) were treated by 20 Gy radiation with 50 M genistein or not. Cell growth rate was measured by MTT assay and protein expression level was analyzed by western blotting. Protein localization was observed by confocal microscopic analysis. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was measured by luciferase reporter gene assay. NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was evaluated by electophoretic mobility shift assay. Results: Among six cervical cancer cells, HeLa and HeLa229 cells showed radio-resistance accompanied by elevated NF-kappaB activity. Ionizing radiation induced NF-kappaB nuclear transclocation and stimulated NF-kappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activities. However, pretreatment with genistein inhibited radiation induced transcriptional activity coincident to decreased radio-resistancy. Genistein also inhibited radiation-induced NF-kappaB regulated anti-apoptotic gene expression including c-myc, Survivin, XIAP, Bcl-2, IAP-1, TRAF, A1/Bfl-1 and FLIP.

Sarkar","Up-regulation of miR-146a contributes to the inhibition of invasion of pancreatic cancer cells","Pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignancy with high mortality primarily due to its highly invasive and metastatic behavior. Over-expression of EGFR and activation of NF-{kappa}B are frequently observed in PC associated with high metastatic capacity. Emerging evidence also suggest the critical role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of various biological and pathological processes including metastasis. Moreover, miR-146a has been found to be lost in metastatic prostate cancer and its expression reduces the metastatic potential of breast cancer cells through repression of IRAK1 (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1) and subsequent inhibition of NF-{kappa}B activity. In the present study, we assessed the expression pattern of miRNAs in the normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells and pancreatic cancer cells. We also investigated whether the treatment of PC cells with either B-DIM (BioResponse formulated 3,3'-diinodolylmethane with greater bioavailability) or G2535 (a mixture of genistein and other isoflavones) could alter the expression of miRNAs and their targets that are involved in the processes of invasion and metastasis. We found lower expression of miR-146a in PC cells compared to normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells. Interestingly, re-expression of miR-146a inhibited the invasive capacity of Colo357 and Panc-1 PC cells with concomitant down-regulation of EGFR and IRAK-1. Mechanistic studies including miR-146a re-expression, anti-miR-146 transfection, and EGFR knock-down experiment showed that there was a crosstalk between EGFR, MTA-2, IRAK-1, I{kappa}B{alpha}, and NF-{kappa}B. Most importantly, we found that the treatment of PC cells with B-DIM or G2535 could increase the expression of miR-146a and consequently down-regulated the expression of EGFR, MTA-2, IRAK-1, and NF-{kappa}B, resulting in the inhibition of invasion of Colo357 and Panc-1 cells. These results provide experimental evidence in support of the role of DIM and isoflavone as a potential non-toxic agent as regulators of miRNA, which could be useful for the inhibition of cancer cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that these agents could be important for designing novel targeted strategy for the treatment of PC.",NA,"*pancreas cancer *cancer cell *cancer research *upregulation metastasis epithelium cell pancreas duct metastasis potential prostate cancer cell invasion genetic transfection breast cancer mortality bioavailability down regulation *microRNA 146a microRNA immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein toxic substance genistein interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1 isoflavone derivative I kappa B alpha isoflavone",NA,"70","2010",-1

Recent statistics reveal 37,000 new cases diagnosed in US alone in 2008 and worldwide almost 27 million patients are affected. Diet has always been of prime importance in its association with cancer development and prevention. Several studies have found inverse association of cancer risk with consumption of dietary products, such as tomatoes, soy and cruciferous vegetables. We have been studying the effect of DIM (3,3'-diindolylmethane), a chemopreventive agent against hormone responsive cancers. In this study we show that thyroid cells express functional estrogen receptor (ER) -{alpha} and ER-beta and DIM has anti-cancer effects on estrogen responsive thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that DIM does not affect the levels of ER but it does target metastatic phenotype of thyroid cells as evidenced by decreased adhesion, invasion and migration in vitro. In an attempt to define the cellular target of this inhibition, we observed that DIM mediates down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cell adhesion proteins, integrins. This correlates with decreased thyroid cell proliferation and inhibition of metastatic propensity by DIM in thyroid cancer cells. These preclinical studies are being extended to the clinic where the anti-estrogenic property of DIM is being examined in goiter patients.",NA,"*thyroid cancer *cancer cell *cancer research thyroid cell neoplasm goiter patient human implantable cardiac monitor statistics endocrine tumor diet cell adhesion cell proliferation hospital prevention cancer risk in vitro study phenotype diseases vegetable tomato adhesion down regulation thyroid gland *estrogen *3,3' diindolylmethane matrix metalloproteinase protein integrin hormone estrogen receptor alpha",NA,"70","2010",-1

The overexpression of Akt, a prosurvival pathway, and vimentin, a mesenchymal marker, in urological carcinomas has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Our study investigated the effects of a soy isoflavone concentrate (ISF) on the expression of Akt and vimentin in a) cultured human prostate cancer cells and b) xenograft tumors in mice. METHODS: Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, which are androgen-insensitive and do not express p53 or PTEN, were grown in culture. Hypoxia exposure was at 1% oxygen vs room air for 48 hours. Akt, phosphorylated-Akt (phosAkt), carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and vimentin expression in cells was measured by Western immunoblot analysis. Male nude mice on a soy-free control diet were injected with PC-3 cells into the hind flank. On day 5, half the mice were placed on a diet containing 0.5% soy isoflavone concentrate (ISF). Tumor size was monitored biweekly. Resected tumors were fixed in formalin and paraffin-embedded. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of tumors used antibodies against PCNA, TUNEL, CAIX, Akt, phosAkt, and vimentin. RESULTS: In culture, PC-3 cells constitutively express high levels of Akt and vimentin proteins, which is not altered by hypoxia; in contrast, phosAkt and CAIX proteins are highly expressed only under hypoxic conditions. ISF caused dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell viability without evidence of apoptotic cell death. In culture, ISF decreased the constitutive expression of vimentin, as well as the hypoxia-mediated induction of pAkt and CAIX. In mice, the soy ISF diet significantly inhibited xenograft tumor growth. At 39 days, median tumor size was 862 mm3 in soy-free controls, and 520 mm3 in mice on the ISF diet (p=0.02). IHC analysis of tumors shows that ISF decreased the expression of nuclear PCNA, while TUNEL positive apoptotic cells was increased 4-fold. The ISF diet markedly suppressed levels of total Akt and activated phosAkt. In contrast, staining for CAIX protein was not different in control vs ISF-tumors. Vimentin was clearly expressed in PC-3 tumors and was increased by exposure to irradiation (IR, 2Gy). Interestingly, ISF suppressed IR-induced vimentin expression. Thus, soy ISF treatment inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo, but different mechanisms are involved in the regulation of expression of the dominant Akt prosurvival signaling pathway, as well as a major mesenchymal marker vimentin. CONCLUSIONS: Together, data indicate that a soy ISF diet strongly inhibits the growth of prostate xenograft tumors which is mediated by differential effects on hypoxia-regulated genes in the tumor microenvironment.

Since human ER- Neu over-expressing mammary cancers often also have mutations in P53, a heterozygous KO of P53 was incorporated into the model. We have used this model to examine a wide variety of potential chemopreventive agents. The agents were routinely administered to virgin female MMTV-Neu/P53 KO mice beginning when they were 60 days of age. Initiation of treatment with the agents at this time is later than that often employed by other investigators (usually 35 days of age). Mice were routinely monitored until 360 days of age. It was found that both RXR agonists (Targretin, UAB-30) and EGFR 1 and/or 2 inhibitors (Tarceva, Lapatinib) were highly effective in preventing the development of these cancers. These results agree with previously published results by Dr. Powell Brown and colleagues. It was also observed that a wide variety of agents were ineffective; including Atorvastatin, rosiglitazone (a PPAR gamma agonist), SAHA (an HDAC inhibitor) and a soy isoflavones mixture. In separate studies, mice bearing small palpable mammary tumors were treated for five days with these various agents, and examined for alterations in potential biomarkers; including proliferation. As previously shown by our lab in an ER+ rat model of mammary cancer, effective agents (e.g., Iressa and Targretin) strongly inhibited cancer cell proliferation, whereas ineffective agents failed to significantly inhibit proliferation. Such a short-term assay might be employed to determine potential chemopreventive compounds. This model, therefore, appears useful in identifying agents that will prevent the development of breast cancer that over-express Neu.

Increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) associated with decreased omega-6 (n-6), resulting in a higher n-3/n-6 ratio compared with the western diet, are inversely associated with BC risk, as shown by Yang et al. in their meta-analysis in BMC Cancer. High consumption of polyphenols and organic foods increase the n-3/n-6 ratio, and in turn may decrease BC risk. Intake of high fiber foods and foods with low glycemic index decreases insulin resistance and diabetes risk, and in turn may decrease BC risk. The modernized Mediterranean diet is an effective strategy for combining these recommendations, and this dietary pattern reduces overall cancer risk and specifically BC risk. High-risk women should also eliminate environmental endocrine disruptors, including those from foods. Drugs that decrease the n-3/n-6 ratio or that are suspected of increasing BC or diabetes risk should be used with great caution by high-risk women and women wishing to decrease their BC risk.

Ganapathi","Mechanisms regulating resistance to inhibitors of topoisomerase II","Inhibitors of topoisomerase II (topo II) are clinically effective in the management of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The efficacy of anti-tumor drugs targeting topo II is often limited by resistance and studies with in vitro cell culture models have provided several insights on potential mechanisms. Multidrug transporters that are involved in the efflux and consequently reduced cytotoxicity of diverse anti-tumor agents suggest that they play an important role in resistance to clinically active drugs. However, in clinical trials, modulating the multidrug-resistant phenotype with agents that inhibit the efflux pump has not had an impact. Since reduced drug accumulation per se is insufficient to explain tumor cell resistance to topo II inhibitors several studies have focused on characterizing mechanisms that impact on DNA damage mediated by drugs that target the enzyme. Mammalian topo IIa and topo IIbeta isozymes exhibit similar catalytic, but different biologic, activities. Whereas topo IIa is associated with cell division, topo IIbeta is involved in differentiation. In addition to site specific mutations that can affect drug-induced topo II-mediated DNA damage, post-translation modification of topo II primarily by phosphorylation can potentially affect enzyme-mediated DNA damage and the downstream cytotoxic response of drugs targeting topo II. Signaling pathways that can affect phosphorylation and changes in intracellular calcium levels/calcium dependent signaling that can regulate site-specific phosphorylation of topoisomerase have an impact on downstream cytotoxic effects of topo II inhibitors. Overall, tumor cell resistance to inhibitors of topo II is a complex process that is orchestrated not only by cellular pharmacokinetics but more importantly by enzymatic alterations that govern the intrinsic drug sensitivity. 2013 Ganapathi and Ganapathi.",NA,"article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium cell level cell division DNA damage drug cytotoxicity drug efficacy drug mechanism *drug resistance drug targeting enzyme phosphorylation hematologic malignancy/dt [Drug Therapy] human in vitro study lung small cell cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman phenotype protein processing signal transduction solid tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] amsacrine/pd [Pharmacology] anthracycline/pd [Pharmacology] calcium/ec [Endogenous Compound] daunorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing)/ec [Endogenous Compound] DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy] doxorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] etoposide/dt [Drug Therapy] etoposide/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *gyrase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] *gyrase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] irinotecan/pd [Pharmacology] mitoxantrone/pd [Pharmacology] multidrug resistance protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] teniposide/pd [Pharmacology] topotecan/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug vincristine/pd [Pharmacology]",NA,"4 AUG","2013",-1

Factors that induce tDCs have been reported, however the intracellular mechanisms involved are rarely discussed. Methods Circulating CD14+CD16+ of breast cancer patients and induced CD14 +CD16+ DCs were identified as tDCs by treating CD14 + monocytes with galectin-1 and cancer cell-derived medium combined with IL-4 and GM-CSF. In addition, the 4T1 breast cancer syngeneic xenograft model was used to investigate the effect of galectin-1 in vivo. Results The CD14+CD16+ tDC population in the breast cancer patients was comparatively higher than that in the healthy donors, and both the MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium and galectin-1 could induce tDC differentiation. In a BALB/c animal model, the 4T1 breast cancer cell line enhanced IL-10 expression in CD11c+ DCs which was down-regulated after knocking down the galectin-1 expression of 4T1 cells. Analysis of galectin-1 interacting proteins showed that myosin IIa was a major target of galectin-1 after internalization through a caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Myosin IIa specific inhibitor could diminish the effects of galectin-1 on monocyte-derived tDCs and also block the 4T1 cell induced CD11c+/Ly6G+/IL-10 + in the BALB/c mice. Conclusions Galectin-1 can induce tDCs after internalizing into CD14+ monocytes through the caveolae-dependent pathway and activating myosin IIa. For the breast cancer patients with a high galectin-1 expression, blebbistatin and genistein show potential in immune modulation and cancer immunotherapy.

Lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has been reported among obese persons seeking intensive treatment for their disease. To aid in the treatment of obesity, meal replacements have been recommended as an effective therapeutic strategy for weight loss, particularly when consumed in the beginning of an intervention. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the impact of two 12-month weight reduction interventions (one arm including a meal replacement) on changes in HRQOL among obese females. Methods: This controlled trial compared two versions of a standardized 12-month weight reduction intervention: the weight-reduction lifestyle program without a meal replacement (LS) versus the same lifestyle program with the addition of a soy-based meal replacement product (LSMR). 380 women (LS: n = 190, LSMR: n = 190) were matched by age, gender, and weight (51.4 + 7.0 yrs., 35.5 + 3.03 kg/m2). This sample of women all completed the 12-month lifestyle intervention that was part of a larger study. The lifestyle intervention included instruction on exercise/sport, psychology, nutrition, and medicine in 18 theoretical and 40 practical units. Led by a sport physiologist, participants engaged in group-based exercise sessions once or twice a week. To evaluate HRQOL, all participants completed the SF-36 questionnaire pre- and post-intervention. Anthropometric, clinical, physical performance (ergometric stress tests), and self-reported leisure time physical activity (hours/day) data were collected. Results: The LSMR sample showed lower baseline HRQOL scores compared to the LS sample in six of eight HRQOL dimensions, most significant in vitality and health perception (p < 0.01). After the intervention, body weight was reduced in both lifestyle intervention groups (LS: -6.6+6.6 vs. LSMR -7.6+7.9 kg), however, weight loss and HRQOL improvements were more pronounced in the LSMR sample (LSMR: seven of eight, LS: four of eight dimensions). Conclusions: Our results show that HRQOL may improve among middle-aged obese females during a standardized lifestyle weight reduction program and may be enhanced by consuming a soy-based meal replacement product.

However, use of traditional hormone replacement therapy containing estradiol is controversial as it is associated with an elevated incidence of breast cancer. As such, there is considerable interest in identifying novel, plant-derived, phytoestrogens that can mimic the protective actions of estrogen in the colon. Trigonelline (Trig) and 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM) are phytoestrogens which have distinct chemical structures compared to other well described phytoestrogens and both compounds have been reported to elicit estrogenic responses without directly interacting with the binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER). In this study, we evaluated the ability of these compounds to influence non-malignant colonocytes in vitro which we have demonstrated is predictive of chemopreventative effects in vivo. Both Trig and DIM suppressed cell growth of young adult mouse colonocytes (YAMCs). Likewise, Trig and DIM disrupted cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase and Trig induced programmed cell death. Co-treatment with ICI 182,780, an ER antagonist, inhibited the effects of Trig but not DIM. Interestingly, DIM did induce transcriptional activity of the ER. In addition, both compounds altered gene expression associated with apoptosis and cell proliferation in unique ways. In conclusion, Trig and DIM alter cell physiology and gene expression in YAMCs via unique estrogenic actions and these data suggest that consumption of these dietary compounds may reduce risk of colon cancer development.",NA,"*cell growth apoptosis gene expression colorectal cancer human cell proliferation hormone substitution colon cancer breast cancer chemical structure in vitro study young adult mouse cell cycle progression plant cell function estrogen activity risk exposure clinical study *estrogen *trigonelline phytoestrogen estradiol 3,3' diindolylmethane estrogen receptor",NA,"28","2014",-1

Bone formation marker osteocalcin which is only secreted by osteoblasts was measured by a urine ELISA kit generated in our laboratory. Bone resorption marker, collagen crosslink N-terminal telopeptide (NTx), was measured using a commercial kit. While there were no significant differences between MF and SF groups in bone formation and resorption markers, osteocalcin was substantially increased in both MF and SF groups compared to those from BM group (p < 0.01). NTx was also increased (p < 0.05) but to a lesser degree. We reproduced these results in a piglet animal model where male and female neonatal piglets (n=6 per group) were fed BM, MF or SF for 20 days. There were no gender differences in increased osteocalcin in MF and SF groups in urine compared to those from BM group.

This study was aimed at investigating whether glyceollins exert anticancer activity through regulation of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes. That is, I was interested in investigating if glyceollins can inhibit DMBA-induced breast cancer development by enhancing xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as glutation S -transferase, glucuronyl transferase, and sulfotransferase. The expression of phase 2 enzymes in organs collected from mice was assessed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry(IHC). Also we observed the tumor formation in mammary grand mice by whole mount analysis. The number of fat pad TEBs in the mammary tissue was significantly increased by DMBA treated and reduced by co treatment with glyceollins. Also glyceollins were found to induce same antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes in the liver. Therefore, we suspected that DMBA had little effect on mammary tissue as it was rapidly metabolized by detoxifying enzymes induced by glyceollins.

Based on the SDC made through different fermenting time, the relationship between physicochemical properties and in vitro anticancer effects were evaluated by pH, acidity, total viable count, amino and ammonia type nitrogens, activity of -GTP, sensory evaluation, MTT and RT-PCR analysis. As the fermentation time increased, the pH and the total viable count increased in SDC. SDC fermented for 48 hour demonstrated the highest content of acidity and -GTP activity. The ammonium nitrogen and amino acid nitrogen contents of 48 h fermented SDC were a little lower than 60 h fermented SDC, but much higher than 24 h fermented SDC. The 48 h fermented SDC also appeared the highest content of daidzein and genistein. At 2 mg/mL concentration, the growth inhibitory rate of 48 h fermented SDC was 78.8% higher than that of sea 24 h and 60 h fermented SDC in MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells.

The cells were cultivated in estrogen-free media in the presence of phytoestrogen for 48 h following with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation. The mRNA expression and the secretion of BD were analyzed by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. The cells expressed and secreted BD2 with a greater extent than other BD subtypes (BD1, 3 or 4). A 4-h inoculation with poly I:C decreased the BD2 secretion. Pretreatment with Ge (0.1 nM or 1 muM) increased both the expression and secretion of BD2 in response to LPS. However, Ge at 0.1 nM prevented the poly I:C suppressed BD2 secretion. Under poly I:C inoculation, Di (0.1 nM) induced the BD2 secretion but it did not affect the expression.

This study investigated the mechanisms explaining this effect. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were supplemented with 0 or 500 ppm GEN before puberty. Mammary carcinogen DMBA was administered at 48 days of age, and four dietary groups were established: lifelong GEN, prepubertal GEN, adult GEN and controls. Rats were then treated with 337 ppm TAM citrate via diet, and those fed GEN lifelong or during adult life were kept on GEN during TAM treatment. GEN was also given again to the rats consuming it at prepuberty and to some control rats. The remaining TAM treated control rats were never fed GEN. Tumors of rats fed GEN during prepuberty or lifelong exhibited reduced resistance to TAM, compared to no GEN controls, whilst adult only GEN intake caused TAM resistance (p<0.001). Mammary cancer recurrence rate was highest in the rats which started consuming GEN during TAM treatment (p<0.001). Chronic activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway has been linked to TAM resistance. We found that the active form of ATF6, ATF6 p50, was higher in normal mammary glands of lifelong GEN fed rats than in the controls (p<0.05). mRNA expression of its target genes, Xbp1 and GRP78, were also higher in the lifelong GEN group (p<0.05). However, the levels of GRP78, IRE1alpha, ATF4 and Beclin were significantly lower in the tumors of lifelong GEN exposed rats compared with adulthood only GEN fed rats (p<0.05). Thus, lifelong GEN intake may stimulate responsiveness of mammary tumors to TAM by affecting the UPR pathway:members of this pathway were activated in the normal mammary gland and suppressed in the tumors of lifelong GEN consuming rats.

Methods The effect of the ethanolic extract of M. amurensis stem bark on thyroid hormone activity was evaluated using thyroid hormone responsive-luciferase assay. We isolated tectoridin from the ethyl acetate fraction using a recrystallization method. T-screen assays were used to confirm thyroid hormone activity. The estrogenic activity of the ethyl acetate fraction of M. amurensis and tectoridin was evaluated by estrogen responsive-luciferase assay and estrogen receptor alpha regulation as compared to 17beta-estradiol. Results Both the ethyl acetate fraction and tectoridin activated thyroid-responsive reporters and increased thyroid hormone-dependent proliferation of rat pituitary GH3 cells, indicating modulation of thyroid hormone receptors. In parallel, the estrogenic activity of the fraction and tectoridin were characterized in a transient transfection system using estrogen-responsive luciferase plasmids in MCF-7 cells.

The basic aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of soy isoflavones (SIF) on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced cutaneous inflammatory responses and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. We have studied the protective effects of SIF against TPA induced oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines level, activation of NF-B, expression of COX-2 and ki-67 in mouse skin. Animals were divided into five groups I-V (n = 6). Groups II, III and IV received topical application of TPA at the dose of 10 nmol/0.2 ml of acetone/animal/day, for 2 days. Animals of the groups III and IV were pre-treated with SIF 1.0 mug (D1) and 2.0 mug (D2) topically 30 min prior to each TPA administration, while groups I and V were given acetone (0.2 ml) and SIF (D2), respectively. We have found that SIF pretreatment significantly inhibited TPA induced oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines production and activation of NF-B. SIF also inhibited the expression of COX-2 and ki-67. Histological findings further supported the protective effects of SIF against TPA-induced cutaneous damage. Thus, our results suggest that inhibitory effect of SIF on TPA-induced cutaneous inflammation includes inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, attenuation of oxidative stress, activation of NF-B and expression of COX-2. 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue article cell infiltration controlled study cytokine production cytokine release *dermatitis/dt [Drug Therapy] drug megadose enzyme activity epidermis hyperplasia female histology histopathology immunohistochemistry leukocyte lipid peroxidation mouse neutrophil chemotaxis nonhuman oxidative stress priority journal protein content protein expression skin edema skin protection *soybean acetone catalase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *cyclooxygenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] *daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] *daidzein/tp [Topical Drug Administration] *genistein/do [Drug Dose] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/tp [Topical Drug Administration] glutathione/ec [Endogenous Compound] *immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 1beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound] Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] nitric oxide/ec [Endogenous Compound] phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate/to [Drug Toxicity] superoxide dismutase/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]","266-274","302","2012",-1

Links have been established between urinary phytoestrogen levels and a number of sex hormone-dependent pathologic states, such as breast and endometrial cancer, vaginal atrophy and osteoporosis. We examined whether urinary levels of isoflavonetype (daidzein, o-desmethylangolensin, equol, and genistein) and lignan- type phytoestrogens (enterodiol and enterolactone) were associated with urinary symptoms in women. METHODS: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data collected from 2000 to 2010 was used to identify cohorts of 4104, 1648, and 2161 women, who responded to urinary incontinence, nocturia, and urinary symptom bother questionnaires, respectively. Urinary phytoestrogen levels were log transformed. Association between phytoestrogen levels, urge incontinence, stress incontinence, nocturia, bother from urinary incontinence, and the degree of effect of urinary incontinence on daily living was assessed using weighted multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, race, smoking status, body mass index, diabetes, parity, and menopausal status. RESULTS: Increasing concentration of lignan phytoestrogens enterolactone and enterodiol was associated with decreased likelihood of urge incontinence, bother from incontinence, and effect of urinary incontinence on daily living (p < 0.05). Increasing concentration of enterolactone was also associated with decreased likelihood of nocturia (p< 0.05). None of the isoflavone phytoestrogens were associated with urinary symptoms. Odds ratios per unit change in phytoestrogen concentration are given in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate an association between urinary phytoestrogen levels and urinary symptoms in a large population-based cohort of women. We demonstrate that members of the lignan phytoestrogen family may have a protective effect on urinary symptoms in women.

In the present study, we analysed data from two population-based case-control studies of ovarian (1366 cases and 1414 controls) and endometrial (1288 cases and 1435 controls) cancers. Dietary intake information was obtained using a 135-item FFQ, and phyto-oestrogen intake was estimated using published food composition databases. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted OR and 95 % CI. In multivariable analyses, there was a suggestive pattern of inverse associations between increasing intakes of total phyto-oestrogens, isoflavones and enterolignans and the risk of ovarian cancer. However, the results only reached statistical significance for the lignan compounds matairesinol and lariciresinol, where the OR for the highest v. the lowest intake category was 0.72 (95 % CI 0.54, 0.96; P for trend = 0.02) for matairesinol and 0.72 (95 % CI 0.55, 0.96; P for trend = 0.03) for lariciresinol.

Several in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated the anticancerogenic action of the flavonoids quercetin and genistein. However, human interventions still have to prove that these substances have chemopreventive efficacies. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of genistein and quercetin supplementation on the concentration and dynamics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men with rising PSA-levels. MATERIAL & METHODS: The first interim analysis of the ongoing QUERGEN trial included a total of 18 men with elevated PSA concentrations. The subjects were randomized to receive either 500 mg/d of quercetin (Q), 100 mg/d of genistein (G) or placebo (P) for 3 months. Serum PSA as primary endpoint and bioavailability of quercetin and genistein through HPLC analyses were assessed prior to intervention and after the supplementation period. RESULTS: The blood quercetin concentration increased significantly in the quercetin intervention group (pre: 0.5+0.07 mumol/l, post: 1.2+0.05 mumol/l, p=0.0313). Genistein supplementation also tended to increase genistein levels (pre: 1.1+0.05 mumol/, post: 1.3 +0.06 mumol/l, ns). Total and free PSA did not change significantly in none of the groups (Q: pre tPSA 8.9+2.9 ng/ml, post 10.5+3.8 ng/ml, ns; pre fPSA: 0.8+0.2 ng/ml, post: 1.0+0.3 ng/ml; ns; G: pre tPSA: 9.5+2.3 ng/ml, post: 9.6+2.2 ng/ml; ns; pre fPSA 0.7+0.1 ng/ml, post: 0.8+0.3 ng/ml, ns; P: pre tPSA: 6.3+0.8 ng/ml, post: 7.4+0.8 ng/ml, ns; pre fPSA 0.9+0.2 ng/ml, post: 0.8+0.1 ng/ml, ns). However, there was a trend to an inverse association between the PSA dynamics and the intake of genistein. After intervention PSA doupling time was higher in the genistein intervention group compared with quercetin and placebo receiving subjects (G: 16.2+7.8 months, Q: 7.0+2.8 months, P: 7.5+1.8 months, ns). Furthermore, the log2-transformated PSA slope was 0.08 ng/ml in the genistein group and thus lower compared to the other groups (P: 0.25 and Q: 0.20 ng/ml, ns). CONCLUSIONS: In this interim analysis, the results suggest that dietary intervention with genistein may have an impact on PSA slope in men with deviant PSA constellation suspicious for prostate cancer. In contrast, the intake of quercetin did not impact on PSA dynamics.

Using a lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus 20-92, that metabolizes daidzein to S-equol, we successfully produced a fermented soy ingredient containing S-equol. The clinical studies have suggested that the daily 10mg S-equol supplement alleviates hot flashes and muscle stiffness of neck and shoulder in both Japanese and US women. Although vasomotor symptoms and/or muscle stiffness are primary symptoms in Japan and the US, menopausal women are various and multiple symptomatic in general and not a few women's situations, like using hormone therapy (HT) or surviving gynecological cancers, were excluded from the clinical studies previously conducted. Thus, in these surveys, the wider range of symptomatic women was enrolled, and then they reported the self-rating menopausal symptoms to indicate their severity at each time point of the surveys. Design: In the survey in Japan, 1035 women, who were outpatients of 33 clinics or members of a non-profit organization for women's health, were participated. Participants were recommended to take 10mg S-equol supplement daily for 12 wks, then reported the severity of menopausal symptoms using the Climacteric Symptom Evaluation Checklist, which is a questionnaire with 4-point rating scale, at 0, 4, 8, and 12 wks. In addition, the subjective supplement evaluation as an overall menopausal symptom relief was reported with either ""improvement"", ""unchanged"", or ""aggravation"". In the US, 796 symptomatic women enrolled the survey with clinician's recommendation. Self rating of the supplement satisfaction and current symptom severity, on which they indicated how much for each with a choice of prepared answers on a questionnaire, were reported at 0, 3, 7, 12 and 16wks. Results: Five hundred sixty-six of 1035 participants were climacteric women aged 45- 55 years. In the 566 climacteric women, 46 were gynecological cancer survivors and 47 were HT users in Japanese survey. A total 60% of the climacteric women reported ""improvement"" in the overall symptoms. The rated score in somatic symptom was improved (P<0.05). In HT users, although the medical treatment did not alleviate the somatic symptoms, S-equol supplement decreased the scores (P<0.05). In addition, 62% of HT users were improved the overall symptoms, which was as same as that of non-HT users (57%). Fifty-five percents of gynecological (breast, endometrial, or ovarian) cancer survivors were improved the overall symptoms. The symptom scores for depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, backache and joint pain were decreased (P<0.05 in each symptom). In the survey of the US, approximately 80% participants reported the supplement satisfaction as ""very-"", ""somewhat-"", or ""slightly-satisfy"". The percentage of women who selected the answer, either ""extremely"" or ""quite a bit"" in the symptom severity instead of ""a little"" or ""not at all"" were 36~82% decreased in the symptoms addressed, ie. hot flash, night sweat, sleep disturbance, fatigue, change in sexual desire or drive, memory or concentration problem, mood swing or irritability, anxiety, depression, muscle discomfort, weight gain, hair loss and heavy period, at 3 wks. The reduction of each symptom severity was similar to the 3 wks at 7, 12 and 16wks. There are no serious adverse events reported during S-equol supplementation in both Japan and US surveys. Conclusion: Both in-home sample surveys suggest that S-equol supplement alleviates various climacteric symptoms more than hot flash and muscle stiffness/discomfort in Japanese and US symptomatic women, in which approximately 60% of the Japanese participants were HT users and gynecological cancer survivors. We believe these surveys have a practical significance, because S-equol supplement worked for various climacteric symptoms relief wi h various individual situations.",NA,"*climacterium *female *human *Japan *menopause *society Japanese gynecologic cancer cancer survivor menopausal syndrome hot flush muscle rigidity clinical study satisfaction anxiety self concept questionnaire muscle night sweat arthralgia backache shoulder breast neck therapy rating scale checklist health non profit organization Lactococcus hospital outpatient lactic acid bacterium population insomnia supplementation weight gain sleep disorder irritability mood memory fatigue hormonal therapy intestine flora hair loss metabolite *equol daidzein estrogen estrogen receptor isoflavone","1356-1357","20","2013",1

The plant has a long history in worldwide people for the usage of vaginal discharge, to promote menstruation and to induce abortions. Topical estrogen therapy is recommended for the treatment of vaginal atrophy. Therefore, the present study was carried out to evaluate the uterotrophic effects of phenolphthalein a phytoestrogenic molecule isolated from M. charantia seeds in post menopausal albino rats as an experimental model. Design: Uterine effects of phenolphthalein a phytoestrogenic molecule isolated from seeds of Momordica charantia Linn. were evaluated in post menopausal female albino rats. Each one of the formulations was administered intravaginally to groups of post menopausal rats with cytologically confirmed vaginal atrophy. The animals having groups I & II were treated with 2ml of 1% and 2% phenolphthalein gel (prepared by using Glycerol) respectively. In the Group III animals were treated with 2ml of 0.001% of 17- - estradiol (prepared by using Glycerol) and group IV served as control treated with glycerol. The doses were adjusted by animal body weight. After daily treatment for 14 days, the animals were sacrificed and their vaginas and uteri removed. All uteri were weighted. Uteri were fixed for histological and biochemical evaluation. Results: Both the doses of phenolphthalein gel and single dose of 17- - estradiol proved to be very effective in the cytological reversal of vaginal atrophy. The uterotrophic effects of phenolphthalein and 17- - estradiol produced a significant increase in uterine weight, myometrial and endometrial thickness as well as histological modifications in the endometrium suggestive of estrogenic activity. The biochemical evaluation of uteri showed phenolphthalein produced a dose dependent increase in DNA concentration. Conclusion: There is a significant uterotrophic effect of phenolphthalein gel as tested in a rat model of vaginal postmenopausal atrophy. There were dose dependent effective in reversing vaginal atrophy and significant estrogenic effect on the uterus. The study results suggested that M. charantia seeds having phytoestrogen phenolphthalein possess uterotrophic properties in experimental animals. Interestingly, in recent years, the popularity of different kinds of pharmaceutical preparations containing phytoestrogens has constantly increasing.

Kubota","S-equol increases no production of thoracic aorta in ovariectomized rats","Objective: Soy isoflavones are thought to activate estrogen receptors and exhibit estrogen like effect as SERM. It is expected that this role as phytoestrogen of soy isoflavones may have beneficial effects without side effects as estrogen replacement therapy to the women with menopausal disorders. We assessed about the role of S-equol for the function of nitric oxide (NO) production of vascular endothelial cells in an ovariectomized rat model. Design: Twelve-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four ovariectomized groups: control (n=9), E2 (7mug per day,17beta-estradiol, n=7),S-equol (200mug per day S-equol, n=12),and normal diet group(n=9). Rats except normal diet group were fed the AIN-93G diet, which contained no soy oil or soy protein three days after ovariectomy. At sixteen weeks, administration of each drug with subcutaneous osmotic pumps was started. At twenty weeks, all rats were sacrificed, and we measured uterine weight, plasma levels of estradiol and soy isoflavones (S-equol, Daizein, Genistein), cyclic GMP levels within the vessel walls and changes in isometric tension of thoracic aorta. In the experiment of changes in isometric tension, specimens of thoracic aorta were cut into 5mm length, which was stretched to an optimal resting tension of 500mg for one hour in organ chamber in modified Krebs solution. During contraction caused by norepinephrine 10-6M, acetylcholine(ACh; 10-9 to 3 x 10-5M)or A23187(310-7M)was given in order to measure the endothelial dependent relaxation. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP;10-10 to3 10-5M) as an NO donor and NG-nitro-L-arginine (LNA; 10-4M) as an endothelial NO synthase inhibitor were used. ACh and SNP were applied into organ chamber in a cumulative fashion at increasing concentrations of 0.5 log unit. The levels of cyclic GMP as 2nd messenger of NO were determined by radioimmunoassay kit. All results are expressed as mean+SEM. Statistical analyses were performed with t-test or two-way ANOVA of stat view J 5.0program. Values of p<0.05 were considered as statistically significant. All studies complied with the AnimalWelfare Regulations of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University. Results: There was no change of body weight among control, S-equol and normal diet groups, whereas that of E2 group was decreased than others significantly. Uterine weight per body weight in E2 group was significantly increased than other groups. Plasma level of S-equol was determined only in S-Equol group and normal diet group, and that of Daizein and Genistein were determined in normal diet group alone. Plasma E2 level was higher only in E2 groups. The relaxation in response to ACh or A23187 was abolished by the endothelial removal and preincubation with LNA, suggesting that the relaxation is endothelium-dependent and mediated through activation of endothelial NOS. ACh and A23187 induced relaxations in the groups of E2, S-equol and normal diet were likewise increased than control group. On the other hand, SNP induced relaxations in all groups showed no difference, suggesting there was no change in NO sensitivity of smooth muscle cells.The levels of cyclic GMP in the groups of E2, S-equol,normal diet were significantly increased than control group. Conclusion: It was suggested that E2 and soy isoflavones similarly increase NO production of endothelial cells of thoracic aorta in an ovariectomized and isoflavone free rats.

Kortenkamp","Extending the applicability of the dose addition model to the assessment of chemical mixtures of partial agonists by using a novel toxic unit extrapolation method","Dose addition, a commonly used concept in toxicology for the prediction of chemical mixture effects, cannot readily be applied to mixtures of partial agonists with differing maximal effects. Due to its mathematical features, effect levels that exceed the maximal effect of the least efficacious compound present in the mixture, cannot be calculated. This poses problems when dealing with mixtures likely to be encountered in realistic assessment situations where chemicals often show differing maximal effects. To overcome this limitation, we developed a pragmatic solution that extrapolates the toxic units of partial agonists to effect levels beyond their maximal efficacy. We extrapolated different additivity expectations that reflect theoretically possible extremes and validated this approach with a mixture of 21 estrogenic chemicals in the E-Screen. This assay measures the proliferation of human epithelial breast cancers. We found that the dose-response curves of the estrogenic agents exhibited widely varying shapes, slopes and maximal effects, which made it necessary to extrapolate mixture responses above 14% proliferation. Our toxic unit extrapolation approach predicted all mixture responses accurately. It extends the applicability of dose addition to combinations of agents with differing saturating effects and removes an important bottleneck that has severely hampered the use of dose addition in the past. 2014 Scholze et al.",NA,"agonist article concentration response controlled study *dose addition model dose response Generalized Concentration Addition model intermethod comparison *mathematical model prediction predictive value *toxic unit extrapolation model 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene 1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane 3 (4 methylbenzylidene)camphor 3 benzylidene camphor 4 methoxycinnamic acid 2 ethylhexyl ester 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol 6 acetyl 1,1,2,4,4,7 hexamethyltetraline aldrin beta hexachlorocyclohexane butyl paraben camphor chemical compound chlorphenotane dieldrin endosulfan estradiol estrogen estrone genistein hexahydrohexamethylcyclopentabenzo pyran methoxychlor mitotane propyl paraben unclassified drug",NA,"9","2014",-1

Recent studies have confirmed their effect on different cellular targets and pathways overexpressed in cancer cells, e.g. glucose transporter-GLUT-1, estrogen receptors and tyrosine kinases. RadioMedix Inc. has developed novel class of isoflavone derivatives. They have been synthesized by coupling isoflavone glucuronides either directly to DOTA chelator (RMX-SC-11) or through-hydrophilic polyethylene glycol spacer (RMX-SC-12). RMX-SC agents have been labeled with 68GaCl3 in 0.5M NaOAc pH=4.1 at 95oC for 10min using 68Ge/68Ga generator (ITG GmbH-Germany). Their cellular uptake has been determined in several cancer cell lines e.g. breast-(SKBR-3, MCF-7), prostate-(PC-3, LNCaP) and lung-(A549). 68Ga-labeled agents were validated in xenograft model of SKBR-3, PC3 and A549 in microPET imaging studies recorded at different time intervals. They were further evaluated in biodistribution studies in SKBR-3 tumor bearing mice. Conjugation of the isoflavone to DOTA chelator significantly increased aqueous solubility and pharmacological stability of isoflavone and permitted its evaluation as tumor targeting ligand. Cellular uptake of both 68Ga-RMX-SC agents has been higher than 7 %ID/mg in all tested cancer cells lines (breast-MCF-7, SKBr3; prostate-LnCap, PC3; lung-A549). Their uptake was reduced more than 50% in the presence of increasing concentrations of GLUT1-transporter's inhibitor genistein (100-600uM). PET imaging studies of both 68Ga-agents have shown their fast and stable tumor-specific accumulation for as long as 120 minutes post-administration with elimination through liver and kidney.

The development of breast cancer is a multistep and complicated process that includes the development of ductal and lobular cells into atypical hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma, with an ability to metastasize. The efficacy of radiotherapy in breast cancer seems to be reduced because of a frequently observed lack of cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. Both Bcl-2 and p53 are linked to apoptosis pathways and are known to play a role in the outcome of radiotherapy. Resistance of tumor cells to therapeutic drugs and the undesirable cytotox-icity of normal cells are frequently observed in treatment outcomes in clinics. Research is, therefore, needed to develop strategies for improving the protocols of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer.

Therefore, modulation of these stress responses has been investigated as an alternative anticancer strategy, although their therapeutic clinical roles remain to be determined.

Detailed information on pathology, treatment and medication was obtained from hospital staff and information on lifestyle was self-reported by patients at baseline (9-15 months post breast cancer diagnosis). Current dietary intake was estimated using the EPIC-Norfolk FFQ, within which participants indicated the frequency of consumption of 131 food and beverage items. Portions of fruit, vegetables and fish consumed per day were calculated from the frequencies obtained. The frequencies were also converted to nutrients using the Compositional Analysis from Frequency Estimates (CAFE) nutritional analysis program(1). Mean daily intakes of twenty-eight nutrients were considered in the present analysis and percentage energy contributions from food groups were also calculated. Dietary intake was compared by tumour grade, lymph node status and breast cancer subtype, specifically triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER2-) breast cancer and all other breast cancer subtypes. In total, data for 3157 breast cancer patients was available for analysis. Women who were diagnosed with grade 1 breast cancer reported a lower percentage energy intake from fat (32.1%; SD: 6.2%) compared with women diagnosed with grade 3 breast cancer (32.8%; SD: 5.9%) (p = 0.01). Those with a positive node status reported higher intakes of vitamin C (149.1 mg; SD: 79.1 mg; p = 0.01), folate (318.3 mug; SD: 114.7 mug; p = 0.01), fibre (18.4 g; SD: 7.6 g; p = 0.01), vitamin A retinol equivalents (1304.6 mug; SD: 868.8 mug; p = 0.01) and portions of vegetables (5.2; SD: 3.3; p = 0.02) but lower calcium intake (849.9 mg; SD: 319.5 mg; p = 0.01) compared with women with no nodal involvement (vitamin C:142.2 mg, SD: 71.3 mg; folate: 307.6 mug, SD:101.8 mg; fibre: 17.7 g, SD: 6.9 g; vitamin A retinol equivalents: 1227.5 mug, SD: 750.6mug; vegetable portions: 4.9, SD: 2.6; calcium 879.7 mg, SD: 309.5 mg, respectively). Women with triple negative breast cancer reported a higher intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (13.5 g; SD: 6.2 g; p = 0.02) and vitamin E (12.6 mg; SD: 5.4 mg; p = 0.01) compared with other breast cancer subtypes (12.5 mg, SD 5.7 mg and 12.6 mg, SD 5.4 mg, respectively). Small and inconsistent differences in dietary intake were observed with common prognostic factors in DietCompLyf breast cancer patients. This is in contrast to some literature which suggests that prognostic factors, which may act as a motive for diet and lifestyle changes post-diagnosis(2), influence dietary intake amongst early stage breast cancer survivors(3).",NA,"*dietary intake *nutrition *society human breast cancer female cancer patient food nutrient pathology vegetable United Kingdom fiber lifestyle lymph node neoplasm event free survival fish cancer survivor lifestyle modification fruit vegetable cancer diagnosis triple negative breast cancer patient calcium intake hospital personnel drug therapy caloric intake diet diagnosis hospital retinol folic acid ascorbic acid calcium phytoestrogen polyunsaturated fatty acid alpha tocopherol","E161","72","2013",-1

Therefore, plant-derived alternatives are currently promoted. Phytoestrogens - primarily the isoflavones genistein, daidzein and coumestrol, stemming from soy (Glycine max) or red clover (Trifolium pratense) - were suggested to have the desired but not the undesired effects of estrogens. Most recently published placebo-controlled studies question the beneficial effects. When taken at the time of puberty however, phytoestrogens appear to protect against mammary cancer later in life. Extracts from the rhizome of Cimicifuga racemosa (black cohosh) have no estrogenic effects. In a narrow dose range they have beneficial effects on climacteric complaints, which are due to several compounds with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and GABAergic actions that act together in the hypothalamus. Ecdysone is produced by several plants, including spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and was very early on shown to increase muscle mass. Later it became apparent that spinach extracts containing ecdysone decreased body fat load, thereby reducing secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by visceral adipocytes and oxidative stress. This had beneficial effects on body weight and serum lipids not only in obese postmenopausal but also in premenopausal women and in men. For the above-described plant extracts, solid placebo-controlled clinical trials are available.

Choi","Bisphenol a-induced growth of ovarian cancer cells was reversed by a phytoestrogen, genistein, by inhibition of a crosstalk between estrogen receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor in in vitro and xenograft mouse models","It has been shown that oestrogen (E2) up-regulated the expression of components of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway and induced the downstream of mitogenic signaling cascades via phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). An interaction between oestrogen receptor (ER) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathway plays an important role in proliferation of and resistance to endocrine therapy to oestrogen-dependent cancers (i.e. breast and endometrial cancers). In the present study, we evaluated xenoestrogenic effect of bisphenol A (BPA) and antiproliferative activity of genistein (GEN) in accordance with the influence on this crosstalk. The gene expressions in mRNA and protein levels were examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, in which the primers for ERa, IGF-1R, and GAPDH and the antibodies against pIRS-1, pAkt, and GAPDH were used, respectively. Total RNA and protein samples were isolated from BG-1 cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), estradiol (E2; 10 -9 M), BPA (10 -5 M), E2 (10 -9 M)+GEN (10 -4 M), and BPA (10 -5 M)+GEN (10 -4 M). The DMSO was used a vehicle of E2, BPA, and GEN in in vitro experiments. All in vitro experiments were done in triplicates. The effects on tumour growth and immunohistologic alterations were identified in in vivo mouse models. The mice were injected subcutaneously with corn oil (vehicle, n=6), E2 (n=6), BPA (n=6), E2+GEN (n=6), and BPA+GEN (n=6) for 8 weeks. The BPA treatment resulted in up-regulation of ERa and IGF- 1R mRNA, and induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt proteins compared with a control (DMSO) in BG-1 ovarian cancer cells as E2 did in triplicates. In the mouse model xenografted with BG-1 cells, BPA significantly increased a tumour burden of mice and expressions of ERa, pIRS-1, and cyclin D1 in tumour mass compared with the vehicle (corn oil), indicating that BPA induces ovarian cancer growth by promoting the crosstalk between ER and IGF-1R signals. On the other hand, GEN effectively reversed estrogenicity of BPA by reversing mRNA and protein expressions of ERa, IGF-1R, pIRS-1, and pAkt induced by BPA in cellular model with triplicates. The GEN also significantly decreased tumour growth and in vivo expressions of ERa, pIRS-1, and pAkt in a xenografted mouse model. Also, GEN was confirmed to have an antiproliferative effect by inducing apoptotic signaling cascades. Taken together, these results suggest that GEN effectively reversed the increased proliferation of BG-1 ovarian cancer by suppressing the crosstalk between ER and IGF-1R signaling pathways up-regulated by BPA or E2.",NA,"*ovary cancer *cancer cell *in vitro study *xenograft *mouse *mouse model *embryo transfer *society neoplasm phosphorylation antiproliferative activity endometrium cancer breast model protein expression cancer growth hormonal therapy upregulation Western blotting gene expression *4,4' isopropylidenediphenol *phytoestrogen *genistein *estrogen receptor *somatomedin C receptor messenger RNA insulin receptor substrate 1 protein corn oil estrogen dimethyl sulfoxide receptor cycline protein kinase B estradiol somatomedin C antibody RNA","176-177","26","2014",-1

Dietary fatty acid profile has an essential function as an immune system regulator. Thymus is a biological marker of nutritional disorders(1). The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of diets containing high fat levels from different dietary sources on thymus weight, total number of thymocytes, and fatty acid composition of the thymus in adult rats. Wistar rats (n = 18; 50 days of age) were divided into three groups and fed during 40 days with diets containing 1) 50 kcal% fat provided by butter (group B), 2) 50 kcal% fat provided by sunflower oil (group S) and 3) normocaloric diet provided by soy oil (group C). All diets had 20% protein (casein) and were complete in all other nutrients according to AIN 93. Dietary fatty acid profile was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and w6/w3 and unsaturated/saturated (U/S) ratios were calculated. At the end of the feeding period, animals were sacrificed and thymus was removed. Thymus weights (TW), total number of thymocytes (NC) and fatty acid profile of thymus were determined.

Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are known risk factors for both ovarian and breast cancers. Previously, our lab has discovered that prepubertal dietary exposure to genistein reduced 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary incidence (P = 0.029) and aggressiveness of the tumors (P < 0.001) in the WT mice, and upregulated the expression of BRCA1 in their mammary glands (P = 0.04). In this study, we investigated whether prepubertal dietary exposure to genistein reduces ovarian tumors in heterozygous BRCA+/- mice and their wild type littermates. Mice were fed a control diet AIN93G or 500 ppm genistein-supplemented diet from postnatal day (PND) 15 to PND 30, and thereafter mice received the control AIN93G diet. On PND42, control and genistein mice were primed with medroxyprogesterone acetate and, starting at PND50, administered 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) once a week for four weeks. Ovarian tissues were harvested at 5 months of age. Histopathology assessment shows that mice developed granulosa cell tumors. Ovarian tumor incidence in control diet fed wildtype mice was 80% and in the BRCA+/- mice 100%. The incidence dropped to 33% in the wildtype and to 50% in the BRCA+/- mice following prepubertal genistein intake. Thus, the exposure to prepubertal genistein in both BRCA+/- and WT mice significantly reduced ovarian tumor incidence, compared with their control diet fed littermates (P=0.001). The mechanisms mediating the protective effect of prepubertal genistein intake on ovarian cancer risk are being investigated.",NA,"*ovary cancer *cancer risk *mouse *cancer research diet ovary tumor exposure neoplasm cancer incidence granulosa cell tumor histopathology tissues wild type mutation mammary gland aggressiveness breast cancer risk factor gene *genistein medroxyprogesterone acetate 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene isoflavone",NA,"73","2013",-1

Estrogen-induced oxidative stress has been implicated in this carcinogenic process. Resveratrol, a natural antioxidant phytoestrogen has chemopreventive effects against a variety of illnesses including cancer. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mechanism of resveratrol-mediated protection against estrogen-induced breast carcinogenesis. Female ACI rats were treated with 17beta-estradiol (E2), resveratrol, and resveratrol + E2 for 8 months. Co-treatment of rats with resveratrol + E2 significantly increased tumor latency and reduced E2-induced breast tumor development. Resveratrol treatment upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) expression and inhibited E2-mediated changes in activities of antioxidant enzymes in the mammary tissues. Resveratrol upregulated NRF2-regulated antioxidant genes NQO1, SOD3, and OGG1 a gene involved in protection against oxidative DNA damage. Resveratrol also prevented E2-mediated inhibition of detoxification genes flavin monooxygenase 1, aldehyde oxidase 1 and monoamine oxidase b1. Resveratrol treatment upregulated NRF2 expression by inhibiting E2-mediated alterations in NRF2 promoter methylation pattern and by reverting E2-mediated increased expression of NRF2 targeting micoRNA miR-93. Resveratrol treatment induced apoptosis and inhibited E2-mediated increase in 8-OHdG levels, a marker of oxidative DNA damage. Decreased colony formation, mammosphere formation and cell migration in resveratrol-treated MCF-10A cells further suggest protective role of resveratrol against E2-induced mammary carcinogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that resveratrol inhibits E2-induced breast carcinogenesis through inhibition of oxidative stress and activation of NRF2-mediated protective pathways.",NA,"*oxidative stress *breast carcinogenesis *cancer research gene protection DNA damage neoplasm breast tumor latent period rat promoter region August Copenhagen Irish rat apoptosis colony formation cell migration carcinogenesis breast cancer detoxification female diseases breast methylation etiology *estrogen *resveratrol antioxidant estradiol unspecific monooxygenase quercetin amine oxidase (flavin containing) phytoestrogen enzyme aldehyde oxidase transcription factor Nrf2 marker DNA",NA,"73","2013",-1

Hyder","Complex effects of dietary apigenin on prevention of MPA-accelerated DMBA-induced mammary tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats","Epidemiological and laboratory studies support the use of the plant-derived flavonoid apigenin as a potential nutraceutical for preventing a number of different cancers. However the effect of dietary apigenin on prevention of progestin-accelerated breast tumors has hitherto not been explored. Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) is the most commonly used synthetic progestin administered to post-menopausal women for hormone replacement therapy. MPA accelerates the development of breast cancers by reducing tumor latency and increasing tumor incidence and multiplicity in a DMBA-induced breast cancer model, and causes progression of human cancer cells in xenografts (Clin Can Res, 2006, 12:4062; Cancer Res, 2007, 67: 9929). Previously we showed that intraperitoneally administered apigenin effectively treated and prevented the progression of MPA-accelerated breast cancer in both the DMBA-induced, and xenograft mammary cancer models (Cancer Prev Res, 2011, 4: 1316; Horm Canc, 2012, 3: 160). In the present study we used the DMBA model to examine the chemopreventive effect of dietary apigenin against MPA-accelerated tumors. Based on reports in the literature, we examined the effects of feeding 3 different dietary levels of apigenin (0.02%, 0.1% and 0.5% wt/wt) in a phytoestrogen-free diet following treatment with DMBA, and prior to implantation of MPA pellets which accelerate tumor development. The MPA-dependent tumor incidence was lower in the 0.1% dietary apigenin treatment group. Surprisingly, the same dietary level significantly increased tumor multiplicity in those animals that developed tumors. A five-fold increase (0.5%) or reduction (0.02%) in dietary apigenin failed to reduce MPA-dependent tumor incidence and the higher dose (0.5%) substantially increased tumor multiplicity compared with MPA alone. Tumor incidence and multiplicity were unaffected in apigenin-fed animals that were treated with DMBA but supplemented with placebo pellets. There were no morphological or histological differences between tumors from animals fed apigenin-supplemented diets and those given a control diet, either in the presence or absence of MPA.These findings show that apigenin, given in a diet devoid of phytochemicals, exacerbated the effects of MPA on tumor development and multiplicity in a chemically-induced breast cancer model. Consequently, until further research clarifies the effect of dietary apigenin on progestin-accelerated tumors, caution should be exercised when considering the flavonoid as a dietary supplement for preventing hormone-dependent breast cancer.

Soy isoflavones are present predominantly as glucosides but when combined with beta-glucosidase activity in almond meal, a greater conversion to aglycones has been observed. We hypothesized that soy bread will serve as an excellent source of soy polyphenols and that an aglycone-rich soy-almond bread (SAB) compared to a glycoside-rich soy bread (SB) will demonstrate greater bioavailability of soy isoflavones. Methods: SB and SAB were fed in a 20 week randomized phase II cross-over trial involving 32 men with asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and escalating prostate specific antigen (PSA). Isoflavones were quantitated by HPLC in soy breads and isoflavone metabolites in 24h urine. HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry evaluated isoflavone pharmacokinetics in plasma. Biomarkers were determined by chemiluminescence-based assays. Results: The aglycone composition in the SB and SAB was 18% and 78%, respectively. Compliance was 95+14%, toxicity rare and limited to grade I GI complaints (NIH-NCI criteria). Urinary isoflavone patterns over 24hours revealed that isoflavonoid metabolites were significantly greater with soy bread consumption. Plasma pharmacokinetics following a test meal showed that daidzein (p=0.028) and genistein (p=0.010) absorption was significantly faster from the aglycone-rich SAB. Interestingly, PSA doubling time was prolonged compared to pre-enrollment, in 60% of men (n=30) with soy intervention. Conclusions: Bread is an excellent vehicle for the delivery of soy phytochemicals with outstanding compliance. Modification of soy bread with a source of beta-glucosidase may enhance the initial absorption rates of isoflavones.

We have investigated the effect of a high thoracic dose of radiation combined with soy isoflavones in a pre-clinical model of orthotopic A549 human lung carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Mice bearing established lung tumors (>300mum) were pretreated with soy for 3 days starting day 15 after A549 cell injection, and then received 10 Gy irradiation administered to the whole lung. Soy treatment, given orally at 1mg/day (50mg/kg) was continued for 5 days per week for 4 more weeks, then lungs were perfused with formalin and processed for histology. The effect of the therapy on the tumor cells, the surrounding tumor microenvironment and lung tissue structures was further analyzed using novel immunostaining and quantitative techniques. Compared to large invasive lung tumor nodules (up to 1-2 x 106 mum2) in untreated mice, the combined therapy caused a significant inhibition of tumor progression in lungs resulting in few residual small tumor nodules (0.02-0.07 x 106 mum2, p<0.05) with a low index of proliferation (mean of 16 positive nuclei for Ki-67 compared to 147 in control tumors, p<0.001). Pneumonitis was evaluated by morphometric measurements of the thickness of alveolar septa on H&E stained lung tissue sections. Soy isoflavones reduced the extent of pneumonitis induced by radiation resulting in 30% of the lung tissue with thickened septa compared to 45% observed in lungs treated with radiation only. Fibrosis staining using Masson's Trichrome revealed that radiation caused a dramatic increase in collagen fibers supporting the vessel and bronchiole walls and this effect was mitigated by soy isoflavones. Triple immunofluorescent staining of lung vessel walls was performed on lung tissue sections using antibodies specific to endothelial cells (anti-CD31), pericytes (anti-SMA) and collagen (anti-collagen IV). This technique revealed that soy isoflavones combined with radiation decreased the fraction of vessels with damaged basement membrane to 25% down from 42% in radiation-alone treated lungs. Thus, these studies demonstrate a differential effect of soy isoflavones on augmenting tumor destruction induced by radiation while acting as radioprotectors for the surrounding lung tissue. Soy isoflavones reduced pneumonitis and fibrosis, and preserved the integrity of lung structures including alveolar septa, bronchioles and vessels, probably by mitigation of the inflammatory response induced by radiation. Complementing cancer radiotherapy with soy isoflavones has the potential to improve its effectiveness on the tumor target and reduce dose-limiting radiotoxicity to the normal lung and could be applied in the treatment of advanced stage NSCLC.",NA,"*lung tumor *radiation *injury *lung parenchyma *cancer research *radiotherapy lung neoplasm pneumonia fibrosis tissue section lung alveolus wall bronchiole human mouse therapy nude mouse xenograft lung carcinoma thickness staining immunofluorescence test immunohistochemistry lung non small cell cancer tumor cell tumor microenvironment tissue structure cancer radiotherapy tumor growth inflammation lung structure histology pericyte endothelium cell irradiation blood vessel wall lung blood vessel basement membrane injection model isoflavone derivative collagen fiber formaldehyde collagen type 4 collagen antibody",NA,"73","2013",-1

Bhat","ARSHA, a novel analog of resveratrol inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cells by modulating expressions of ERalpha and ERbeta","Epidemiologic evidence suggests that diets rich in phytoestrogens are associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Resveratrol, a bioflavonoid found naturally in grapes, has been very effective as an antiproliferative agent in vitro. However, its poor bioavailability and rapid metabolism limits its use as a preferred anticancer agent. The problem of poor bioavailability of resveratrol can be solved by the synthesis of its analogs with appropriate chemical modifications that would enhance the stability and anticancer potency of resveratrol. To achieve this objective, we have synthesized a library of resveratrol analogs that resemble the basic skeleton of resveratrol but have structural modifications. These novel analogs were screened for their potential to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells. One analog, namely, ARSHA showed better potential and selectivity in inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Our next goal was to identify the mechanism by which ARSHA specifically inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells. Estrogen receptor (ER) expressing cell lines MCF-7 and T47D, and ER negative cell line MDA-MB-231 as well as ERbeta-transfected cell line MDA-MB-231 were treated with 50muM doses of ARSHA for upto 72 hours. mRNA and protein was isolated from respective cell lines. Real-time PCR and western blot analyses were performed. ARSHA significantly induced the expression of ERbeta (~3-fold) and inhibited the expression of ERalpha (0.2-fold) compared to vehicle treated controls. Taken together, our findings indicate that novel resveratrol analog ARSHA may inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines by inhibiting the expression of ERalpha and inducing the expression of ERbeta. Estrogen receptor alpha acts as a mediator of proliferation while ERbeta acts as an inhibitor of estrogen signaling.",NA,"*breast cancer *cancer cell *cancer research cell line bioavailability grape skeleton chemical modification risk synthesis library cancer cell culture metabolism Western blotting real time polymerase chain reaction in vitro study diet *resveratrol estrogen receptor bioflavonoid estrogen antineoplastic agent phytoestrogen messenger RNA protein",NA,"73","2013",-1

Williams","Coexposure to phytoestrogens and bisphenol a mimics estrogenic effects in an additive manner","Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDC) are abundant in our environment. A number of EDCs, including bisphenol A (BPA) can bind to the estrogen receptors (ER), ERalpha and ERbeta, and may contribute to estrogen-linked diseases such as breast cancer. Early exposure is of particular concern; many EDCs cross the placenta and infants have measurable levels of, eg, BPA. In addition, infants are frequently fed soy-based formula (SF) that contains phytoestrogens. Effects of combined exposure to xeno- and phytoestrogens are poorly studied. Here, we extensively compared to what extent BPA, genistein, and an extract of infant SF mimic estrogeninduced gene transcription and cell proliferation. We investigated ligand-specific effects on ER activation in HeLa-ERalpha and ERbeta reporter cells; on proliferation, genome-wide gene regulation and non-ER-mediated effects in MCF7 breast cancer cells; and how coexposure influenced these effects. The biological relevance was explored using enrichment analyses of differentially regulated genes and clustering with clinical breast cancer profiles. We demonstrate that coexposure to BPA and genistein, or SF, results in increased functional and transcriptional estrogenic effects. Using statistical modeling, we determine that BPA and phytoestrogens act in an additive manner. The proliferative and transcriptional effects of the tested compounds mimic those of 17beta-estradiol, and are abolished by cotreatment with an ER antagonist. Gene expression profiles induced by each compound clustered with poor prognosis breast cancer, indicating that exposure may adversely affect breast cancer prognosis. This study accentuates that coexposure to BPA and soy-based phytoestrogens results in additive estrogenic effects, and may contribute to estrogen-linked diseases, including breast cancer.

Ma","Adult exposure to a soy-rich diet promotes mammary tumor development in MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice through induction of ER-erbB-2 crosstalk","The impact of soy and soy isoflavones, such as genistein, on breast cancer risk remains controversial. Although meta-analysis of multiple studies suggests that soy intake may be associated with a small reduction in breast cancer risk, increasing reports show that soy/genistein may be deleterious to breast cancer under certain conditions. Therefore, it is urgent to identify the factors that may affect the safety and risk of soy/genistein on breast cancer. We tackled this clinically relevant problem by examining the effect of adult exposure to soy/genistein on a subgroup of breast cancers that are positive for both estrogen receptor (ER) and erbB-2. erbB-2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer. ER+/erbB-2+ breast cancer accounts for ~15-20% of breast cancer. Available data suggest that low dose soy/genistein stimulates ER+ breast cancer cells. On the other hand, genistein, a well known tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may inhibit erbB-2 overexpressing cells. The effect soy/genistein on ER+/erbB-2+ breast cancer is a dilemmatic question to be addressed. In this study MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic mice fed an AIN-93G diet were switched to a soy-rich diet (Purina 5001) at 20 weeks of age. Mammary tumor development in these mice was compared to that in control mice on a lifelong AIN-93G diet. We found that the adult switch to a soy diet accelerated mammary tumor development in this model. Average tumor latency for the control and soy-exposed groups were 36 and 32 weeks, respectively. Whole mount analysis indicated that the soy-diet-switch induced proliferation in the mammary glands as indicated by increased BrdU incorporation and epithelial density. We also found that changes in signaling of ER and erbB-2 pathways were modest at 24 weeks but more evident at 32 weeks. The soy-diet-switch induced ERalpha expression and phosphorylation which led to increased expression of ER target genes, including c-myc, cyclin D1, and Bcl-2. These changes were accompanied by increased phosphorylation/activation of EGFR, erbB-2, erbB-3, AKT1, and ERK1/2;. Expression of EGFR and erbB-3 was also increased. Although the mammary tumors developed in this model were ER negative, mammary epithelial cells in the premalignant tissues were ER+/erbB-2+. These results provide in vivo evidence that the soy-rich diet stimulates the proliferation of ER+/erbB-2+ mammary epithelial cells, suggesting that soy/genistein-associated estrogenic activity overrides its tyrosine kinase inhibitor activity, possibly through ER-erbB-2 crosstalk. Our data suggests that ER+/erbB-2+ breast cancer might be particularly vulnerable to the risk associated with adult exposure to soy/genistein, and therefore patients with ER+/erbB-2+ tumors should be alerted.",NA,"*exposure *adult *breast tumor *diet *transgenic mouse *cancer research *mouse breast cancer breast epithelium neoplasm cancer risk model risk low drug dose cancer cell oncogene c myc phosphorylation density safety meta analysis mammary gland latent period gene human tissues patient protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein cycline protein tyrosine kinase estrogen receptor broxuridine isoflavone derivative",NA,"73","2013",1

Phase I clinical studies of 2 novel isoflavonoid investigational drugs, ME-143 and ME-344 have been shown them to be generally well tolerated in patients with solid tumors. ME-143, a next analogue of the investigational anti-cancer drug Phenoxodiol binds at low nanomolar concentrations to a tumor-specific variant of cell surface associated NADH oxidase (tNOX), resulting in caspase activation and apoptotic tumor cell death. ME-344, a second investigational anti-cancer isoflavonoid, is structurally related to ME-143 but functionally distinct. ME-344 is a mitochondrial targeting agent that interferes with tumor cell energy generation resulting in cell death via mitochondrial membrane destabilization and autophagy induction through the disruption of both mTOR1 and mTOR2 upstream and downstream signal transduction pathways. Pre-clinical studies using in vitro cell lines showed significantly high potency for both compounds either when used as single agents or when combined with cytotoxic and targeted anti-cancer agents. The present study investigated the ex vivo efficacy of ME-143 and ME-344 using patient-derived tumor cells from triple negative breast cancer. Tumor tissue was disintegrated into single cell suspension and expanded in mouse as subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft before harvesting for the studies. Mouse tumor cells were disintegrated into single cells and were grown as spheroids to mimic the tumor micro-environment and single agent as well as combination treatments were performed. Using a high content imaging platform, various endpoints were evaluated to compare the efficacies of the drugs. Both ME-143 and ME-344 as single agents showed efficacy in inhibiting cell proliferation as well as colony formation in patient-derived triple negative breast cancer cells while combination of these agents with Cisplatin and Gemcitabine demonstrated additive or synergistic effects.

JCO 2011). Two subsequent studies confirmed this finding. In order to provide more insight into this association, we investigated whether enterolactone concentrations are affected by other lifestyle factors and tumor characteristics and whether the association might be restricted to subgroups defined by these factors. Methods: To increase study power, we additionally measured enterolactone concentration in patients of the second study center of the two-center MARIEplus study. The 1,990 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, aged 50-74 years and diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 in Germany, were prospectively followed up until end of 2009. Vital status was assessed via local population registries, deaths were verified by death certificates. Information on the clinical course and treatment was collected and verified by clinical records. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for post-diagnostic enterolactone levels in relation to overall survival (OS) were estimated using delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and study center and adjusted for prognostic factors. Potential differential effects by hormone receptor status, HER2 status, tumor characteristics, and lifestyle factors such as BMI, physical activity and smoking, were assessed. Results: Overall 257 patients had died. Median follow-up time from recruitment to death or censoring was 5.4 years. Median enterolactone levels for deceased and non-deceased patients were 17.3 and 20.8 nmol/L, respectively. Patients with high enterolactone levels were more likely to have tumors of smaller size, lower grade, hormone receptor expression positive and screen-detected, and to be HRT users, of normal weight and non-/former smokers and had not received chemotherapy. High enterolactone levels were associated with better OS (highest, Q4, vs. lowest quartile, Q1, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.90). Per 10 nmol/L increment, HR was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.98). In subgroup analysis, we found a stronger inverse association with estrogen receptor (ER) negative tumors (Q4 vs. Q1, HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16-0.93) than with ER positive tumors (HR 0.76, 0.46-1.25). Stronger associations were also observed in normal weight women (Q4 vs. Q1: HR 0.56, 0.35-0.90) than overweight women (HR 0.80, 0.36-1.75), in more active (HR 0.54, 0.33-0.90) than less active women (HR 0.78, 0.39-1.58) and in current smokers (HR 0.35, 0.14-0.89) than non-smokers/former smokers (HR 0.72, 0.46-1.13). However, subgroup differences were not statistically significant.

Complementary/Alternative medicine is increasingly being practiced worldwide due to its safety beneficial therapeutic effects. We hypothesized that a super combination (SC) of known phytochemicals used at bioavailable levels could induce 100% killing of breast cancer (BC) cells without toxic effects on normal cells and that microarray analysis would identify potential genes for targeted therapy of BC. Mesenchymal Stems cells (MSC, control) and two BC cell lines were treated with six well established pro-apoptotic phytochemicals individually and in combination (super cocktail), at bioavailable levels. The compounds were ineffective individually. In combination, they significantly suppressed BC cell proliferation (>80%), inhibited migration and invasion, caused cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis resulting in 100% cell death. However, there were no deleterious effects on MSC cells used as control. Furthermore, the SC down-regulated the expression of PCNA, Rb, CDK4, BcL-2, SVV, and CD44 (metastasis inducing stem cell factor) in the BC cell lines. Microarray analysis revealed several differentially expressed key genes (PCNA, Rb, CDK4, Bcl-2, SVV, P53 and CD44) underpinning SC-promoted BC cell death and motility. Four unique genes were highly up-regulated (ARC, GADD45B, MYLIP and CDKN1C). This investigation indicates the potential for development of a highly effective phytochemical combination for breast cancer chemoprevention/chemotherapy. The novel over-expressed genes hold the potential for development as markers to follow efficacy of therapy.

Menopausal women use these products as an aide in healthy aging, including for the maintenance of cognitive function. The safety and efficacy of many of these commercial preparations remain unknown. Previous research in our lab found that treatment of ovariectomized (OVX) female Long-Evans rats with genistein impaired working memory in an operant delayed spatial alternation (DSA) task and response learning in a plus-maze, but enhanced place learning assessed in the plus-maze. The present study further examined the effects of isolated isoflavones on working memory and place learning by treating middle-aged (12-13. month old) OVX female Long-Evans rats with S-equol, the exclusive enantiomer produced by metabolism of daidzein in the mammalian gut. S-equol binds selectively to ERbeta with an affinity similar to that of genistein but has low transcriptional potency. For DSA testing, S-equol at 1.94, 0.97. mg, or 0. mg (sucrose control) was orally administered to animals daily, 30. min before behavioral testing, and again both 4 and 8. hours after the first treatment.

Understanding the mechanisms behind these steps is critical to enhancing the effectiveness of gene delivery. Polyplexes formed with poly(beta-amino ester)s (PBAEs) have been shown to effectively transfer DNA to various cell types, but the mechanism of their cellular uptake has not been identified. This is the first study to evaluate the uptake mechanism of PBAE polyplexes and the dependence of cellular uptake on the end group and molecular weight of the polymer. We synthesized three different analogues of PBAEs with the same base polymer poly(1,4-butanediol diacrylate-co-4-amino-1-butanol) (B4S4) but with small changes in the end group or molecular weight. We quantified the uptake and transfection efficiencies of the pDNA polyplexes formulated from these polymers in hard-to-transfect triple negative human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231). All polymers formed positively charged (10-17 mV) nanoparticles of ~200 nm in size. Cellular internalization of all three formulations was inhibited the most (60-90% decrease in cellular uptake) by blocking caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Greater inhibition was shown with polymers that had a 1-(3-aminopropyl)-4-methylpiperazine end group (E7) than the others with a 2-(3-aminopropylamino)-ethanol end group (E6) or higher molecular weight. However, caveolae-mediated endocytosis was generally not as efficient as clathrin-mediated endocytosis in leading to transfection. These findings indicate that PBAE polyplexes can be used to transfect triple negative human breast cancer cells and that small changes to the same base polymer can modulate their cellular uptake and transfection routes. 2013 American Chemical Society.",NA,"article *breast cancer *cancer cell caveola controlled study drug mechanism drug structure drug synthesis drug uptake endocytosis gene delivery system *genetic transfection human human cell hydrodynamics internalization molecular weight particle size zeta potential *1 (3 aminopropyl) 4 methylpiperazine/an [Drug Analysis] *1 (3 aminopropyl) 4 methylpiperazine/dv [Drug Development] *1 (3 aminopropyl) 4 methylpiperazine/pr [Pharmaceutics] *2 (3 aminopropylamino)ethanol/an [Drug Analysis] *2 (3 aminopropylamino)ethanol/dv [Drug Development] *2 (3 aminopropylamino)ethanol/pr [Pharmaceutics] *antineoplastic agent/an [Drug Analysis] *antineoplastic agent/dv [Drug Development] *antineoplastic agent/pr [Pharmaceutics] chlorpromazine clathrin genistein *poly(1,4 butanediol diacrylate co 4 amino 1 butanol)/an [Drug Analysis] *poly(1,4 butanediol diacrylate co 4 amino 1 butanol)/dv [Drug Development] *poly(1,4 butanediol diacrylate co 4 amino 1 butanol)/pr [Pharmaceutics] *poly(beta amino ester) derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *poly(beta amino ester) derivative/dv [Drug Development] *poly(beta amino ester) derivative/pr [Pharmaceutics] *polymer/an [Drug Analysis] *polymer/dv [Drug Development] *polymer/pr [Pharmaceutics] unclassified drug wortmannin","43-51","25","2014",-1

Anticancer activities were evaluated on three different cell lines (renal adenocarcinoma (TK-10), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and melanoma (UACC-62)) by sulphorhodamine B method. Qualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic composition have been observed between raw and processed dark beans that influence the antioxidant activity, mainly for germinated samples which show a decrease of antioxidant capacity. Although every assayed extracts decreased reactive oxygen species release and exhibited cytotoxicity activities on cancer cell lines, raw beans proved to be the most active in neuroprotective and antitumoral effects; this sample is especially rich in phenolic compounds, mainly anthocyanins. This study further demonstrated that phenolic composition of dark beans is related with cooking process and so with their neuroprotective and anticancer activity; cooking of dark beans improves their digestion and absorption at intestinal level, while maintaining its protective ability on oxidative process at cellular level. 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Vargas","Metabolic basis for thyroid hormone liver preconditioning: Upregulation of AMP-activated protein kinase signaling","The liver is a major organ responsible for most functions of cellular metabolism and a mediator between dietary and endogenous sources of energy for extrahepatic tissues. In this context, adenosine-monophosphate- (AMP-) activated protein kinase (AMPK) constitutes an intrahepatic energy sensor regulating physiological energy dynamics by limiting anabolism and stimulating catabolism, thus increasing ATP availability. This is achieved by mechanisms involving direct allosteric activation and reversible phosphorylation of AMPK, in response to signals such as energy status, serum insulin/glucagon ratio, nutritional stresses, pharmacological and natural compounds, and oxidative stress status. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) lead to cellular AMPK activation and downstream signaling under several experimental conditions. Thyroid hormone (L-3,3',5-triiodothyronine, T3) administration, a condition that enhances liver ROS generation, triggers the redox upregulation of cytoprotective proteins affording preconditioning against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) liver injury. Data discussed in this work suggest that T3-induced liver activation of AMPK may be of importance in the promotion of metabolic processes favouring energy supply for the induction and operation of preconditioning mechanisms. These include antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, repair or resynthesis of altered biomolecules, induction of the homeostatic acute-phase response, and stimulation of liver cell proliferation, which are required to cope with the damaging processes set in by IR. 2012 Luis A.

These results indicate that dietary supplementation with 300 mg/kg LA may enhance antioxidant capability and depress oxidative stress in broilers. 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue antioxidant activity article bird blood sampling broiler controlled study *diet supplementation enzyme activity leg muscle lipid peroxidation liver maize male nonhuman oxidative stress randomization soybean alpha tocopherol glutathione/ec [Endogenous Compound] glutathione peroxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound] malonaldehyde/ec [Endogenous Compound] superoxide dismutase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *thioctic acid","8476-8488","12","2011",-1

Dunn","Update on phase I/II breast cancer prevention trials","The greatest success in breast cancer prevention has been with two agents, tamoxifen and raloxifene, both of which are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in high-risk women. However, these agents are only effective in preventing a certain percentage of estrogen receptor-positive disease. New agents are needed to prevent invasive breast cancer in a broader population of women. Phase I/II clinical trials are conducted with the intent of investigating agent efficacy via surrogate endpoint biomarkers. They also allow us to refine the population that may benefit from a given intervention. In this article, we review the important components of early phase trials including study design, cohort, surrogate endpoint biomarkers, and the challenges of recruiting to prevention trials.

Eugenol (4-allyl-2 methoxyphenol) has been known to control cholesterol and triglycerides level, reducing the activity of cancer cell and enhancing immunity in the human body. Eugenol can also be found in the vegetable oil, such as soya been oil, peanut oil and so on. This paper presents the method by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with extracting method in the E. caryophyllata Thunb and Syringa vulgaris L and using a time-dependent cell culture with Eugenol (50 muM) from E. caryophyllata Thunb. It also shows the eugenol data of several kinds of vegetable by using such method and examines the anti-proliferation effect of eugenol isolated from the herb of E. caryophyllata Thunb. on cervical cancer cell lines.

Shuming et al","To evaluate the protective effects of dark soy sauce (DSS) against acrylamide (ACR)-induced neurotoxicity in rats, 60 adult Sprague Dawley female rats were given DSS (0.5ml/kg body weight/day) before, after, and during ACR treatment (10mg/kg body weight/day) for 8 weeks in total. Treatment only with ACR resulted in a significant increase in lipid peroxidation level, lactate dehydrogenase, and serum creatine kinase activity, but a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity in brain homogenate. Moreover, serum serotonin, corticosterone, 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyronine, and L-thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone, estradiol, progesterone, and plasma adrenaline decreased significantly in ACR rats. Treatment with DSS before, during, and after ACR treatment partially antagonized the effects induced by ACR. In conclusion, DSS exhibited a protective action against ACR-induced oxidative stress and biochemical perturbations in rats; and treatment with DSS during ACR exposure was more effective than after or before ACR treatment. 2009 Informa UK Ltd.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue article brain homogenate controlled study creatine kinase blood level drug mechanism enzyme activity female fluid intake hormone blood level lactate dehydrogenase blood level lipid peroxidation neuroprotection *neurotoxicity/pc [Prevention] nonhuman *oxidative stress priority journal rat soybean *acrylamide/to [Drug Toxicity] adrenalin/ec [Endogenous Compound] corticosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] creatine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] lactate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] levothyroxine/ec [Endogenous Compound] liothyronine/ec [Endogenous Compound] progesterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] serotonin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soybean oil superoxide dismutase/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyrotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","434-440","19","2009",-1

The present study tested the hypothesis that the neuroprotective actions of Rg1 involved activation of the IGF-IR signalling pathway in a rat model of Parkinson's disease, induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Experimental approach: Ovariectomized rats were infused unilaterally with 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle to lesion the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and treated with Rg1 (1.5 h after 6-OHDA injections) in the absence or presence of the IGF-IR antagonist JB-1 (1 h before Rg1 injections). The rotational behaviour induced by apomorphine and the dopamine content in the striatum were studied. Protein and gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter and Bcl-2 in the substantia nigra were also determined. Key results: Rg1 treatment ameliorated the rotational behaviour induced by apomorphine in our model of nigrostriatal injury. This effect was partly blocked by JB-1. 6-OHDA significantly decreased the dopamine content of the striatum and treatment with Rg1 reversed this decrease. Treatment with Rg1 of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats reduced neurotoxicity, as measured by tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter and Bcl-2 protein and gene level in the substantia nigra. These effects were abolished by JB-1. Conclusions and implications: These data provide the first evidence that Rg1 has neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in the 6-OHDA model of nigrostriatal injury and its actions might involve activation of the IGF-IR signalling pathway. 2009 The British Pharmacological Society.",NA,"animal behavior animal cell animal experiment animal model animal tissue article brain damage circling behavior controlled study corpus striatum *dopaminergic nerve cell female gene expression medial forebrain bundle *neuroprotection nigroneostriatal system nonhuman ovariectomy *Parkinson disease/pc [Prevention] priority journal protein expression rat signal transduction substantia nigra therapy effect treatment response apomorphine/ec [Endogenous Compound] dopamine transporter/ec [Endogenous Compound] *ginsenoside Rg 1/pd [Pharmacology] oxidopamine protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *somatomedin C receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] tyrosine 3 monooxygenase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","738-748","158","2009",-1

Squadrito","Genistein aglycone reverses glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and increases bone breaking strength in rats: A comparative study with alendronate","Background and purpose: Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) is the leading cause of secondary osteoporosis. Clinical evidence suggests a role for genistein aglycone in the treatment of post-menopausal osteopenia although proof of efficacy in comparison with currently available treatments is still lacking. To clarify this issue, we investigated the effects of genistein on bone compared with alendronate in experimental GIO. Experimental approach: A total of 28 female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. GIO was induced by daily injections of methylpredni/one (MP; 30 mgkg-1 s.c.) for 60 days. Sham GIO animals (Sham-MP) were injected daily with the MP vehicle. At the end of the osteoporosis development period, MP rats were randomized to receive: vehicle (n = 7), genistein aglycone (5 mgkg-1 s.c.; n = 7) or alendronate (0.03 mgkg-1 s.c.; n = 7). Treatment lasted 60 days. Sham-MP animals were treated with vehicle for an additional 60 days. At the beginning and at the end of treatments, animals were examined for bone mineral density and bone mineral content. Bone-alkaline phosphatase and carboxy-terminal collagen cross links were determined; femurs were removed and tested for breaking strength and histology. Key results: Genistein aglycone showed a greater increase in bone mineral density, bone mineral content and in breaking strength than alendronate and significantly increased bone-alkaline phosphatase (bone formation marker), reduced carboxy-terminal collagen cross links (bone resorption marker), compared with alendronate. Both treatments improved bone histology and the histological score. Conclusion and implications: The results strongly suggest that the genistein aglycone might be an alternative therapy for the management of secondary osteoporosis. 2009 The British Pharmacological Society.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment animal model animal tissue article bone density bone mineral *bone strength carboxy terminal sequence controlled study *dose time effect relation drug efficacy female *glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis/co [Complication] *glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] histopathology *morphometrics nonhuman osteolysis osteopenia/co [Complication] osteopenia/pc [Prevention] *osteoporosis/co [Complication] *osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] priority journal rat *alendronic acid/cm [Drug Comparison] *alendronic acid/pd [Pharmacology] *alendronic acid/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] alkaline phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] carboxy terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] collagen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein aglycone/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein aglycone/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] *glucocorticoid/pd [Pharmacology] methylprednisolone/pd [Pharmacology] methylprednisolone/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] unclassified drug","1287-1295","156","2009",-1

We investigated the memory-enhancing effects and the underlying mechanisms of soyasaponin I (soya-I), a major constituent of soy. Impaired learning and memory were induced by injecting ibotenic acid into the entorhinal cortex of adult rat brains. The effects of soya-I were evaluated by measuring behavioral tasks and neuronal regeneration of memory-deficient rats. Oral administration of soya-I exhibited significant memory-enhancing effects in the passive avoidance, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests. Soya-I also increased BrdU incorporation into the dentate gyrus and the number of cell types (GAD67, ChAT, and VGluT1) in the hippocampal region of memory-deficient rats, whereas the number of reactive microglia (OX42) decreased. The mechanism underlying memory improvement was assessed by detecting the differentiation and proliferation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) prepared from the embryonic hippocampus (E16) of timed-pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats using immunocytochemical staining and immunoblotting analysis. Addition of soya-I in the cultured NPCs significantly elevated the markers for cell proliferation (Ki-67) and neuronal differentiation (NeuN, TUJ1, and MAP2). Finally, soya-I increased neurite lengthening and the number of neurites during the differentiation of NPCs. Soya-I may improve hippocampal learning and memory impairment by promoting proliferation and differentiation of NPCs in the hippocampus through facilitation of neuronal regeneration and minimization of neuro-inflammation. 2013 Hong et al.",NA,"adult animal cell animal experiment animal model animal tissue article cell proliferation cell survival controlled study dentate gyrus dose response drug effect embryo hippocampus learning disorder male *memory disorder/dt [Drug Therapy] microglia Morris water maze test nerve cell differentiation nerve cell necrosis nerve fiber growth *nerve regeneration nervous system inflammation neural stem cell *neuroprotection nonhuman passive avoidance test protein expression rat spatial memory Y-maze test broxuridine cell marker/ec [Endogenous Compound] choline acetyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] glutamate decarboxylase 65/ec [Endogenous Compound] glutamate decarboxylase 67/ec [Endogenous Compound] ibotenic acid Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] microtubule associated protein 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] neuron specific nuclear protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein tuj1/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soyasaponin I/do [Drug Dose] *soyasaponin I/dt [Drug Therapy] *soyasaponin I/po [Oral Drug Administration] *soyasaponin I/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug vesicular glutamate transporter 1/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"8","2013",-1

The estrogenic effects of the prenylated flavonoids of Epimedium make it an attractive alternative for hormone replacement therapy. Here, we examined the therapeutic potential of the estrogenic herb extract of Epimedium brevicornum as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy in a breast cancer mouse model. To that end, athymic and ovariectomized female nude mice were subcutaneously injected into the mammary fat pads with MCF-7 breast cancer cells, randomly grouped and fed with soy-free feeds, alone or in combination with ethinyl estradiol or different doses of the estrogenic herb extract of E. brevicornum. Our findings demonstrate that unlike ethinyl estradiol, it did not promote the growth of breast cancer xenograft volume and weight, with the highest dose showing a significant reduction in growth and ERalpha protein content. Moreover, the extract increased uterine weight at the lowest dose, while higher doses had no effects. Put together, our data shows for the first time that despite the estrogenic activity of E. brevicornum, its action is largely tissue specific and dose-dependent. Our data on E. brevicornum presents in vivo evidence for its selective estrogen receptor modulator effect and warrants exploration of its use as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women.

Women's disadvantage is expressed by relatively worse mortality ranking vs men for all-cause, 15th vs 2nd/22 countries (2005), particularly all-cancer, 13th vs 2nd (2001); lower male:female ratios compared to EU-15 for all-cause (1.41:1 vs 1.66:1) and all-cancer (1.29:1 vs 1.77:1, 2005), breast cancer 21.8% above EU-15 vs prostate 30.4% below (2000); Israeli female-male life expectancy gap smaller than multinational averages, 4.17y vs 6.10y (2005), ratio 1.13:1 vs 1.26:1 (2000).

Yu","Soy and green tea intake protect against cervical cancer among Singapore Chinese","Background: Cervical cancer incidence is highest in developing countries in Asia and South America and is associated with relatively poor survival in these high-risk populations. Diet may influence susceptibility to and/or persistence of human papillomavirus infection, a necessary cause of cervical cancer. Soy isoflavones and green tea catechins have immunomodulating properties that may protect against cervical cancer. Methods: We investigated the relationship between soy, green tea and black tea intake and risk of cervical cancer in the well-established prospective population-based Singapore Chinese Health Study. Soy and tea consumption data were collected at baseline using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cervical cancer cases (n=257) were identified from 34,028 women followed for an average of 11.7 years. Proportional hazards regression methods were used to assess the associations between soy and tea intake and cervical cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adjusted for Papanicolaou (Pap) test history, education level, parity, use of oral contraceptives, and other potential confounders. Results: A statistically significant inverse association was observed for highest versus lowest soy intake and cervical cancer risk (HR=0.71; 95% CI:0.53, 0.96; p for trend=0.03). Consumption of green tea on a weekly or more frequent basis, compared to no tea intake was inversely associated with cervical cancer risk (HR=0.80; 95% CI:0.56, 1.14; p for trend=0.2). There was no association with black tea. We observed interacting effects for soy and green tea intake on risk of cervical cancer. The inverse association with soy intake was stronger among women who drank green tea (HR=0.42; 95% CI:0.25, 0.69; p for trend=0.001). No association was observed for soy intake among non-tea drinkers (p for interaction=0.01). Conclusions: We provide the first human evidence for individual, as well as synergistic protective effects of soy and green tea intake on risk of cervical cancer. These findings were independent of self-reported frequency of Pap testing and education level. Our findings support experimental evidence for immunomodulating effects of green tea catechins and soy isoflavones as a possible mechanism underlying the protective effect of these dietary factors on cervical cancer risk.",NA,"*uterine cervix cancer *Singapore *cancer prevention *tea cancer risk human risk female education survival hazard ratio South America cancer incidence Asia proportional hazards model developing country food frequency questionnaire health population confidence interval high risk population parity diet papillomavirus infection Papanicolaou test catechin isoflavone derivative oral contraceptive agent",NA,"4","2011",-1

Kim","Isoflavones from phytoestrogens and cervical cancer risk: A nested case-control study","Objective: The effect of soybean products in cervical cancer risk has not been investigated yet. To examine the association between soybean product intake and cervical cancer risk, we measured phytoestrogen biological markers in cervical cancer patients and non-cancer control patients. Methods: Among patients visit Ewha womans university hospital between October 2007 and October 2010, 143 cases and 143 matched controls as same age distribution were enrolled. The concentrations of the four biomarkers in the plasma samples were measured using time-resolved fluoro-immunoassay. Dose-response relationship was analyzed with restricted cubic spline method. Conditional and unconditional logistic regression models were used to compute the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: There are linear relationships between two isoflavones concentrations (daidzein, equol) and cervical cancer risk. As daidzein concentration increased by 100 nmol/L, cervical cancer risk significantly increases by 41.4%. (P=0.028) Compared with the reference group, cervical cancer risk increased significantly in higher concentration of daidzein(P=0.04), genistein(3rd and 4th quantile, P=0.03), enterolactone(3rd quantile, P=0.003).

Rosenberg","Association of early life factors with uterine fibroids in us black women","Background: A recent study identified soy formula, low childhood SES, and preterm birth as risk factors for uterine leiomyoma (UL) diagnosed by age 35. We examined the relation of early life factors, including maternal and intrauterine characteristics, to risk of self-reported UL. Methods: Data were derived from the Black Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study of black women aged 21-69 at baseline. Over a 12-year period (1997-2009), we followed 24,232 premenopausal women for incidence of UL. We used Cox models to compute rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), after adjusting for covariates. Results: During 194,803 person-years of follow-up, there were 6,929 incident cases of UL diagnosed by ultrasound (N=4,559) or surgery (N=2,370). While we did not find evidence for an association of UL with soy formula (RR=0.97, CI=0.82-1.14) or preterm birth (RR=1.01, CI=0.92-1.11), weak associations were found for being left-handed or ambidextrous (RR=1.11, CI=1.01-1.21), being a twin or triplet (RR=0.87, CI=0.72-1.05), and birth weight <2,000g after control for gestational age (RR=0.87, CI=0.72-1.04). Factors associated with UL among women age<35 included low parental education (RR=1.24, CI=1.01-1.54, neither vs. both parents completed high school), being the first-born child of a young mother (RR=1.19, CI=1.01-1.41, firstborn/ maternal age<20 vs. later-born/maternal age>30), and latitude of residence in childhood (RR=1.13, CI=0.99-1.28, northern vs. southern tier of US). Other factors examined but unrelated to UL included being breastfed, maternal smoking, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke before age 11.

A multi-centric population-based case-control study among postmenopausal women was used to evaluate the association of lignans and phytoestrogenrich foods with breast cancer risk. Dietary data was collected from 2,884 breast cancer cases and 5,509 controls using a validated food-frequency questionnaire with additional food items to record phytoestrogen content. Association was investigated using conditional logistic regression adjusted for relevant risk and confounding factors. Polytomous logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association by estrogen receptor status. Highconsumers and low-consumers of phytoestrogen-rich foods were compared to non-consumers. High consumption of soy beans and sunflower-/pumpkin seeds was associated with a statistically significant reduced breast cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 0.83 (95% CI = 0.70-0.97), and 0.86 (95% CI = 0.77-0.97), respectively. In addition, consumption of all soy products together showed a protective effect of OR = 0.89 (95% CI = 0.79-0.99) However, dietary intake of lignans was not associated with breast cancer risk. Results were not modified by estrogen receptor status.

With more women seeking safer alternatives to estrogen replacement therapy, plant-based therapies are being investigated. The present study reports the relief of vasomotor symptoms in peri - and postmenopausal women using soy extract equivalent to 64 g of total isoflavones (n = 16) and root powder of an Ayurvedic plant Glycyrrhiza glabra (Yashtimadhu) 2.5 g-with 3.5% glycerrhizic acid content (n = 12) given in a single oral dose for 12 weeks. The symptoms were graded at baseline as 100% and during post-therapy follow-up at 1 week, 1,2 and 3 months on a scale of nil to 100% by the women. Fourteen of the 16 women on soy isoflavones and 11/12 on Glycyrrhiza glabra showed 50% or more relief by the end of three months. Quality of Life (QOL), menopause-specific was assessed basally and at 3 months. Thirteen of the 16 women using soy isoflavones and 10/12 in the G.glabra group showed 50% or more improvement in their QOL scores. The majority of women participating in the trial showed a serendipitous finding viz. amelioration of fatigue & weakness. Routine biochemical and hormonal tests, done at baseline and at end of trial showed no significant change. Pap smear for vaginal hormonal cytology and pelvic sonography for endometrial thickness also showed no significant change. Overall, drug compliance was good, as confirmed by presence of detectable levels of genistein in plasma of study subjects at 1 and 3 months of the trial. This exploratory study thus suggests that there is not only a decrease in the vasomotor symptoms but also an improvement in QOL using phytoalternatives in menopausal women.",NA,"cytology echography endometrial thickness estrogen therapy fatigue female follow up *Glycyrrhiza glabra human *menopause Papanicolaou test patient compliance pelvis plant plasma postmenopause powder quality of life therapy weakness estrogen genistein glycyrrhizic acid *isoflavone derivative *phytoestrogen","1-8","43","2006",1

The following search terms were used: breast cancer, breast neoplasm, breast carcinoma, diet, food, eating habits, dietary patterns, factor analysis, and principal component analysis. Only studies that used factor analysis techniques and/or principal component analysis were eligible, and a total of 26 studies were included. The findings of these studies suggest the Mediterranean dietary pattern and diets composed largely of vegetables, fruit, fish, and soy are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. There was no evidence of an association between traditional dietary patterns and risk of breast cancer, and only one study showed a significant increase in risk associated with the Western dietary pattern.

Fennel is one of the herbals that are used for treatment of some diseases and it contains phytoestrogen with a protection effect on metabolic disorders [2]. The goal of this research was to find the therapeutic effect of fennel on endometrial thickness in PCO rats. In this research forty female rats divided into five equal groups were categorized in: 1) Control group: rats received jus food and water 2) Rats were gavaged by high dose fennel extract. 3) Rats were injected by Estradiol-Valerate for induction of PCOS, 4) Rats were injected by Estradiol-Valerate and treated with high dose fennel extract, 5) Rats were injected by Estradiol-Valerate and treated by low dose fennel extract. After one month, uterus were removed and prepared for microscopic studies. We determined the endometrial thickness and assayed it with SPSS. The results showed that endometrial thickness reduced in PCO group significantly but it increased in the PCO group that treated with fennel. There was not significantly difference in thickness of endometrial between control group and group treated with fennel. We know that the endometrial thickness is equally with pregnancy ratio [3]. And it reduced significantly in PCO group but fennel improved this reduction in that group and the high dose of fennel was more effective than low dose. We can suggest that fennel can be treat PCO although we need have more researches about that.",NA,"*rat *fennel *extraction *medicinal plant *female endometrial thickness drug megadose control group low drug dose anovulation metabolic disorder hyperandrogenism diseases protection thickness therapy effect implantation infertility food abortion uterus human pregnancy estradiol valerate phytoestrogen water","479","12","2013",-1

There is plenty of evidence indicating estrogenic activity of red clover-derived compounds. Serious fertility problems have been reported in animal models [1]. on the other hand, phytoestrogens (red clover) are a group of natural compounds that are used for the treatment of menopausal disorders. They have protective effects on disorders such as osteoporosis, cardiac risk factors or breast cancer [2]. In this study we aimed to clarify the total phenol content and ferric reducing power of both flowers and leaves hydroalcoholoic extracts of red clover. Additionally, the free radical scavenging potency of either parts hydroalcoholic extract was determined. The total phenol content of leaves extract was found significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of flowers. Moreover, the DPPH scavenging activities for flowers and leaves at corresponding concentrations were found as 43.44 and 22/29 %, respectively. Both extracts showed remarkable antioxidant capacity in ferric reducing assay. Our data suggest that in addition of having known estrogenic property, various parts of red clover contains compounds with antioxidant effects. Moreover, the hydroalcoholic extract of red clover might be considered as a reliable source of alternative hormone replacement agents with antioxidant property which is essentially needed in chronic disease in particular in elder humans or animals.",NA,"*red clover *medicinal plant flower plant leaf breast cancer animal model risk factor osteoporosis fertility legume diseases menopausal syndrome human plant chronic disease hormone substitution assay *phenol *free radical antioxidant phytoestrogen natural product","323","12","2013",-1

Kushi","Communicating individual level biomarker data to participant families in epidemiological studies","Background/Aims: The US Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Centers (BCERC) include studies of determinants of puberty in girls, with a focus on exposures to hormonally active agents (HAAs). Urine and serum biospecimens were collected to measure cotinine, phenols, phytoestrogens, phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pesticides, and perfluorinated compounds. Although individual results were not promised to the 440 families at the California site, staff felt there were ethical imperatives for providing them. Communicating technical results on a sensitive population (children) poses many challenges, particularly when health ramifications are not established. Therefore, we conducted focus groups with parents to gauge their level of interest in receiving individual results, to determine preferences for content of report-back materials and method of receipt, and to assess their understanding of biomonitoring. Methods: Four focus groups were held (one in Spanish) of 8-12 participants randomly recruited from the study cohort. Participants answered demographic and literacy questions and participated in a scripted discussion. The study team used the focus group results to design study-specific report-back materials. Results: Of the 35 attendees, 89% were female, with a mean age of 45. Participants overwhelmingly wanted to receive their daughters' biomonitoring results, even if little corresponding health information was available. Other dominant themes included preferences for seeing their daughter's levels compared to other girls in the study and to other cohorts, receiving detailed information on the chemicals, including sources and ways to limit exposure, and the opportunity to speak individually with investigators. Conclusion: Findings confirmed prior research regarding the value of involving study participants in the design process for reporting results from biomarker studies in order to best address the unique perspectives of each study population and circumstances.

Although phytoestrogens are often perceived safe, evidence for overall positive riskbenefit profile is inconclusive. Moreover, the chance to buy them by user's initiative does not facilitate surveys on their prevalence and pattern of use. Objective: To describe pattern of use and self-reported positive and negative perceptions of phytoestrogens in post-menopause. Methods: A questionnaire was administered to women who were buying food supplements containing phytoestrogens in 22 pharmacies located in the Bologna area (400,000 inhabitants). Questionnaire was structured into 3 sections: (a) socio-demographic; (b) pattern of use (e.g., duration and frequency of therapy), (b) perceived benefits and adverse events. Differences in positive and negative perceptions, between short-term (<1 year of treatment) and long-term users (C1 year of treatment) were assessed by standard chi-square test (p<0.05). Results: Data on 190 post-menopausal women (aged 38-77) were collected. Out of these, 35 %reported high level of cholesterol, 18 %hypertension, 11 % circulation disorders, and 4 % breast cancer diagnosis, before starting phytoestrogens. Women stated to use phytoestrogens to reduce hot flashes (79 %), insomnia (15 %),mood disturbances (14 %) and prevent osteoporosis (15 %). Themajority (59 %) took phytoestrogens routinely, whereas 28 %in 3-month cycles. In terms of therapy duration, 47 % of women were considered shorttermand 53 %long-termusers.Amongpositive perceptions, no differencewas found between groups for palpitation reduction (37 %of cases, p = 0.96) and mood improvement (51 %, p = 0.75); a slight difference was reported for hotflashes relief (68 % in short-term vs. 81 % in long-term users; p = 0.05). Negative perceptions were reported more frequently in the long-term group, but this difference was statistically significant only for edema (6 % in shorttermvs. 17 %in long-termusers; p = 0.03), and not for other effects: swelling sensation (10 vs. 21 %; p = 0.08), somnolence (7 vs. 10 %p = 0.60), fatigue (4 vs. 11 % p = 0.13). Conclusions: In the Bologna area, the pattern of use of phytoestrogens for menopausal symptoms is heterogeneous, and women overall find these substances to be beneficial, especially for relief of hot-flashes. Other positive perceptions, instead, seem to decrease with a long-term use. Negative perceptions with long-term therapy appear as estrogen-like effects.

Although plantbased diets including vegetarian and vegan diets are generally considered to be cancer protective, very few studies have directly addressed this question. Most large prospective observational studies show that vegetarian diets are at least modestly cancer protective (10%-12% reduction in overall cancer risk) although results for specific cancers are less clear. However, a broad body of evidence links specific plant foods such as fruits and vegetables, plant constituents such as fiber, antioxidants and other phytochemicals, and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight to reduced risk of cancer diagnosis and recurrence. Also, research links the consumption of meat, especially red and processed meats, to increased risk of several types of cancer. Vegetarian and vegan diets increase beneficial plant foods and plant constituents, eliminate the intake of red and processed meat, and aid in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.

Diet, lifestyle and other breast cancer risk factors were investigated using the selfadministered questionnaire and interview. Odds ratios (ORs) of BLS and soy isoflavone consumption for breast cancer incidence were independently and jointly estimated using a conditional logistic regression. The ORs of BLS consumption (>four times a week against < four times a week) was 0.65 and statistically significant (p = 0.048). The analysis of association between soy consumption and breast cancer incidence showed the more the isoflavone consumption is, the lower the odds of breast cancer becomes. Adjusted ORs for breast cancer in the second, the third and the fourth quartiles of soy consumption against the first quartile were 0.76, 0.53 and 0.48, respectively (trend test, p = 0.0002).

Materials and Methods: This case-control study compared the dietary patterns between 98 breast cancer patients and 103 age-matched controls. A questionnaire survey about 27 frequently consumed food items was conducted among 201 patients in a general surgical ward. Serum albumin, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels were also investigated. Results: Five dietary patterns were defined via the principle component analysis: the meat-fat, pickle-vegetable, sugar-fried food, soy, and coffee-egg patterns. For the meat-fat dietary pattern, the third quartile and fourth quartile were significantly associated with higher breast cancer risk than the first quartile and second quartile with an odds ratio of 2.86 [95% confidence interval (CI)=1.25-6.53] and 3.11 (95% CI=1.33-7.27) respectively; p=0.002. In addition, cooking with oil was reported significantly more often in the fourth meat-fat dietary pattern quartile, as shown by the responses to eight out of 12 questions about cooking methods. Conclusion: These results revealed that meat was associated with a higher breast cancer risk, and a high fat intake might play an important role in this association. 2013.",NA,"adult article *breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *breast cancer/et [Etiology] cancer incidence cancer risk cholesterol blood level coffee controlled study dietary intake egg *fat intake female food intake human major clinical study *meat principal component analysis questionnaire soybean milk Taiwan triacylglycerol blood level vegetable cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *fat serum albumin/ec [Endogenous Compound] sugar triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","233-238","25","2013",-1

An important mechanism leading to multidrug resistance (MDR) is the overexpression of the 170 kDa P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of membrane transporters, encoded by the MDR1 gene. Aiming to overcome MDR and due to the clinical failure of P-gp inhibitors, downregulation of MDR1 expression by small molecules has been studied as a possible cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.

Therefore, agents targeting the genetic and/or epigenetic machinery offer potential for the development of anticancer drugs. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that some common natural products [such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin, genistein, sulforaphane (SFN) and resveratrol] have anticancer properties through the mechanisms of altering epigenetic processes [including DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, microRNA (miRNA) regulation] and targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs). These bioactive compounds are able to revert epigenetic alterations in a variety of cancers in vitro and in vivo. They exert anticancer effects by targeting various signaling pathways related to the initiation, progression and metastasis of cancer. It appears that natural products hold great promise for cancer prevention and treatment by altering various epigenetic modifications.

MPA has been shown to accelerate the development of mammary tumors in a 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer animal model. Previously, we have shown that intraperitoneally administered apigenin effectively treated and prevented the progression of MPA-accelerated breast cancer in DMBA-induced and xenograft mammary cancer models. Here we used the DMBA model to examine the chemopreventive effect of dietary apigenin against MPA-accelerated tumors with 3 different levels of apigenin (0.02%, 0.1%, and 0.5% w/w) incorporated into a phytoestrogen-free diet. Results showed that 0.1% dietary apigenin reduced MPA-dependent tumor incidence; however, the same dietary level increased tumor multiplicity in animals that developed tumors. Neither 0.02% nor 0.5% dietary apigenin reduced MPA-dependent tumor incidence or latency, and tumor multiplicity increased significantly in response to 0.5% apigenin. These results contrast with previous chemopreventive effects observed when apigenin was administered intraperitoneally, suggesting that route of administration may influence its action. Consequently, until further research clarifies the effect of dietary apigenin on progestin-accelerated mammary tumors, caution should be exercised when considering the flavonoid as a dietary supplement for preventing hormone-dependent breast cancer. 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue antineoplastic activity article body weight *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] *cancer growth *cancer incidence chemoprophylaxis controlled study diet supplementation female histology *multiple cancer nonhuman protein expression rat tumor xenograft *7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/to [Drug Toxicity] *apigenin/dt [Drug Therapy] *apigenin/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *medroxyprogesterone acetate/to [Drug Toxicity] vasculotropin","1184-1191","65","2013",-1

Results indicate that ATG inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell growth by inducing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. ATG triggers the mitochondrial caspase-independent pathways, as indicated by changes in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, resulting in AIF and EndoG nuclear translocation. ATG increased cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by increasing p22phox/NADPH oxidase 1 interaction and decreasing glutathione level. ATG clearly increases the activation of p38 MAPK, but not JNK and ERK1/2. Antioxidant EUK-8 a synthetic catalytic superoxide and hydrogen peroxide scavenger significantly decreases ATG-mediated p38 activation and apoptosis. Blocking p38 with a specific inhibitor suppresses ATG-mediated Bcl-2 downregulation and apoptosis. Moreover ATG activates ATF-2 a transcription factor activated by p38 and then upregulates histone H3K9 trimethylation in the Bcl-2 gene promoter region, resulting in Bcl-2 downregulation.

Das","In-house preparation of lectin panel and detection of TN polyagglutination","Background: Lectins are obtained primarily from seeds and used in investigating RBC polyagglutination. Polyagglutinable RBCs are agglutinated by human adult sera, regardless of blood group, and are usually non-reactive with their autologous serum or serum from cord blood samples. Aims: Here we shared our experience of preparing in-house lectin panel and confirmation of polyagglutination (Tn) in a pregnant lady. Methods: In-house preparation of lectin: We prepared in-house lectins from seed extracts as discussed elsewhere. Raw seeds of Dolichos biflorus, Arachis, Hypogaea, Glycine max and Salvia sclarea were purchased from local seed market and processed into lectins. For Dolichos biflorus further processing and standardization was done to use this as a reagent that agglutinates only A1 and A1B red cells. Saline extracts of each seed were stored in refrigerator for further use. Results: Case report: A 25 years old pregnant lady, primigravida at term was admitted in a rural hospital with haemoglobin (Hb) 6.1 g/dl and was advised 2 units blood transfusion. The blood group of the patient was detected as 'O' positive. While performing minor crossmatch all whole blood units showed incompatibility. The patient was referred to our hospital which is a tertiary care organization with blood component facility. On investigation we found the patient's blood group as 'O' positive but her red cells strongly reacting (4+) with anti-A1 lectin and showing mixed field agglutination with anti-A and anti-A,B (Table 1). Antiglobulin test both direct and indirect were negative. Two units of compatible washed 'O' positive packed red blood cells (PRBC) were issued to the patient for transfusion. Because of minor incompatibility and patient's cells agglutinating with anti-A and anti-A1 we suspected polyagglutination and performed further investigations for confirmation. Six samples of fresh normal 'AB' group adult sera and three samples of cord blood sera were tested with the patient red cells at 22 and 4degreeC. The sera study confirmed the presence of polyagglutination as described in table 2. We used in house lectin panel to detect the type of polyagglutination. The agglutination pattern with various lectins was suggestive of Tn polyagglutination (Table 3). Papain treated polyagglutinable cells of the patient showed reduced agglutination strength (weak + to +) with the adult sera which is also supportive of Tn polyagglutination. Conclusion: Blood banks in India lack commercial lectin panels because of cost and procurement difficulty. The young pregnant lady was severely anaemic and instantly managed with compatible washed PRBCs. Lectin study was suggestive of Tn polyagglutination which was further supported by the enzyme test. Mixed field appearance with anti-A and anti-A,B was the result of mutant clone with normal hematopoietic tissue and the biochemical similarily of Tn antigen with group A determinant. We conclude that lectin panels can be easily developed in blood bank. The various raw seeds available in the market can be converted to lectins following the correct standard procedure and validation process. Lectins play an important role in the diagnosis and differentiation of polyagglutination and immunohematological management of the patient.

Most studies have examined risks associated with specific foods and nutrients, rather than measures of overall diet. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate dietary patterns and their relation to breast cancer risk in a large cohort of women. Design: Data from 91,779 women in the California Teachers Study cohort were analyzed, including data from 4140 women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer made between 1995 and 2009. Five predominant dietary patterns were identified by using principal components factor analysis: a plant-based diet, high in fruit and vegetables; a high-protein, high-fat diet, high in meats, eggs, fried foods, and high-fat condiments; a high-carbohydrate diet, high in convenience foods, pasta, and bread products; an ethnic diet, high in legumes, soy-based foods, rice, and dark-green leafy vegetables; and a salad and wine diet, high in lettuce, fish, wine, low-fat salad dressing, and coffee and tea. Results: The plant-based pattern was associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.95 for the highest compared with the lowest consumption quintile; P-trend = 0.003); risk reduction was greater for estrogen receptor-negative progesterone receptor-negative (ER-PR-) tumors (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.91; P-trend = 0.03). The salad and wine pattern was associated with an increased risk of estrogen receptor-positive progesterone receptor- positive tumors (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.49); this effect was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for alcohol consumption. Conclusion: The finding that greater consumption of a plant-based dietary pattern is associated with a reduced breast cancer risk, particularly for ER2PR2 tumors, offers a potential avenue for prevention. 2013 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"adult aged alcohol consumption apple apricot article banana bean beef berry bread *breast cancer broccoli Brussels sprout butter caloric intake *cancer risk cantaloupe carbohydrate diet carrot cauliflower chicken coffee cohort analysis *dietary intake egg estrogen receptor positive breast cancer ethnicity fat intake female fish food intake fruit grape human kiwifruit leafy vegetable legume lentil lettuce lipid diet low fat diet major clinical study meat mustard orange (fruit) pasta pea peach pork potato protein diet rice risk reduction soybean strawberry tea teacher tomato tumor invasion United States vegetable watermelon wine estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] margarine progesterone receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1524-1532","98","2013",-1

However, it is unclear whether the same reduction in risk associated with high soy intake is also applicable to familial or genetic breast cancer. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the dietary factors among carriers and noncarriers of BRCA mutations in the Korean Hereditary Breast Cancer Study (KOHBRA). Design: The KOHBRA Study is an ongoing project composed of affected breast cancer patients and familial members of breast cancer cases with BRCA mutations. To assess the association between dietary diversity and breast cancer risk, an HR was estimated by comparing affected subjects with their familial nonaffected members. To assess the interaction between the combination of BRCA mutation and diet diversity, the case-only OR (COR) was estimated by comparing BRCA mutation carriers and noncarriers only in affected subjects. Results: Soy product intake was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in carriers (HR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.79 for the highest quartile). The highest quartile of meat intake was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer regardless of BRCA mutation in carriers (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.13, 3.44) and noncarriers (95% CI: 1.41; 1.12, 1.78). The associations of meat intake and soybean intake for breast cancer were more prominent in BRCA2 mutation carriers. In the analysis with only cases, the highest quartile of soy intake, but not meat intake, was associated with BRCA-related breast cancer (COR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.91).

Purported EDCs in personal care products include 4-MBC (UV filter) or parabens that showed oestrogenic activity in screening tests, although regulatory toxicity studies showed no adverse effects on reproductive endpoints. Hormonal potency is the key issue of the safety of EDCs. Oestrogen-based drugs, e.g. the contraceptive pill or the synthetic oestrogen DES, possess potencies up to 7 orders of magnitude higher than those of PCP ingredients; yet, in utero exposure to these drugs did not adversely affect fertility or sexual organ development of offspring unless exposed to extreme doses. Additive effects of EDs are unlikely due to the multitude of mechanisms how substances may produce a hormone-like activity; even after uptake of different substances with a similar mode of action, the possibility of additive effects is reduced by different absorption, metabolism and kinetics. This is supported by a number of studies on mixtures of chemical EDCs. Overall, despite of 20 years of research a human health risk from exposure to low concentrations of exogenous chemical substances with weak hormone-like activities remains an unproven and unlikely hypothesis. 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,"adverse outcome article biological activity breast cancer cryptorchism del castillo syndrome disease association endocrine function environmental health estrogen activity health hazard hormone action human hypospadias hypothesis male fertility nonhuman priority journal reproductive toxicity risk assessment screening test spermatozoon count testis cancer testis disease 3 (4 methylbenzylidene)camphor 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol antiperspirant agent benzyl paraben beta hexachlorocyclohexane butyl paraben chemical compound coumestrol daidzein deodorant agent diethylstilbestrol *endocrine disruptor estradiol estrone ethinylestradiol genistein hormone derivative methoxychlor oral contraceptive agent phthalic acid phthalic acid dibutyl ester phthalic acid diethyl ester polychlorinated biphenyl propyl paraben","295-305","223","2013",-1

Joiner","Differential effect of soy isoflavones in enhancing high intensity radiotherapy and protecting lung tissue in a pre-clinical model of lung carcinoma","Background Radiotherapy of locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer is limited by radiation-induced pneumonitis and fibrosis. We have further investigated the role of soy isoflavones to improve the effect of a high intensity radiation and reduce lung damage in a pre-clinical lung tumor model. Methods Human A549 NSCLC cells were injected i.v. in nude mice to generate a large tumor burden in the lungs. Mice were treated with lung irradiation at 10 Gy and with oral soy. The therapy effect on the tumor cells and surrounding lung tissue was analyzed on lung sections stained with H&E, Ki-67 and Masson's Trichrome. Pneumonitis and vascular damage were evaluated by measurements of alveolar septa and immunofluorescent staining of vessel walls. Results Combined soy and radiation caused a significantly stronger inhibition of tumor progression compared to each modality alone in contrast to large invasive tumor nodules seen in control mice. At the same time, soy reduced radiation injury in lung tissue by decreasing pneumonitis, fibrosis and protecting alveolar septa, bronchioles and vessels. Conclusions These studies demonstrate a differential effect of soy isoflavones on augmenting tumor destruction induced by radiation while radioprotecting the normal lung tissue and support using soy to alleviate radiotoxicity in lung cancer. 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Stanga","Drug-food-and food-drug-interactions relevant for patients under PPI and aromatase inhibitor treatments: A shared responsibility for personalized nutritional and pharmacotherapy","Background and objectives: Food-food and food-drug interactions are emerging topics in literature and risk factors for ADE in practice. Substrates may modify absorption or interact with the 57 metabolizing CYP450 isoenzymes. The aim of this work is to describe relevant interactions outside the current interaction tables on absorption (PPI) and on CYP19A1 (aromatase inhibitors). Settings and method: 188 references froma systematic online literature research were evaluated. Nutritional and/or medication reconciliation options rely on a multidisciplinary focus group approach. Main outcome measures: Around 130 ingredients have been retrieved and listed. Results: PPIs change gastric pH permanently to>4.0, thus suppress gastric acid secretion and impair pepsin activation for cleavage of peptide bonds. This loss of acidity brings with it bacterial overgrowth, community or hospital acquired pneumonia (increased risk ratio of 1.89 in PPI patients), increase of asthma among children from mothers treated with PPI in pregnancy, mucosal degeneration/transmucosal leak/hyperpermeability, thus increase of drug availability (e.g. nifedipine, digoxin, penicillin's, erythromycin, or alendronate), and malabsorption, thus reduction of drug bioavailability (e.g. carboxylic or vinylogous carboxylic acids as a result of altered dissociation). Prevention options comprise allergenic food avoidance, buffering, pepsin replacement, peristalsis stimulation, and melatonin. Intervention may focus on nutrition and medication reconciliation. Inhibition of aromatase has been described for tea and soy, whole grains from buckwheat, millet, or brown and purple rice, cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower), grapefruit, grape seed oil, and mushrooms. Induction of aromatase can be associated with ethanol. Liquorice (glycyrrhizin) reduces serum testosterone in men and women and supports regular ovulation by induction of aromatase. Conclusions: Concise interaction tables do not explain extra-hepatic interactions. Inappropriate long-term PPI treatment is a documented risk factor for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal degeneration, hyperpermeability, and altered bioavailability.

The potential characteristics of these carrier controlled by amiphiles are particle size, encapsulation efficiency, stability and controlled release.Paclitaxel(PTX) is anticancer drug used widely in various carcinomas. The present study was undertaken to establish the optimum concentration of ampiphiles in the development of SLN loaded with PTX by microemulsification technique. In this study 32 Full Factorial Design was employed for optimizing the concentration surfactant and co-surfactant for the nanoparticles. Soy lecithin was used as surfactant and Sodium taurocholate co- surfactant with shell composition of Stearic acid (SA) and Di-palmitoyle phosphotidylcholine (DpPc).The optimization of ampiphile concentration was done by studying dependent variables as particle size less than 200 nm, % encapsulation efficiency(% EE) of more than 75 percent. Total nine batches of drug loaded SLN were prepared with varying concentration of surfactant and co-surfactant. Results showed that SLN prepared with concentration of 20% of soy lecithin and 0.8% of sodium taurocholate produced the SLN with optimum characteristic as compared with other formulations. They showed particle size of 192 nm, and encapsulation efficiency of 81%.The In-Vitro release performance was found to be 69% drug released up to 48 hrs and better In-Vitro cytotoxicity in MCF7 breast cancer cell line.",NA,"article biochemical composition cancer cell culture cancer cell destruction cell death concentration (parameters) controlled study differential scanning calorimetry drug formulation drug release factorial design in vitro study infrared spectroscopy microemulsion nanoencapsulation particle size process optimization scanning electron microscopy zeta potential *amphophile cosurfactant dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine *paclitaxel/pr [Pharmaceutics] phosphatidylcholine *solid lipid nanoparticle stearic acid taurocholic acid","1166-1180","4","2013",-1

Methods: A total of 100 eligible Chinese women without osteoporosis, aged 45-65 (55.96+4.11) and menopaused for more than 2 years, were randomized 250 ml/day milk and 250 ml/day calcium fortified soymilk for 12 months. Participants were excluded if they used to drink cow milk or soymilk daily, had been diagnosed osteoporosis, had any conditions affecting bone metabolism, such as connective tissue disease, gastrointestinal diseases, hepatic disease, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, diabetes mellitus and so on. Women who had taken oral glucocorticoids, as well as any other medications known to affect bone mass, for 3 months prior to recruitment, were also excluded. Serum E2, PTH, PINP and 25(OH)D3 were examined at 0, 6 and 12 months. Results: The baseline status of serum E2,PTH,PINP and 25 (OH)D3 and characteristics of age, height, body weight, body surface area, BMI, time since menopause, status of physical activities, dietary calcium intake, smoking, drink with caffeine, alcohol consumption, and family medical history, and so on were very similar between the groups (P>0.05). As show, in Fig.1, PTH and PINP decreased significantly in both groups in the 12 months (P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in these changes between the two groups.

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT, -3 FA), fish oil, and olive oil are reported to decrease the inflammatory response. However, the effect of these lipids on the gastrointestinal tract has not been well studied. To address this, we used a mouse model of parenteral nutrition (PN) and hypothesized that a decrease in intestinal inflammation would be seen when either fish oil and MCT or olive oil were added. Methods: Three FEs were studied in adult C57BL/6 mice via intravenous cannulation: standard soybean-based FE (SBFE), 80% olive oil -supplemented FE (OOFE), or a combination of a soybean oil, MCT, olive oil, and fish oil emulsion (SMOF). PN was given for 7 days, small bowel mucosa-derived cytokines, animal survival rate, epithelial cell (EC) proliferation and apoptosis rates, intestinal barrier function and mucosal FA composition were analyzed. Results: Compared to the SBFE and SMOF groups, the best survival, highest EC proliferation and lowest EC apoptosis rates were observed in the OOFE group; and associated with the lowest levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1beta expression. Jejunal FA content showed higher levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acid in the SMOF group and the highest arachidonic acid in the OOFE group. Conclusion: The study showed that PN containing OOFE had beneficial effects to small bowel health and animal survival. Further investigation may help to enhance bowel integrity in patients restricted to PN. 2013 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment animal model apoptosis article cell proliferation cell survival controlled study enteritis intestine epithelium cell male mouse nonhuman *parenteral nutrition priority journal *small intestine mucosa survival rate turnover time arachidonic acid *clinoleic docosapentaenoic acid *fish oil *fish oil emulsion icosapentaenoic acid interleukin 1beta interleukin 6 *lipid emulsion medium chain triacylglycerol *soybean oil emulsion toll like receptor 4 tumor necrosis factor tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 unclassified drug","775-786","37","2013",-1

Over the past decade, several Notch pathway inhibitors have entered the initial stages of clinical trials as monotherapies. However, recent data have suggested that Notch pathway inhibitors are most effective when used in combination with conventional breast cancer therapies.

Soy food contains soy isoflavones, which belong to a class of plant compounds called phytoestrogen, and is postulated to have beneficial effects in reducing breast cancer risk. Using data from the Singapore Chinese Health Study, which is made up of 35,303 women and 27,959 men recruited between 1993 and 1998, we investigated the effects of soy intake on breast cancer risk among middle-aged and elderly Singapore Chinese women. Relative to postmenopausal women with lower (below median) soy intake, those with higher intake showed a statistically significant 18% reduction in risk. The inverse association between soy intake and breast cancer risk was apparent mainly in postmenopausal women. These prospective findings strengthen earlier observations from other Asian populations, and suggest that soy isoflavones may have lasting beneficial effects against breast cancer development. Furthermore, our case-control study on soy isoflavone intake, MDM2 gene polymorphism and breast cancer risk nested within this Singapore cohort suggests that soy isoflavones may act via the down-regulation of the MDM2 oncoprotein as one of its mechanistic anti-carcinogenic pathways in breast cancer.",NA,"*breast cancer *cancer risk *Singapore *Malaysia human female postmenopause population risk soybean aged middle aged male health developing country DNA polymorphism Asian case control study plant down regulation developed country neoplasm isoflavone derivative phytoestrogen isoflavone oncoprotein","S38-S38","42","2013",-1

A growing body of evidence suggests that BBI could act as anticarcinogenic agent and KTI is considered to prevent cancer invasion and metastasis. These inhibitors are non-Toxic, are of low cost and can be taken orally or as a part of the daily diet. PIs are undergoing investigation in the clinical setting as potential agents for chemoprevention and anti-metastasis.

Isoflavones are their most widely known category. There are different mechanisms of action of isoflavones accepted, although they may be considered as selective modulators of estrogen receptors. On the other hand, Cimicifuga Racemosa is a perennial plant used traditionally for problems related to menstruation. Its action mechanisms have not been totally identified. There is a growing interest in the usefulness of phytotherapy in the treatment of symptoms and menopause-related diseases.

Since the relevance of angiogenesis in gastrointestinal chronic inflammation and cancer has been demonstrated, inhibition of angiogenesis is an attractive strategy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Here, we attempt to identify phytochemical that contributes to the well-documented preventive effects of plant-based diets on cancer incidence and mortality. We describe biochanin A as a putative antiangiogenic phytochemical that inhibits angiogenesis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Treatment with 100 flM biochanin A inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced migration of HUVECs by up to 60% in a dose-dependent manner. VEGF-induced tube formation of HUVECs was also inhibited by biochanin A. In HUVECs, VEGF treatment increased phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). However, pretreatment of HUVECs with 100 muM biochanin A decreased phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. These results showed that biochanin A is, at least, a putative anti-angiogenic phytochemical that regulates the Akt-eNOS signaling pathway.

Varanda","Evaluation of Estrogenic Potential of Flavonoids Using a Recombinant Yeast Strain and MCF7/BUS Cell Proliferation Assay","Phytoestrogens are of interest because of their reported beneficial effects on many human maladies including cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Furthermore, there is a search for compounds with estrogenic activity that can replace estrogen in hormone replacement therapy during menopause, without the undesirable effects of estrogen, such as the elevation of breast cancer occurrence. Thus, the principal objective of this study was to assess the estrogenic activity of flavonoids with different hydroxylation patterns: quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, fisetin, chrysin, galangin, flavone, 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 7-hydroxyflavone via two different in vitro assays, the recombinant yeast assay (RYA) and the MCF-7 proliferation assay (E-screen), since the most potent phytoestrogens are members of the flavonoid family. In these assays, kaempferol was the only compound that showed ERalpha-dependent transcriptional activation activity by RYA, showing 6.74+1.7 nM EEQ, besides acting as a full agonist for the stimulation of proliferation of MCF-7/BUS cells. The other compounds did not show detectable levels of interaction with ER under the conditions used in the RYA. However, in the E-screen assay, compounds such as galangin, luteolin and fisetin also stimulated the proliferation of MCF-7/BUS cells, acting as partial agonists. In the evaluation of antiestrogenicity, the compounds quercetin, chrysin and 3-hydroxyflavone significantly inhibited the cell proliferation induced by 17-beta-estradiol in the E-screen assay, indicating that these compounds may act as estrogen receptor antagonists. Overall, it became clear in the assay results that the estrogenic activity of flavonoids was affected by small structural differences such as the number of hydroxyl groups, especially those on the B ring of the flavonoid. 2013 Resende et al.",NA,"antiestrogenicity article *assay BUS cell cell line cell proliferation *cell proliferation assay cell strain MCF 7 controlled study drug activity drug structure *estrogen activity fungal strain human human cell hydroxylation in vitro study nonhuman *recombinant yeast assay transcription initiation yeast 3 hydroxyflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 3 hydroxyflavone/cm [Drug Comparison] 3 hydroxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] 7 hydroxyflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 7 hydroxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] chrysin/an [Drug Analysis] chrysin/cm [Drug Comparison] chrysin/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor estrogen receptor alpha fisetin/an [Drug Analysis] fisetin/cm [Drug Comparison] fisetin/pd [Pharmacology] flavone/an [Drug Analysis] flavone/pd [Pharmacology] *flavonoid/an [Drug Analysis] *flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] galangin/an [Drug Analysis] galangin/cm [Drug Comparison] galangin/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxyl group kaempferol/an [Drug Analysis] kaempferol/cm [Drug Comparison] kaempferol/pd [Pharmacology] luteolin/an [Drug Analysis] luteolin/cm [Drug Comparison] luteolin/pd [Pharmacology] phytoestrogen primuletin/an [Drug Analysis] primuletin/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/an [Drug Analysis] quercetin/cm [Drug Comparison] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology]",NA,"8","2013",-1

This natural compound displays a wide array of biological activities, but it is best known for its ability to inhibit cancer progression, especially for hormone-related ones such as breast cancer. Genistein has been shown to bind both the estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and the estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), although it has a higher affinity for the ERbeta. The ERa/ERbeta ratio is a prognostic marker for breast tumors, and ERbeta expression could indicate the presence of tumors more benign in state, whereas ERa indicates malignant tumors. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of genistein on oxidative stress and mitochondrial functionality through its interaction with the estrogen receptor in breast cancer cell lines with different ERa/ERbeta ratios. The lower ERa/ERbeta ratio T47D cell line showed lower oxidative stress and greater mitochondrial functionality, along with an up-regulation of uncoupling protein 2 and sirtuins. On the other hand, genistein-treated MCF-7 cell line, with the highest ERa/ERbeta ratio, reported no changes for the control situation. On the whole, our results show different genistein effects depending on ERa/ERbeta ratio for oxidative stress regulation, mitochondrial functionality, and modulation of UCPs, antioxidant enzymes and sirtuins in breast cancer cell lines. Effects of genistein on oxidative stress and mitochondria could be due at least in part, to a higher ERbeta presence, but could also be due to up-regulation of ERbeta caused by the genistein treatment. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The proliferation effect of FPC were conducted on T47D cells In vitro by MTT test. T47D cells were treated with FPC alone (0.01-200 mumol/L) or in combination with TAM 20 nmol/L. Furthermore, the expression of ERalpha or c-Myc were also determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: The results indicated that administration of an anti-estrogen TAM showed growth inhibitory effect on T47D cells, wheraes co-administered with low concentration (less than 1 mumol/L) of FPC attenuated to promote cell proliferation. In contrast, the combination of TAM with higher doses (more than 20 mumol/L) of FPC showed growth inhibitory. This result was supported by immunocytochemistry studies that the administration of 20 nmol/L TAM down-regulated ER-alpha and c-Myc, but the combination of 20 nmol/L TAM and 1 mumol/L FPC robustly up-regulated expression of ER-alpha. Thus, the reduced growth inhibition of TAM 20 nmol/L by FPC 1 mumol/L on T47D cells may act via the modulation of ER-alpha. Conclusions: The findings indicate and suggest that FPC had estrogenic activity at low concentrations and anti-estrogenic effect that are likely to be regulated by c-Myc and estrogen receptors. We also confirm that low concentration of FPC attenuated the growth-inhibitory effects of TAM on mammary tumor prevention.

In a randomized clinical trial, we studied the effects of genistein on endothelial function in postmenopausalwomenwith metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods Twenty postmenopausal women with MS, according to modified NCEP-ATP III criteria were randomly assigned to receive placebo or genistein (54 mg/day) for 6 months, along with a Mediterranean-style diet. Postmenopausal women without MS (n = 15), served as controls. The primary goal was the assessment of endothelial function by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of brachial artery; moreover, time-to-peak dilation in the FMD response has been evaluated. Secondary outcomes were fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, visfatin, adiponectin and homocysteine blood levels. Data on adverse events were also recorded. Results After 6 months of treatment, FMD at 50s and peak FMD significantly increased in genistein recipients compared with placebo. Moreover, genistein significantly decreased the blood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, homocysteine and visfatin compared with placebo, while blood adiponectin levels were increased. Genistein recipients neither experienced more side-adverse effects than placebo nor discontinued the study.

However, the antithyroid components in soy are yet to be identified, and the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. This study examined if soy isoflavones affect iodine uptake and expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones in the Fischer rat thyroid cell line (FRTL-5). FRTL-5 cells were treated with Novasoy, a soy alcohol extract containing 30% isoflavones, or major isoflavone aglycones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein) or glycosides (genistin, daidzin, and glycitin) for 24 hrs. Iodide uptake was measured by a colorimetric assay. The protein content of thyroglobulin (Tg), sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) was measured by Western blotting. Cytotoxicity of tested compounds was determined by the MTT cell proliferation assay. Iodide uptake in FRTL-5 cells was dose-dependently suppressed by Novasoy (50, 100, or 200 mug/mL) added into the assay or to the cell culture (10, 25, or 50 mug/mL) (p < 0.05). However, neither the major isoflavone aglycones nor glycosides alone or in combination had similar effects. Novasoy (up to 200 mug/mL) had no cytotoxic effect. Novasoy (1, 10, and 50 mug/mL) and genistein (1 and 10 muM) markedly increased the protein content of a 40-kDa Tg fragment (P40), a wellknown autoimmunogen, nonglycosylated NIS, and TSHR in the FRTL-5 cells (p < 0.05). The alcohol soluble components other than the major isoflavones in soy remarkably inhibited iodide uptake in the FRTL-5 cells.

Previously, we showed that thyroid-targeted overexpression of the proto-oncogene PTTG-binding factor (PBF) induced striking thyroid gland enlargement in transgenic mice (PBFTg) 1. We have now investigated whether PBF-Tg mice fed on diets with different amounts of phytoestrogens affect goitrogenesis and the development of hyperplastic lesions. PBF-Tg mice fed on a low-phytoestrogen (PE) diet showed an approximate doubling of thyroid weight (mean = 5.9 + 0.9 mg; n = 75) at 6 weeks of age compared to PBF-Tg mice fed a high-PE diet (3.3 + 0.8 mg; n = 98; p < 0.0001). In contrast, the thyroid weight of wildtype (WT) mice increased only marginally when fed the low-PE diet (mean = 2.17 + 0.5 mg; n = 60) compared to the high-PE diet (1.8 + 0.4 mg; n = 68). This increase in thyroid weight was not related to differences in body weight (25.0 + 1.9g v 24.7 + 2.4g; p = 0.3) or thyroid function, as measured by serum analysis of T3 (172.7 + 25.9 versus 154.1 + 46.9 ng/dL, p = 0.5), and T4 levels (2.7 + 0.7 versus 3.2 + 1.2 mug/ dL, p = 0.5), between PBF-Tg mice fed either the low- or high-PE diet, respectively. Analysis of mRNA showed a significant increase in cyclin D1 expression (1.6 + 0.2-fold, p = 0.008), as well as mRNAs encoding for growth factor receptors known to induce thyroid cell proliferation, such as PDGFR (1.6 + 0.3-fold, p = 0.0001), FGFR2 (1.5 + 0.2-fold, p = 0.0001), and KDR (1.4 + 0.2-fold, p = 0.003), in thyroids from PBF-Tg mice fed the low-PE diet compared to those on the high-PE diet. Furthermore, histological examination detected a greater frequency of focal hyperplastic lesions in thyroids from 12-month-old PBF-Tg mice fed the low-PE diet (83% of mice; n = 10/12) versus the high PE diet (8.3% of mice; n = 1/12; p < 0.0001). No hyperplastic lesions were detected in thyroids from age-matched WT mice (n = 0/12). Positive immunostaining with antibodies targeted to Rad6 Ung1 and Trex1 also indicated extensive DNA damage within hyperplastic lesions. These results suggest that phytoestrogens can influence goitrogenesis and hyperplasia in PBF-Tg mice, thus implicating a role for phytoestrogens in modulating thyroid disease.",NA,"*proto oncogene *hyperplasia *thyroid gland mouse diet thyroid weight thyroid disease thyroid cell transgenic mouse serum thyroid function immunohistochemistry body weight examination cell proliferation DNA damage *phytoestrogen cycline messenger RNA growth factor receptor antibody DNA","A78","22","2012",1

Butt","Dietary n-methylserotonin regulates skin temperature in a female rat model of menopause-related hot flash","Background and objectives: Clinical evidence suggests that supplementation with black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) relieves symptoms of menopause, but the data are mixed. N-methylserotonin (NMS) is a minor component of black cohosh and is a selective agonist of a serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtype that is involved in thermoregulation (5-HT7).NMS also has inhibitory activity at the serotonin reuptake transporter [Powell et al. (2008) J Agric Food Chem 56:11718-26]. These findings implicate NMS as an active component of black cohosh that may relieve hot flash and mood-related symptoms of menopause, but the in vivo effects and effective dose(s) of NMS are currently unknown. In this study we sought to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with NMS on induced hot flash and mood in female rats. Methods: Ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were fed diets that contained different levels of NMS (0-18.5 ug/kg/d) or were given estradiol implants. The animals were then tested for locomotor activity in the open field, anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus maze, and depression-like behaviors with the forced swim test. Hot flashes were subsequently induced with intravenous calcitonin gene-related peptide, and skin temperature was monitored with thermocouple probes. Results: Dietary NMS did not affect OVX-induced weight gain, uterine growth, or mood-related behaviors.

Since S-equol has estrogen-like effects, there has been focused on its health benefits for postmenopausal women. In this study, we examined the effects of SE5-OH on bone mineral density (BMD), vascular function, and estradiol (E2) level in breast tissue in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Methods: Eleven-week-old female SD rats underwent either a sham operation (sham group) or OVX. The OVX rats were divided into those groups: OVX+SE5-OH (SE) group), OVX+ S-equol (EQ) group, and OVX groups. The OVX+SE and the OVX+EQ groups were fed a same dose of 0.06% Sequol. Tail blood flow was measured weekly. At 6 week, 24- hour urine was collected for measurement of isoflavone and equol concentration and BMD of the lumbar spine and femur were measured by DXA. The breast fat tissue was collected and E2 level was measured. Results: Tail blood flow was significantly decreased in the OVX group compared with the sham group at weeks 4, 5, and 6Tail blood flows were higher in the OVX+SE and the OVX+EQ groups compared with the OVX group at weeks 5 and 6The BMDs of lumbar spine and femur in the OVX + SE and the OVX + EQ groups were higher than those in the OVX group. Consequently, SE5-OH and S-equol prevented the OVX-induced decline in BMD. The E2 levels in the breast fat tissue in the OVX+SE and the OVX+EQ groups were lower compared with the OVX group.

Among the various dietary components, the role of fat as a risk factor has been extensively studied. High fat diets are known to promote cancer cell proliferation. The aspect of fat quality (saturated/unsaturated/transfat) in cancer causation is complex and not clearly elucidated. Evidence is accumulating that consumption of specific types of fat may be an important determinant of breast cancer risk. The present study looked into the role of saturated vs unsaturated vs PHVO (partially hydrogenated vegetable oil) in experimental DMBA [DiMethylBenzAnthracene]-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female Fisher 344 rats. Methods: Forty weanling female rats were divided into five groups and maintained on synthetic diets with fat content at 10% level comprising saturated fat [palmolein oil], PHVO [vanaspati], n-6 PUFA [sunflower oil], ALA [soybean oil] alone and ALA + long chain (LC) n3 PUFA [soybean+fish oil] respectively for 4 months, after which DMBA was administered orally once a week (for 4 weeks) and continued on same diets for 8 more months, till termination of the experiment. Results:: Tumors (malignant, benign & metastatic) developed least in PHVO group followed by (LC) n3 PUFA and ALAfed animals as compared to other groups and this could be attributed to low level of PUFA in the PHVO group, and ALA in the n3-PUFA containing groups.

Flavonoids, a group of natural compounds, are well known to possess estrogenic effects and used to substitute estrogen, that is, phytoestrogen. Flavonoid serves as one of the potential targets for the development of natural supplements and therapeutic drugs against different diseases. The neuroprotection activity of flavonoids was chosen for a possible development of anti-Alzheimer's drugs or food supplements. The estrogenic activity of two flavonoids, baicalein and daidzein, were demonstrated by their strong abilities in stimulating estrogen receptor phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of estrogen responsive element in MCF-7 breast cells. The neuroprotection effects of flavonoids against beta-amyloid (Abeta) were revealed by their inhibition effects on in vitro Abeta aggregation and Abeta-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 neuronal cells. More importantly, the estrogenic and neuroprotective activities of individual flavonoid could be further enhanced by the cotreatment in the cultures. Taken together, this synergistic effect of baicalein and daidzein might serve as a method to improve the therapeutic efficacy of different flavonoids against Abeta, which might be crucial in developing those flavonoidsin treating Alzheimer's disease in the future. 2013 Roy C.

Freitas Ferreira","Flavonoid Rutin Increases Thyroid Iodide Uptake in Rats","Thyroid iodide uptake through the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) is not only an essential step for thyroid hormones biosynthesis, but also fundamental for the diagnosis and treatment of different thyroid diseases. However, part of patients with thyroid cancer is refractory to radioiodine therapy, due to reduced ability to uptake iodide, which greatly reduces the chances of survival. Therefore, compounds able to increase thyroid iodide uptake are of great interest. It has been shown that some flavonoids are able to increase iodide uptake and NIS expression in vitro, however, data in vivo are lacking. Flavonoids are polyhydroxyphenolic compounds, found in vegetables present in human diet, and have been shown not only to modulate NIS, but also thyroperoxidase (TPO), the key enzyme in thyroid hormones biosynthesis, besides having antiproliferative effect in thyroid cancer cell lines. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of some flavonoids on thyroid iodide uptake in Wistar rats in vivo. Among the flavonoids tested, rutin was the only one able to increase thyroid iodide uptake, so we decided to evaluate the effect of this flavonoid on some aspects of thyroid hormones synthesis and metabolism. Rutin led to a slight reduction of serum T4 and T3 without changes in serum thyrotropin (TSH), and significantly increased hypothalamic, pituitary and brown adipose tissue type 2 deiodinase and decreased liver type 1 deiodinase activities. Moreover, rutin treatment increased thyroid iodide uptake probably due to the increment of NIS expression, which might be secondary to increased response to TSH, since TSH receptor expression was increased. Thus, rutin might be useful as an adjuvant in radioiodine therapy, since this flavonoid increased thyroid iodide uptake without greatly affecting thyroid function. 2013 Goncalves et al.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue antioxidant activity article controlled study drug dose comparison enzyme activity liothyronine blood level male nonhuman *radioiodine test rat *thyroid gland examination thyrotropin blood level thyroxine blood level Wistar rat aurantiin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] biochanin A/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] catechin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] fisetin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] liothyronine/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] morin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] naringenin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] quercetin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] *rutoside/do [Drug Dose] *rutoside/pd [Pharmacology] *rutoside/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] *sodium iodide i 125/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] sodium iodide symporter/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyroid peroxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyrotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyrotropin receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyroxine/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyroxine 5 deiodinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyroxine deiodinase/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"8","2013",1

Wang","Formononetin potentiates epirubicin-induced apoptosis via ROS production in HeLa cells in vitro","The frequent development of multidrug resistance (MDR) hampers the efficacy of available anticancer drugs in treating cervical cancer. In this study, we aimed to use formononetin (7-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone), a potential herbal isoflavone, to intensify the chemosensitivity of human cervical cancer HeLa cells to epirubicin, an anticancer drug. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were correlated with MDR modulation mechanisms, including the transporter inhibition and apoptosis induction. Our results revealed that formononetin significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of epirubicin. Co-incubation of epirubicin with formononetin increased the ROS levels, including hydrogen peroxide and superoxide free radicals. Epirubicin alone markedly increased the mRNA expression of MDR1, MDR-associated protein (MRP) 1, and MRP2. In contrast, formononetin alone or combined treatment decreased the mRNA expression of MRP1 and MRP2. This result indicates that efflux transporter-mediated epirubicin resistance is inhibited at different degrees by the addition of formononetin. This isoflavone significantly intensified epirubicin uptake into HeLa cells. Apoptosis was induced by formononetin and/or epirubicin, as signified by nuclear DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, increased sub-G1 and G2/M phases. The cotreatment triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway indicated by increased Bax-to-Bcl-2 expression ratio, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and significant activation of caspase-9 and -3. In addition, extrinsic/caspases-8 apoptotic pathway was also induced by the cotreatment. N-acetyl cysteine abrogated these events induced by formononetin, supporting the involvement of ROS in the MDR reversal mechanism. This study pioneered in demonstrating that formononetin may potentiate the cytotoxicity of epirubicin in HeLa cells through the ROS-mediated MRP inhibition and concurrent activation of the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways of apoptosis. Hence, the circumvention of pump and non-pump resistance using formononetin and epirubicin may pave the way for a powerful chemotherapeutic regimen for treating human cervical cancer. 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed diets containing either 20 % casein with or without supplemental isoflavones or alcohol-washed SP isolate (SPI) or SP concentrates (SPC) prepared from six different soy bean lines for 8 weeks. Feeding of SPC diets significantly lowered relative liver weights, blood total, free and LDL cholesterol in both genders, and also reduced serum free fatty acid (FFA) and abdominal fat in females compared to the casein or casein + ISF diets. Moreover, dietary SP lowered hepatic total cholesterol, triglycerides and FFA, and prevented the accumulation of hepatic lipid droplet (HLD) compared to a casein diet in the males. Dietary SPC significantly elevated the plasma free thyroxine (T3) in both genders and total T3 in females compared to the casein diet. The SPC with depletion of a0 and A1-3 or a0 and A1-5 subunits increased total T3 in males and reduced plasma enzymatic activities of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase compared to casein or casein + ISF diet. Overall, our results suggest that dietary soy proteins are responsible for the reduction in HLD formation, liver lipids, abdominal fat, liver weight and increased plasma total T3. However, neither the a0 subunit of b-conglycinin nor the A1-5 subunits of glycinin are essential for the hypolipidemic properties of soy proteins.

Abdelnabi","Assessing effects of environmental chemicals on neuroendocrine systems: Potential mechanisms and functional outcomes","Environmental pollutants encompass a vast array of compounds. Most studies in birds have focused on toxicological effects, with little attention to non-lethal effects. Consequently, it has proven difficult to assess potential risk associated with exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Assessing potential adverse effects due to exposure is further complicated by the great variation that occurs across avian species. These include variations in reproductive strategies, life span, sexual differentiation, and migration. Differences in reproductive strategies, particularly in the developmental patterns and mechanisms for precocial and altricial chicks, predispose birds to wide variations in response to steroids and steroid-like EDCs. We have investigated the effects of EDCs in precocial birds including Japanese quail (. Coturnix japonica) and mallard ducks (. Anas platyrhynchos) as well as in wild altricial songbirds. Studies in Japanese quail characterized endogenous steroid hormone changes during development and have demonstrated that the developing embryo uses the yolk as a 'steroid hormone depot'. It appears that actual embryonic exposure is quantitatively lower than indicated by the treatment in egg injections and that the true amount of compound necessary for bioactivity may be quite low relative to the actual dosage delivered. Additionally, embryonic exposure to specific EDCs adversely affected sexual differentiation in quail, especially impacting male sexual behavior as well as neural systems, immune response, and thyroid hormones. Many of these studies considered single compounds; however, wild birds are exposed to complex mixtures and multiple compounds. We tested complex mixtures of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at concentrations that bracketed those found in eggs in contaminated regions. Results indicated that the predictive value of the toxic equivalency (TEQ), based on comparative activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) relative to dioxin was not as accurate as expected. We discuss the potential of developing an endocrine disruption index (EDI) to bridge the inconsistencies observed between responses predicted by the TEQ and those observed in vivo following exposure to EDCs. Further, we will discuss how an EDI would complement the adverse outcome pathways analyses to consider the range of effects of endocrine disruptors in birds. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"article bird chick concentration response Coturnix japonica duck embryo development embryotoxicity environmental exposure immune response lifespan migration *neurotoxicity nonhuman predictive value priority journal quantitative analysis reproduction *reproductive toxicity risk assessment sex differentiation sexual behavior songbird species difference wild species 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene/to [Drug Toxicity] 3,3',4,4',5 pentachlorobiphenyl/to [Drug Toxicity] androgen/ec [Endogenous Compound] aromatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] aromatic hydrocarbon receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] atrazine/to [Drug Toxicity] carbofuran/to [Drug Toxicity] chlorphenotane/to [Drug Toxicity] dimpylate/to [Drug Toxicity] dioxin/to [Drug Toxicity] dopamine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *endocrine disruptor/to [Drug Toxicity] endosulfan/to [Drug Toxicity] environmental chemical/to [Drug Toxicity] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] gonadorelin/ec [Endogenous Compound] luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] methoxychlor/to [Drug Toxicity] noradrenalin/ec [Endogenous Compound] parathion methyl/to [Drug Toxicity] polychlorinated biphenyl/to [Drug Toxicity] serotonin/ec [Endogenous Compound] steroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] trenbolone acetate/to [Drug Toxicity] vinclozolin/to [Drug Toxicity]","194-202","190","2013",-1

Here, we demonstrate that isoliquiritigenin, a flavonoid phytoestrogen from licorice, induces growth inhibition and apoptosis through downregulating multiple key enzymes in AA metabolic network and the deactivation of PI3K/Akt in human breast cancer. Isoliquiritigenin diminished cell viability, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, and clonogenic ability in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells, and induced apoptosis as evidenced by an analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry and hoechst staining. Furthermore, isoliquiritigenin inhibited mRNA expression of multiple forms of AA-metabolizing enzymes, including phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenases (COX)-2 and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4A, and decreased secretion of their products, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), without affecting COX-1, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4). In addition, it downregulated the levels of phospho-PI3K, phospho-PDK (Ser241), phospho-Akt (Thr308), phospho-Bad (Ser136), and Bcl-xL expression, thereby activating caspase cascades and eventually cleaving poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Conversely, the addition of exogenous eicosanoids, including PGE2, LTB4 and a 20-HETE analog (WIT003), and caspase inhibitors, or overexpression of constitutively active Akt reversed isoliquiritigenin-induced apoptosis. Notably, isoliquiritigenin induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice, together with decreased intratumoral levels of eicosanoids and phospho-Akt (Thr308). Collectively, these data suggest that isoliquiritigenin induces growth inhibition and apoptosis through downregulating AA metabolic network and the deactivation of PI3K/Akt in human breast cancer. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"animal experiment animal model antiproliferative activity *apoptosis article *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *cancer inhibition cell proliferation cell survival cell viability clonogenesis controlled study DNA fragmentation *down regulation *enzyme inactivation *fatty acid metabolism flow cytometry gene expression human human cell in vitro study in vivo study mouse nonhuman protein cleavage protein expression protein secretion tumor xenograft 20 hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase activating protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *arachidonic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] broxuridine caspase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclooxygenase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclooxygenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytochrome P450/ec [Endogenous Compound] histone/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoliquiritigenin/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoliquiritigenin/pd [Pharmacology] leukotriene B4/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] phospholipase A2/ec [Endogenous Compound] prostaglandin E2/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein bcl xl/ec [Endogenous Compound] *protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound]","37-48","272","2013",-1

Natural products show anticancer activity and often induce apoptosis or autophagy. The crosstalk between these two types of cell death makes autophagy an interesting target since drugs targeting this process not only can induce cell death by inducing autophagy but can also sensitize cells to apoptosis. Autophagy is also a protective mechanism associated with increased resistance to chemotherapy.

Studies with indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its dimeric product, 3,3'-diindolylmethane (DIM) suggest that these compounds have the ability to deregulate multiple cellular signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. These natural compounds are also effective modulators of downstream transcription factor NF-B signaling which might help explain their ability to inhibit invasion and angiogenesis, and the reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and drug resistance. Signaling through PI3K/Akt/mTOR and NF-B pathway is increasingly being realized to play important role in EMT through the regulation of novel miRNAs which further validates the importance of this signaling network and its regulations by indole compounds. Here we will review the available literature on the modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR/NF-B signaling by both parental I3C and DIM, as well as their analogs/derivatives, in an attempt to catalog their anticancer activity. 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"angiogenesis apoptosis article autophagy breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer therapy cell cycle progression cell growth cell invasion cell metabolism cell survival computer aided design epithelial mesenchymal transition human liver cell carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] lung adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] molecular interaction nonhuman 2,3 diindolyl tetramer 3 chloroacetylindole/po [Oral Drug Administration] 3 indolemethanol/dt [Drug Therapy] 3,3' diindolylmethane 5 methoxyindole 7 nitroindole enzastaurin epidermal growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *indole derivative mammalian target of rapamycin/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA osu a 9/dt [Drug Therapy] osu a 9/po [Oral Drug Administration] phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] silibinin sunitinib unclassified drug vinblastine vincristine","1002-1013","13","2013",-1

Glyceollin may not be a good candidate to preserve bone mass because of its anti-estrogen effect. However, the effect of glyceollin on bone has not been elucidated yet. To explore the effect of glyceollin on bone, we used high-dose vitamin D injection mouse model showing significant bone loss in skeleton. The local calvarial injection or systemic subcutaneous injection of glyceollin (0.5 - 100 mug/kg) once a day for 9 days protected high-dose vitamin D mediated bone loss. Glyceollin treated calvaria or long bone exerted low tartrate resistant acid phosphatase activity compared to control group. To elucidate molecular mechanism of the protective effect of glyceollin on bone, osteoclastogenesis was evaluated using mouse primary cultured bone marrow macrophages (BMM) and osteoblasts. Glyceollin increased BMM proliferation, but it had no effect on osteoblasts proliferation. Glyceollin inhibited the expression of osteoclast markers including OSCAR, NFAT-c1, DC-STAMP, alpha V integrin, and cathepsin K in MCSF/ RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis of BMM. Indeed, glyceollin inhibited osteoclast resorption activity. Besides, glyceollin decreased RANKL expression together with the increase of osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression, which resulted in decrease of RANKL/OPG ratio in primary cultured calvarial osteoblasts. Collectively, these results indicate that glyceollin, a good therapeutic drug candidate as antiestrogen effect on breast and ovarian cancer, preserves bone mass through the inhibition of both osteoclast differentiation and osteoclastogenic function of osteoblasts.",NA,"*bone mass *osteoclastogenesis *society *bone osteoblast ovary cancer osteolysis osteoclast breast drug megadose injection mouse macrophage bone marrow control group long bone calvaria subcutaneous drug administration skeleton animal model *selective estrogen receptor modulator *mineral antiestrogen vitamin D CD51 antigen marker phytoestrogen acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme osteoclast differentiation factor cathepsin K osteoprotegerin",NA,"27","2012",-1

Our aim was to investigate the mechanism(s) involved in the regulation of cardiac growth by E2 testing the hypothesis that estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mediates these E2 effects. Female wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6J and estrogen receptor alpha knockout (ERKO) mice were ovariectomized at two months old and were fed an E2-containing or soy-free (Ctrl) diet for three months (n = 5-6/group). E2 supplementation in OVX mice led to a lower body weight (15% decrease; P < 0.05) and a higher uterus-to-body-weight ratio (5-fold increase; P < 0.001) compared with Ctrl mice, but these E2 effects were abrogated in ERKO mice. E2 led to a higher heart-to-body-weight ratio compared with WT Ctrl mice (20% increase; P < 0.05). Deletion of ERalpha abolished this cardiac effect of E2. The expression of three E2 target genes in the heart was significantly induced by E2 in WT mice compared with Ctrl, whereas in ERKO mice E2 had no effect on Act2, Igf1 and Myocd expression. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that E2 regulates body weight and exerts significant effects on cardiac growth and gene expression via an ERalpha-dependent mechanism.",NA,"mouse heart body weight supplementation diet female gene hypothesis uterus wild type gene expression knockout mouse mouse mutant *estradiol *estrogen receptor",NA,"27","2013",-1

The infection of human papilloma virus (HPV) is the major risk factor for this cancer, although several other factors are also associated. Oxidative stress or antioxidant deficiency has been frequently identified to be associated with cervical cancer. Defects in the antioxidant enzyme systems are reported to play important role behind this antioxidant deficiency, which is responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species and ultimately, DNA damage in cervical cells. In response, cells become more vulnerable to HPV infection for cervical cancer development. Recently, antioxidant therapies or dietary supplementation of antioxidants have gained considerable interests in the cervical cancer treatment.

Sirtinol has been used extensively to identify chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agents that modulate the sirtuins. However, the molecular effect of sirtinol other than serving as sirtuin inhibitor in cells is less clear. The present study addressed this deficiency in the literature. Based on structural similarity with plant-derived cancer preventive/therapeutic compounds such as 3', 3'-diindolylmethane, resveratrol, and genistein, we hypothesized that sirtinol may act on pathways similar to that affected by these compounds in the human prostate cancer cell LNCaP. We found that treatment of LNCaP cells with sirtinol led to concentration-dependent effects on multiple pathways. Sirtinol inhibited LNCaP cell cycle and growth that was correlated with up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A mRNA and protein levels. This effect of sirtinol may due in part to modulation of androgen, estrogen, and insulin-like growth factor-1 mediated pathways as sirtinol treatment led to inhibition of mRNA and protein expression of marker genes involved in these pathways. We also found sirtinol activates aryl hydrocarbon-dependent pathways in LNCaP cells. The effects of sirtinol were observed at 25muM, a concentration lower than Ki (38muM) for sirtuin activity. Based on these results we reasoned that sirtinol exerts pleiotropic effects in cells and that biological effects of sirtinol may not be due solely to inhibition of sirtuin. 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,"article cancer inhibition carcinogenesis cell cycle arrest cell cycle progression cell growth cell strain LNCaP concentration response drug structure human human cell *pleiotropy priority journal *prostate cancer protein expression upregulation 3,3' diindolylmethane/cm [Drug Comparison] 3,3' diindolylmethane/pd [Pharmacology] androgen/ec [Endogenous Compound] cell nucleus receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytochrome P450 1A1/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] resveratrol/cm [Drug Comparison] resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] *sirtinol/cm [Drug Comparison] *sirtinol/pd [Pharmacology] somatomedin C/ec [Endogenous Compound]","676-685","52","2013",-1

Magic","Epigenetics: A new link between nutrition and cancer","Emerging studies suggest that dietary components can affect gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications are heritable and potentially reversible changes in gene expression that do not require changes in the DNA sequence. The main mechanisms of epigenetic control in mammals are DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA silencing. The potential reversibility of epigenetic changes suggests that they could be modulated by nutrition and bioactive food compounds. Thus, epigenetic modifications could mediate environmental signals and provide a link between susceptibility genes and environmental factors in the etiology of cancer. Elucidating the impact of nutrition on epigenetic mechanisms may serve as a tool to predict an individuals susceptibility to cancer, provide dietary recommendations, or provide therapeutic applications of natural compounds against cancer. The optimal duration and the dose necessary for a chemopreventive effect require further studies. There is limited information about tissue specificity and temporal aspects of dietary treatments. Species differences need to be considered when interpreting results from various models. Importantly, molecular mechanisms of bioactive dietary components should be investigated in greater detail in human intervention studies.

Eight hundred twenty-four men, 40+ yr old without prostate cancer, who participated in the 2001-2004 NHANES surveys, were included in the analysis. The association of total PSA, free PSA, and PSA ratio [free PSA/total PSA * 100] with concentrations of isoflavones and lignans (standardized for urinary creatinine concentration) was examined using multivariable-adjusted linear and logistic regression models. The linear regression analyses showed no clear association between creatinine-standardized urinary phytoestrogen concentrations and serum total or free PSA levels or PSA ratio. However, the odds of having a PSA ratio <15% rose from Quartile 1 to Quartile 4 of isoflavone excretion (odds ratio = 2.82, 95% confidence interval 1.28-6.22 for top vs. bottom quartile), but there were no associations with having a PSA ratio <25%.

Our research has focused on the effects dietary genistein on growth of estrogen (E)-dependent mammary tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Genistein enhances the proliferation of E-dependent human breast cancer tumor growth. Genistin, the glycoside form of genistein simulates growth similar to that of genistein and withdrawal of either genistin results in tumor regression. We have also demonstrated that soy protein isolates processed to contain low, medium and high amounts of isoflavones simulate tumor growth in a dose dependent manner. Expression of the estrogen-responsive gene, pS2 was also induced in response to treatment with dietary genistein. We also evaluated the effect of dietary genistein in the chemically-induced (NMU) mammary cancer rodent model and have demonstrated that dietary genistein stimulates growth in this model. To evaluate whether dietary genistein interacts with current anti-estrogen breast cancer therapy such as tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). We implanted E-dependent tumors into ovariectomized athymic mice and administered estradiol, estradiol plus TAM, or estradiol, TAM + dietary genistein. In these studies dietary genistein was able to negate the inhibitory effect of TAM or AIs on E-stimulated tumor growth. It is important to note that genistein has multiple biological activities and at high levels can act to inhibit cell growth. In a recent published study we have shown that the interaction of dietary genistein and TAM depend on the dose of genistein. Genistein is present in soy as part of a complex mixture and the profile of these other bioactive compounds plays an important role; we will present data on how the profile of soy bioactive compounds can modulate genistein stimulated estrogen-dependent tumor growth. In recent years there have been several published reports from human studies that suggest that soy is safe for breast cancer (BC) survivors - these results raise an important issues between the difference in the consumption of soy foods and highly enriched/purified genistein-containing dietary supplements and BC survivors. Much of the confusion between human and pre-clinical studies can be resolved by the timing/duration of administration, the form in which genistein is consumed and the specific subpopulation of BC survivors. In summary, from the pre-clinical studies, genistein can act as an estrogen agonist resulting in proliferation of E-dependent human breast cancer cells in vivo and can negate the inhibitory effects of TAM and AIs on E-stimulated growth of MCF-7 cell tumors (in vivo) implanted into ovariectomized athymic mice. These results suggest that women with estrogen-dependent BC should avoid dietary supplements and soy ingredients high in genistein.",NA,"*breast cancer *target organ *exposure human tumor growth survivor diet supplementation nude mouse neoplasm clinical study breast tumor gene tumor regression soybean cell growth biological activity drug mixture cancer therapy female model cell strain MCF 7 animal model in vitro study agonist cancer cell cancer survivor *phytoestrogen genistein estrogen estradiol genistin isoflavone derivative soybean protein glycoside aromatase inhibitor tamoxifen antiestrogen",NA,"79","2013",-1

Concurrent therapies like SSRIs, Gabapentin or Clonidin have shown their effectiveness in alleviating these complaints in several RCTs, but, nevertheless, the surveys show a suboptimal long time adherence to endocrine therapies in breast cancer patients. Many patients are looking for complementary therapies to improve their quality of life during their treatment with aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen + GnRH-analogue. This review summarizes the current state of clinical research in this field. Several trials with isolated soy isoflavones have shown positive results in treating physiological menopausal symptoms, but three RCTs in breast cancer patients did not show superiority in comparison with placebo. Three of five clinical studies with black cohosh showed a reduction of hot flashes, in a fourth study there was no effect on hot flashes but sweating was reduced in the treatment group, in the fifth study there was no difference between verum and placebo. In a phase-II-study daily intake of 40g bruised flax seed reduced hot flashes by 50%, but in a subsequent phase-III-study flax seed was not superior to placebo. Homeopathic treatment was helpful in an observational study but positive effects were not reproducible in two following RCTs. In a metaanalysis on acupuncture for treating hot flashes in breast cancer patients verum-acupuncture was significantly more effective than sham-acupuncture and a recent RCT showed equivalent effectivity of acupuncture and Venlafaxin. Also a complex 8 week treatment group with yoga, meditation and breathing exercises reduced hot flashes in breast cancer patients. Two small uncontrolled studies suggest positive effects of Yoga on AI associated arthralgias. Two small pilot studies suggest that stellate ganglion block may decrease the number and severity of hot flashes.

However, beside standard treatments many patients use complementary medicine expecting improved treatment results and the reduction of sideeffects. Chinese Medicine is an established treatment in Asia with sound foundations, but the combination of standard treatments with Chinese decoctions is new. Methods: We reviewed the literature for a rational way to use both treatment options without causing unnecessary risks for the patient. Standard treatment for breast cancer follows the S3guideline. We reviewed the literature for the effectiveness of Chinese decoctions for treating breast cancer, coping with side effects and possible interactions with cytotoxic drugs. Results: Single drugs developed from Chinese decoctions have proven efficacy against malignant diseases, but there is no clinical data to quantify the effectiveness of Chinese decoctions for treatment of breast cancer. Also clinical data support the effectiveness of Chinese medicine against treatment related side effects like nausea & vomiting, vasomotor and joint symptoms and bone marrow suppression, but it is not clear, whether this is related to the cytotoxic effect. Very limited data on herb/ decoction - drug interactions is available. Conclusion: Standard treatments according to guidelines have established cure rates above 50%. Chinese decoctions have shown effectiveness in specific situations, but interactions with standard treatment can not be excluded. As evidencebased data on the combination of these treatments is rare, they should be applied in sequence in order to avoid unnecessary risks of compromising cure rates. Simultaneous treatment can be discussed, if standard treatments have failed or side effects compromise an adequate dosing.

In continuation of our research for new phytoestrogens, the aerial parts of Genista halacsyi Heldr., an endemic plant of Greece, was studied. Firstly, by classical separation methods several isoflavones were isolated namely: genistein, daidzein, biochanin, 8Meo-formononetin, isoprunetin, 3'OH-isoprunetin, genistin, 8C-glucopyranosylgenistein, 8C-glucopyranosylorobol and 8C-glucopyranosyl-4'glucopyranosylgenistein. In continuation, high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), a chromatographic technique that eliminates irreversible absorption of the sample onto solid support with an excellent sample recovery was used to isolate larger amounts. The estrogenic activity of all isolated compounds was tested using estrogen receptor-positive MCF7 and estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Their affinity for binding to estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta), was also tested. In addition, we assessed their ability to promote the proliferation of estrogen receptor positive MCF7 breast carcinoma cells and the induction of Alkaline phosphatase activity in Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells, as well as, their ability to regulate the transcription of ERE-dependent reporter genes.

In this study, we evaluated the cell viability effect of BPA on BG-1 human ovarian cancer cells, along with the growth inhibitory effect of resveratrol (trans-3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene; RES), a naturally occurring phytoestrogen. In addition, we investigated the underlying mechanism(s) of BPA and RES in regulating the interaction between estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) signals, a non- genomic pathway induced by 17. beta-estradiol (E2). BPA induced a significant increase in BG-1 cell growth and up-regulated mRNA levels of ERalpha and IGF-1R. In parallel with its mRNA level, the protein expression of ERalpha was induced, and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS-1), phosphorylated Akt1/2/3, and cyclin D1 were increased by BPA or E2. However, RES effectively reversed the BG-1 cell proliferation induced by E2 or BPA by inversely down-regulating the expressions of ERalpha, IGF-1R, p-IRS-1, and p-Akt1/2/3, and cyclin D1 at both transcriptional and translational levels. Taken together, these results suggest that RES is a novel candidate for prevention of tumor progression caused by EDCs, including BPA via effective inhibition of the cross-talk of ERalpha and IGF-1R signaling pathways. 2013 .",NA,"*antineoplastic activity article cancer cell culture cancer growth cancer inhibition cell proliferation *cell viability controlled study ERalpha gene female gene gene expression regulation gene targeting human human cell IGF 1R gene intracellular signaling *ovary adenocarcinoma pharmacological blocking protein expression protein phosphorylation protein protein interaction transcription regulation translation regulation 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol *estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] insulin receptor substrate 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] *resveratrol/an [Drug Analysis] *resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] *somatomedin C receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","373-379","59","2013",-1

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether daily consumption of a soy protein isolate supplement for 2 years reduces the rate of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy or delays such recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, double-blind trial conducted from July 1997 to May 2010 at 7 US centers comparing daily consumption of a soy protein supplement vs placebo in 177 men at high risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Supplement intervention was started within 4 months after surgery and continued for up to 2 years, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements made at 2-month intervals in the first year and every 3 months thereafter. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to receive a daily serving of a beverage powder containing 20 g of protein in the form of either soy protein isolate (n=87) or, as placebo, calcium caseinate (n=90). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biochemical recurrence rate of prostate cancer (defined as development of a PSA level of >0.07 ng/mL) over the first 2 years following randomization and time to recurrence. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early for lack of treatment effects at a planned interim analysis with 81 evaluable participants in the intervention group and 78 in the placebo group. Overall, 28.3%of participants developed biochemical recurrence within 2 years of entering the trial (close to the a priori predicted recurrence rate of 30%). Among these, 22 (27.2%) occurred in the intervention group and 23 (29.5%) in the placebo group. The resulting hazard ratio for active treatment was 0.96 (95%CI, 0.53-1.72; log-rank P = .89). Adherence was greater than 90% and there were no apparent adverse events related to supplementation. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Daily consumption of a beverage powder supplement containing soy protein isolate for 2 years following radical prostatectomy did not reduce biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer in men at high risk of PSA failure.

Ahmad","Resveratrol-based combinatorial strategies for cancer management","In recent years combination chemoprevention has been increasingly appreciated and investigated as a viable and effective strategy for cancer management. A plethora of evidence suggests that a combination of agents may afford synergistic (or additive) advantage for cancer management by multiple means, such as by (1) enhancing the bio-availability of chemopreventive agents, (2) modifying different molecular targets, and (3) lowering the effective dose of agent/drug to be used for cancer management. Resveratrol has been shown to afford chemopreventive and therapeutic effects against certain cancers. Recent studies are suggesting that resveratrol may be very useful when given in combination with other agents. The two major advantages of using resveratrol in combination with other agents are synergistically or additively enhancing the efficacy against cancer and limiting the toxicity and side effects of existing therapies. However, concerted and multidisciplinary efforts are needed to identify the most optimal combinatorial strategies. 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.",NA,"antiproliferative activity article bioavailability breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] *cancer chemotherapy chemoprophylaxis drug efficacy glioma/dt [Drug Therapy] glioma/pc [Prevention] human lung cancer/pc [Prevention] melanoma/dt [Drug Therapy] melanoma/pc [Prevention] nonhuman prostate adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] restenosis/dt [Drug Therapy] skin cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] skin cancer/pc [Prevention] skin carcinogenesis unspecified side effect/si [Side Effect] apigenin/cb [Drug Combination] apigenin/dt [Drug Therapy] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] baicalein/cb [Drug Combination] baicalein/dt [Drug Therapy] baicalein/pd [Pharmacology] catechin/cb [Drug Combination] catechin/dt [Drug Therapy] catechin/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/cb [Drug Combination] curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy] doxorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] gefitinib/cb [Drug Combination] gefitinib/dt [Drug Therapy] gefitinib/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] melatonin/cb [Drug Combination] melatonin/it [Drug Interaction] melatonin/pd [Pharmacology] piperine/cb [Drug Combination] piperine/it [Drug Interaction] piperine/pd [Pharmacology] polyphenol/cb [Drug Combination] polyphenol/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/cb [Drug Combination] quercetin/it [Drug Interaction] quercetin/dt [Drug Therapy] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] *resveratrol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *resveratrol/cb [Drug Combination] *resveratrol/it [Drug Interaction] *resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] *resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] temozolomide/dt [Drug Therapy] temozolomide/pd [Pharmacology]","113-121","1290","2013",-1

Bolton","Evaluation of Estrogenic Activity of Licorice Species in Comparison with Hops Used in Botanicals for Menopausal Symptoms","The increased cancer risk associated with hormone therapies has encouraged many women to seek non-hormonal alternatives including botanical supplements such as hops (Humulus lupulus) and licorice (Glycyrrhiza spec.) to manage menopausal symptoms. Previous studies have shown estrogenic properties for hops, likely due to the presence of 8-prenylnarigenin, and chemopreventive effects mainly attributed to xanthohumol. Similarly, a combination of estrogenic and chemopreventive properties has been reported for various Glycyrrhiza species. The major goal of the current study was to evaluate the potential estrogenic effects of three licorice species (Glycyrrhiza glabra, G. uralensis, and G. inflata) in comparison with hops. Extracts of Glycyrrhiza species and spent hops induced estrogen responsive alkaline phosphatase activity in endometrial cancer cells, estrogen responsive element (ERE)-luciferase in MCF-7 cells, and Tff1 mRNA in T47D cells. The estrogenic activity decreased in the order H. lupulus > G. uralensis > G. inflata > G. glabra. Liquiritigenin was found to be the principle phytoestrogen of the licorice extracts; however, it exhibited lower estrogenic effects compared to 8-prenylnaringenin in functional assays. Isoliquiritigenin, the precursor chalcone of liquiritigenin, demonstrated significant estrogenic activities while xanthohumol, a metabolic precursor of 8-prenylnaringenin, was not estrogenic. Liquiritigenin showed ERbeta selectivity in competitive binding assay and isoliquiritigenin was equipotent for ER subtypes. The estrogenic activity of isoliquiritigenin could be the result of its cyclization to liquiritigenin under physiological conditions. 8-Prenylnaringenin had nanomolar estrogenic potency without ER selectivity while xanthohumol did not bind ERs. These data demonstrated that Glycyrrhiza species with different contents of liquiritigenin have various levels of estrogenic activities, suggesting the importance of precise labeling of botanical supplements. Although hops shows strong estrogenic properties via ERalpha, licorice might have different estrogenic activities due to its ERbeta selectivity, partial estrogen agonist activity, and non-enzymatic conversion of isoliquiritigenin to liquiritigenin. 2013 Hajirahimkhan et al.",NA,"article binding affinity cancer cell cell strain MCF 7 comparative study concentration response controlled study drug mechanism drug receptor binding *drug screening drug selectivity drug structure endometrium cancer enzyme activity enzyme induction *estrogen activity estrogen responsive element gene gene induction Glycyrrhiza Glycyrrhiza glabra glycyrrhiza inflata Glycyrrhiza uralensis Humulus lupulus IC 50 in vitro study isomerization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry *menopausal syndrome nonhuman plant root trefoil factor 1 gene 8 phenylnaringenin/an [Drug Analysis] 8 phenylnaringenin/cm [Drug Comparison] alkaline phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen/an [Drug Analysis] estrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] *Glycyrrhiza glabra extract/an [Drug Analysis] *Glycyrrhiza glabra extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *Glycyrrhiza glabra extract/pd [Pharmacology] *glycyrrhiza inflata extract/an [Drug Analysis] *glycyrrhiza inflata extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *glycyrrhiza inflata extract/pd [Pharmacology] *Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract/an [Drug Analysis] *Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract/pd [Pharmacology] *Humulus lupulus extract/cm [Drug Comparison] isoliquiritigenin/an [Drug Analysis] liquiritigenin/an [Drug Analysis] liquiritigenin/cm [Drug Comparison] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] phytoestrogen *plant extract/an [Drug Analysis] *plant extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *plant extract/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug xanthohumol/an [Drug Analysis]",NA,"8","2013",-1

Four groups of fish raised at two temperatures of 8 C or 12 C and fed two different diets were investigated. The diets included a reference maize gluten and fishmeal-based diet (FM) and an experimental enteropathy-causing diet containing 20% extracted soybean meal (SBM). IEC proliferation and migration were investigated by labelling cells with the in vivo proliferation marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labelling was used as a control for identifying proliferating cells. Samples of the proximal (PI), mid (MI) and distal (DI) intestinal regions were collected at five time points (3 h-28 days) over the experimental period. Histologically, FM-fed fish had normal mucosa, whereas the SBM-fed fish developed DI enteropathy. Major zones of cell proliferation were observed in the mucosal fold bases for all intestinal regions. Over time, BrdU-labelled cells migrated up mucosal folds to the tips before being lost. Migration rates were dependent on intestinal region, temperature and diet. Highest migration rates were observed in the PI followed by the MI and DI for FM-fed fish. Diet and temperature barely affected migration in the PI and MI. Migration in the DI was most sensitive to diet and temperature, with both SBM and the higher water temperature increasing proliferation and migration rates. The slow IEC turnover in the DI might help to explain the sensitivity of this region to dietary SBM-induced enteropathy. 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment animal food animal tissue article *Atlantic salmon *cell migration *cell proliferation controlled study enteropathy *epithelium cell fish histopathology *inflammation *intestine epithelium intestine mucosa maize nonhuman priority journal smolt soybean turnover time *water temperature cycline/ec [Endogenous Compound] gluten sea water","123-137","353","2013",-1

Highest flavonol consumption (>5 mg/d) was associated with later breast development (adjusted hazards ratio [HR]: 0.74, 95% CI: [0.61-0.91]) compared to 2 to 5 mg/d (adjusted HR: 0.84, 95% CI: [0.70-1.0]) and <2 mg/d (referent group; P-trend = .006). Flavonol intake was not associated with pubic hair development. Lignan intake was not associated with either breast or pubic hair development. Dietary intake was only weakly correlated with urinary enterolactone, a biomarker for lignans (RS = 0.13). Consistent with biologic properties of phytoestrogens that indicate hormonal activity, their consumption may be associated with reproductive end points, even in childhood. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"article breast cancer breast development cancer risk child cohort analysis correlation analysis *dietary intake female hormone action human longitudinal study nutrient content nutritional assessment preschool child priority journal *puberty school child vegetable enterolactone *flavonol *lignan","534-542","33","2013",-1

Methods: The animals were divided into 4 groups: 1- sham-operated group (Sham), 2- ovariectomized (OVX) group, 3- OVX treated orally with red clover (750mg/kg/day), 4- OVX treated orally with Royal jelly (750mg/kg/day). Uterine weight, Serum estrogen, follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH)), total cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose were estimated. Neurotransmitters determination for serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were also assayed in hypothalamus. Results: The ovariectomy caused significant reduction in uterine weight (p<0.05), as well as reduction in serum estrogen content and hypothalamic content of 5-HT and DA, whereas, it caused significant elevation in level of LH, FSH, total cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose in serum at p<0.05. The treatment with red clover and Royal jelly stimulated the uterine weight gain as a result of increase in serum estrogen level, they diminished the elevated serum FSH and LH and significantly decreased the triglycerides levels in spite of being caused no significant change in total cholesterol and glucose level. In addition, they regulate the hypothalamic neuronal function by elevation of 5HT and DA secretion as compared to OVX group. Conclusion: The results of the current study revealed that, red clover extract and Royal jelly were capable of acting at multiple targets which probably could improve function of hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in OVX rats mimicking symptoms as observed in postmenopausal females.",NA,"animal model animal tissue article controlled study enzyme linked immunosorbent assay *estrogen activity female hypothalamus nonhuman ovariectomy rat *red clover uterus weight cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] dopamine/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] follitropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] glucose/ec [Endogenous Compound] luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] *red clover extract/po [Oral Drug Administration] *royal jelly/po [Oral Drug Administration] serotonin/ec [Endogenous Compound] triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","593-597","5","2013",-1

They are also implicated in a number of abnormal bioprocesses, such as tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, controlling MMP activities has generated considerable interest as a possible therapeutic target. The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are the major naturally occurring proteins that specifically inhibit MMPs and assist in maintaining the balance between extracellular matrix destruction and formation. However, TIMPs are probably not suitable for pharmacological applications due to their short half-lives in vivo. During the last few decades, synthetic MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) have undergone rapid clinical development in attempts to control MMP enzymatic activities in abnormal bioprocesses. Although studies with these agents have met with limited clinical success, the field of MMPIs is still expanding, and generation of highly effective and selective MMPIs might be a promising direction of this research area. 2013 Wichtig Editore.",NA,"adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] advanced cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] anemia/si [Side Effect] angiogenesis anorexia/si [Side Effect] article bone metastasis breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cell differentiation cell proliferation colorectal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] drug withdrawal enzyme activity esophageal adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] fatigue/si [Side Effect] glioblastoma/dt [Drug Therapy] glioma/dt [Drug Therapy] half life time headache/si [Side Effect] homeostasis human Kaposi sarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy] kidney cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] low drug dose lung non small cell cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] lung small cell cancer malignant ascites/dt [Drug Therapy] melanoma/dt [Drug Therapy] metastasis multiple myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy] musculoskeletal pain/si [Side Effect] nausea/si [Side Effect] nonhuman ovary cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] periodontitis/dt [Drug Therapy] peritonitis/si [Side Effect] phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phase 2 clinical trial (topic) phase 3 clinical trial (topic) phototoxicity plasmacytoma/dt [Drug Therapy] pleura effusion/dt [Drug Therapy] prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] psoriasis vulgaris/dt [Drug Therapy] rash/si [Side Effect] rigidity side effect/si [Side Effect] small intestine obstruction/si [Side Effect] soft tissue sarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy] solid tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] stomach cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] thrombocytopenia/si [Side Effect] tumor growth tumor invasion vomiting/si [Side Effect] 2 [[(4 phenoxyphenyl)sulfonyl]methyl]thiirane 2 [[(4 phenoxyphenyl) sulfonyl] methyl] thiirane 40 2 [n (4 methoxysulfonyl)(3 pyridinylmethyl)amino] 3 methylbutyrohydroxamic acid ae 941/ct [Clinical Trial] ae 941/dt [Drug Therapy] alpha 2 macroglobulin batimastat/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] batimastat/ct [Clinical Trial] batimastat/dt [Drug Therapy] carboplatin/ct [Clinical Trial] carboplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] cisplatin/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] cisplatin/ct [Clinical Trial] cisplatin/cb [Drug Combination] cisplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] collagenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytokine/ec [Endogenous Compound] doxycycline/ct [Clinical Trial] doxycycline/dt [Drug Therapy] gelatinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] gemcitabine/ct [Clinical Trial] gemcitabine/cb [Drug Combination] gemcitabine/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/ec [Endogenous Compound] gi 5712 growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] incyclinide/ct [Clinical Trial] incyclinide/dt [Drug Therapy] kb r 8898 kb r 9896 letrozole/ct [Clinical Trial] letrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] marimastat/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] marimastat/ct [Clinical Trial] marimastat/dt [Drug Therapy] matrilysin/ec [Endogenous Compound] minocycline mitoxantrone/ct [Clinical Trial] mitoxantrone/cb [Drug Combination] mitoxantrone/dt [Drug Therapy] paclitaxel/ct [Clinical Trial] paclitaxel/cb [Drug Combination] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] placenta protein 5 prednisone/ct [Clinical Trial] prednisone/cb [Drug Combination] prednisone/dt [Drug Therapy] prinomastat/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] prinomastat/ct [Clinical Trial] prinomastat/cb [Drug Combination] prinomastat/dt [Drug Therapy] rebimastat/ct [Clinical Trial] rebimastat/cb [Drug Combination] rebimastat/dt [Drug Therapy] small interfering RNA stromelysin/ec [Endogenous Compound] tanomastat/ct [Clinical Trial] tanomastat/dt [Drug Therapy] *tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase/ct [Clinical Trial] *tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase/cb [Drug Combination] *tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase/dt [Drug Therapy] unclassified drug unindexed drug vasculotropin zoledronic acid","117-130","28","2013",-1

Genistein is one of the most active flavonoids in soybeans. Accumulating evidence suggests that genistein alters a variety of biological processes in estrogen-related malignancies, such as breast and prostate cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of genistein in the prevention of human colon cancer remains unclear. Here we attempted to elucidate the anticarcinogenic mechanism of genistein in human colon cancer cells. First we evaluated the growth inhibitory effect of genistein and two other isoflavones, daidzein and biochanin A, on HCT-116 and SW-480 human colon cancer cells. In addition, flow cytometry was performed to observe the morphological changes in HCT-116/SW-480 cells undergoing apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, which had been visualized using Annexin V-FITC and/or propidium iodide staining. Real-time PCR and western blot analyses were also employed to study the changes in expression of several important genes associated with cell cycle regulation. Our data showed that genistein, daidzein and biochanin A exhibited growth inhibitory effects on HCT-116/SW-480 colon cancer cells and promoted apoptosis. Genistein showed a significantly greater effect than the other two compounds, in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, genistein caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, which was accompanied by activation of ATM/p53, p21waf1/cip1 and GADD45alpha as well as downregulation of cdc2 and cdc25A demonstrated by q-PCR and immunoblotting assay. Interestingly, genistein induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner. These findings exemplify that isoflavones, especially genistein, could promote colon cancer cell growth inhibition and facilitate apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. The ATM/p53-p21 cross-regulatory network may play a crucial role in mediating the anticarcinogenic activities of genistein in colon cancer.",NA,"antineoplastic activity apoptosis article cell culture *cell cycle G2 phase *colon cancer controlled study flow cytometry *G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint gene expression human human cell immunoblotting priority journal protein expression real time polymerase chain reaction soybean *ATM protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] protein p21/ec [Endogenous Compound] *protein p53/ec [Endogenous Compound]","289-296","43","2013",-1

Daily growth coefficient (DGC) steadily increased when the supplemental cholesterol was increased by up to 12 %, but declined upon further addition. The total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in plasma generally increased when the supplemental cholesterol was increased by up to 12 %. Thereafter, the TC level reached a plateau, the LDL-C level showed a marked decline, whereas the HDL-C level continued to increase. Dietary cholesterol supplementation generally increased the total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver; the total lipid and TAG levels in muscle; the TC, free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester and total bile acid levels in intestinal contents; and the triiodothyronine and Ca levels in plasma. However, significant differences were mainly observed with high levels of supplemental cholesterol (09-15 %). Low levels of supplemental cholesterol (03-09 %) decreased hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activities, but high levels of supplemental cholesterol (15 %) increased hepatic acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activities. These results suggest that rainbow trout fed SBM-based diets have a certain 'cholesterol-buffering capacity', which in turn suggests the possibility of the inhibition of exogenous cholesterol absorption and/or inadequate endogenous production of cholesterol in trout fed SBM-based diets. DGC increased steadily with increasing supplemental cholesterol level up to 12 %, and the growth-promoting effects might be related to the alleviation of the negative effects caused by a soyabean diet and/or make up for the deficiency of endogenous cholesterol in rainbow trout. 2012 The Authors.",NA,"animal experiment article bile acid blood level biological activity *body growth body weight calcium blood level cholesterol blood level cholesterol diet *cholesterol intake *cholesterol metabolism controlled study *diet supplementation enzyme activity fish hydrocortisone blood level intestine liothyronine blood level lipid absorption liver muscle nonhuman phosphate blood level *rainbow trout *soybean survival rate thyroxine blood level tissue distribution triacylglycerol blood level wheat acyl coenzyme A/ec [Endogenous Compound] alpha tocopherol ascorbate-2-polyphosphate ascorbic acid bile acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] calcium/ec [Endogenous Compound] *cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] cholesterol 7alpha monooxygenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cholesterol acyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cholesterol ester/ec [Endogenous Compound] choline colecalciferol ethoxyquin fish oil high density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] hydrocortisone/ec [Endogenous Compound] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase/ec [Endogenous Compound] liothyronine/ec [Endogenous Compound] low density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] lysine menadione methionine mineral phosphatidylcholine phosphorus/ec [Endogenous Compound] retinol acetate soybean oil thyroxine/ec [Endogenous Compound] triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","29-39","110","2013",-1

Hogervorst","Estrogen and the brain: Does estrogen treatment improve cognitive function?","In this paper we describe potential reasons for the discrepancies between data from basic sciences and observational studies and those of large treatment studies investigating the association between brain function and sex steroids. Observational studies which often showed positive associations between hormone use and cognition can be affected by 'recall bias' and 'healthy user bias', while outcomes of treatment studies were hypothesized to be modified by age at treatment, age at or type of menopause, health status, addition of a progestogen or type of estrogen treatment. However, meta-analyses of data from treatment studies negate many of these hypotheses showing at best mainly short-term (up to 6 months) positive effects of estrogen treatment on cognition regardless of age. This positive effect may reverse, particularly in older women with prolonged hormone treatment, which was predominantly seen after addition of progestogen. Medroxyprogesterone acetate seemed to have worse effects on cognition than other types of progestogen in these long-term studies. Estradiol with or without a progestogen was three times more likely to have positive effects on cognition than conjugated equine estrogens. However, two-thirds of studies showed no associations at all which may be an underestimate given the possibility of publication bias. We briefly review alternative treatments, such as testosterone and soy-derived supplements, but currently insufficient data are available for conclusive comments. Women who have undergone surgical menopause or who undergo natural menopause before age 47 may benefit most from hormone treatment and a special case may need to be made for this group. Long-term safety studies for this group are urgently needed.

Therefore, targeting CSCs will provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment and/or prevention of tumors. However, the regulation of CSCs and its signaling pathways during tumorigenesis are not well understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proved to act as key regulators of the post-transcriptional regulation of genes, which involve in a wide array of biological processes including tumorigenesis. The altered expressions of miRNAs are associated with poor clinical outcome of patients diagnosed with a variety of tumors. Therefore, emerging evidence strongly suggest that miRMAs play critical roles in tumor development and progression. Emerging evidence also suggest that miRNAs participate in the regulation of tumor cell growth, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, drug resistance, and metastasis. Moreover, miRNAs such as let-7, miR-21, miR-22, miR-34, miR-101, miR-146a, and miR-200 have been found to be associated with CSC phenotype and function mediated through targeting oncogenic signaling pathways. In this article, we will discuss the role of miRNAs in the regulation of CSC phenotype and function during tumor development and progression. We will also discuss the potential role of naturally occurring agents (nutraceuticals) as potent anti-tumor agents that are believed to function by targeting CSC-related miRNAs. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"3' untranslated region article cancer incidence *cancer stem cell *cancer therapy cell differentiation cell invasion cell migration cell proliferation DNA binding drug bioavailability glioma cell human microarray analysis nonhuman phenotype prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] real time polymerase chain reaction transcription regulation tumor growth Wnt signaling pathway 3 indolemethanol/dt [Drug Therapy] 3,3' diindolylmethane/dt [Drug Therapy] CD133 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] curcumin Hermes antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 1beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *microRNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 101/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 146a/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 200/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 21/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 22/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 34a/ec [Endogenous Compound] polyphenol/dt [Drug Therapy] resveratrol transcription factor ZEB1/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor necrosis factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug vasculotropin vitamin D","1858-1868","13","2012",-1

A comprehensive search of the literature show that such an interest in natural product pharmacology has surged in the last 25 years and particularly risen at exponential rates since the last one decade. Phytochemicals such as curcumin (from spice turmeric), resveratrol (from red wine) and genistein (from soy) share the major efforts as indicated by overwhelming publications, despite skepticism concerning their bioavailability. Ascorbic acid (AA), the popular anti-oxidant in fruits and vegetables, has even a longer historical perspective than these dietary agents as for more than 35 years; there had been lingering questions about the efficacy of AA in cancer therapy. The footprints of AA from ""scurvy"" to ""cancer"" though complex seems to carry potential provided the puzzle could be set right. The use of AA in cancer treatment has been debated extensively as evident from the literature but surprisingly the complementing early phase bench work on the mechanistic studies for anticancer action was rather retarded. Proposed mechanisms of action for AA in the prevention and treatment of cancer includes antioxidant as well as pro-oxidant properties, stimulation of the immune system, altering carcinogen metabolism, enhancement of collagen synthesis necessary for tumor encapsulation and interference with cancer cell signaling. The observation that the intravenous administration of AA enhances its bioavailability to the extent of deriving pharmacological benefits against cancer has in recent years partially supported the clinical plausibility (efficacy) of AA towards realizing its translational advantage. Here, we provide an overview of AA with regard to its potential in the management of cancer disease. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"adjuvant therapy angiogenesis antineoplastic activity apoptosis article ascorbic acid deficiency ascorbic acid metabolism bioavailability biosynthesis breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer cell cell communication cell survival *chemoprophylaxis colorectal cancer cytotoxicity DNA cleavage DNA damage DNA repair drug competition drug efficacy drug megadose gene expression human immune response inflammation kidney cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] liver cell carcinoma lung cancer multicenter study (topic) multiple myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy] *neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phase 2 clinical trial (topic) randomized controlled trial (topic) scurvy/dt [Drug Therapy] single drug dose steady state target cell translational research tumor microenvironment alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial] arsenic trioxide/dt [Drug Therapy] *ascorbic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] *ascorbic acid/cb [Drug Combination] *ascorbic acid/dv [Drug Development] *ascorbic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] *ascorbic acid/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *ascorbic acid/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] *ascorbic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration] *ascorbic acid/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *ascorbic acid/pd [Pharmacology] asparaginase/dt [Drug Therapy] bleomycin/dt [Drug Therapy] bortezomib/cb [Drug Combination] bortezomib/dt [Drug Therapy] cisplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] creatine/cb [Drug Combination] creatine/dt [Drug Therapy] cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination] cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy] doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy] erlotinib/ct [Clinical Trial] erlotinib/cb [Drug Combination] erlotinib/dt [Drug Therapy] ethylnitrosourea/dt [Drug Therapy] fluorouracil/cb [Drug Combination] fluorouracil/dt [Drug Therapy] gemcitabine/ct [Clinical Trial] gemcitabine/cb [Drug Combination] gemcitabine/dt [Drug Therapy] melphalan/cb [Drug Combination] melphalan/dt [Drug Therapy] melphalan/po [Oral Drug Administration] methotrexate/dt [Drug Therapy] methylglyoxal/cb [Drug Combination] methylglyoxal/dt [Drug Therapy] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo procarbazine/dt [Drug Therapy] tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand/dt [Drug Therapy] vinblastine/dt [Drug Therapy] vincristine/dt [Drug Therapy]","1757-1771","13","2012",-1

Subsequent literature is replete with reports of studies of diet and nutrition often containing widely varying advice for women regarding reducing their breast cancer risk. Methods: A systematic search in PubMed of the published literature was conducted to identify meta-analyses and pooled analyses relating breast cancer risk to a wide variety of nutritional components including intake of coffee, dairy, dietary fibre, eggs, fat components, fruits and vegetables, glycaemic index and load, meat components, minerals, seafood, soy, tea, and a variety of vitamins. Inclusion criteria were: published in English, time period 2000-2011, and restricted to studies with a prospective design. All published relative risks and confidence intervals were abstracted. Results: The search retrieved 2 pooled analyses and22 meta-analyses concerning alcohol (1), coffee (2), dairy (3), dietary fibre (2), eggs (1), fat components (3), fruits and vegetables (2), glycaemic index and load (3), meat (3), minerals (1), seafood (1), soyfood (1), tea (3), and vitamins (5). In total 256 relative risks were computed by meta- and pooled analyses, with 195 (76%) statistically not significant, 16 (6%) showing an increased risk and 45 (18%) showing a decreased risk of breast cancer. 18 relative risks were less than 0.90 and 5 were greater than 1.25.

Boles","Production of recombinant lunasin peptides with enhanced anticancer activity using transient expression in tobacco","Epidemiological observations suggest a correlation between high levels of soybean product consumption and lowered incidence and mortality due to prostate, breast and colon cancer. Lunasin, a 43-44 amino acid peptide derived from soybean, has been implicated as a significant source of this anticancer activity. Lunasin contains nine consecutive aspartic acid residues at the C-terminus that bind to hypoacetlyated core histones, a minimal internal RGD cell adhesion motif and a helical region exhibiting structural homology to conserved sequences of chromatin binding proteins. Initial studies demonstrated that lunasin can prevent the transformation of mammalian cells by chemical carcinogens or viral oncogenes, and inhibits chemically-induced tumors in a mouse skin cancer model. These results suggest that lunasin may be useful as a cancer chemoprevention agent. More recent studies have demonstrated that lunasin can inhibit the proliferation of several established human cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that lunasin may also be useful as a cancer therapeutic. Lunasin's anticancer effects are currently limited to specific cancer cell types and require 10-100 muM concentrations of peptide. We have now established a transient expression system based on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus vector, Geneware, for large-scale production of modified forms of recombinant lunasin in tobacco. Our initial studies revealed that we could not detect any significant protein accumulation using constructs expressing lunasin peptides alone. We modified our strategy by expressing lunasin peptides as C-terminal fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) that includes a linker sequence containing a thrombin cleavage site. We have demonstrated that this system can produce GFP-lunasin at levels >100 mg/kg fresh weight tissue and demonstrated that the lunasin peptide can be recovered by proteolytic cleavage with thrombin. We have used this system to produce a modified form of lunasin that contains an N-terminal RGD domain sequence that preferentially binds to the alphavbeta6 integrin that is highly expressed in a number of epithelial-derived carcinomas. In vitro studies using cancer cell lines expressing the alphavbeta6 integrin demonstrate that the RGD-lunasin peptide is >10-fold more active in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation than the natural form of lunasin. Moreover, RGD-lunasin inhibits the proliferation of some cancer cell lines that are insensitive to 100 muM lunasin.

Sarkar","Improved therapeutic activity of Isoflavone-G2535 and Docetaxel combination in hormone refractory prostate cancer","The emergence of Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) and its subsequent metastasis to the bone is in part driven by Androgen Receptor (AR) signaling, and contributes to overall poor survival of prostate cancer patients. Here, we present in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence of chemo-sensitization of CRPC cells to the most clinically useful therapeutic agent, Docetaxel (Taxotere) by G2535, an isoflavone that attenuates AR signaling. In vitro studies were done using AR+ prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines (LNCaP and C4-2B) to understand the molecular basis of combination therapy. We found that the combination was significantly more effective in inhibiting cell growth and induction of apoptosis (p<0.01), down-regulation of AR and its target, prostate specific antigen (PSA) (p<0.01) with suboptimal concentrations of Docetaxel (1nmole/L) compared to monotherapy. It is known that resistance to chemotherapy in CRPC is partly associated with constitutively activated NF-B/Akt signaling pathways, which becomes further activated by chemotherapeutic drugs, and these molecular targets were found to be down-regulated by G2535 treatment. Of greater significance were the results from in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies conducted in a SCID-hu model of experimental bone metastasis induced by C4-2B cells. Tumor volume, AR and serum PSA was used as response markers to evaluate therapeutic activity of the combination therapy relative to a single regimen and untreated control. At termination, we found 75% reduction in tumor volume elicited by the combination treatment relative to the untreated control group. Most importantly, the anti-tumor activity was associated with the down-regulation of molecular markers in tumor tissue remnants that were similar to those observed in vitro (down regulation of NF-B, Bcl-2 and survivin) accompanied by a significant reduction in serum PSA. Using qPCR, we found that the level of miR-34a, which target AR, was increased by 1.5 fold after G2535 treatment alone whereas this increase was found to be 3-fold in the combination group. Increased expression of miR-34a resulted in the down regulation of AR and PSA in this in vivo model. Based on our findings, we conclude that the combination of G2535 and Taxotere could be an alternative promising regimen for the treatment of CRPC and its metastases for which curative treatment is urgently needed.",NA,"*castration resistant prostate cancer *cancer research down regulation prostate cancer in vitro study tumor volume model serum metastasis therapy chemotherapy apoptosis cell growth cell strain LNCaP tissues sensitization antineoplastic activity control group human monotherapy B lymphocyte cancer patient survival bone metastasis cancer inhibition bone neoplasm cancer cell culture *docetaxel *isoflavone microRNA 34a prostate specific antigen survivin marker antiinfective agent androgen receptor molecular marker",NA,"72","2012",-1

Dharmawardhane","Increased expression of eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor eIF4G by the daidzein metabolite equol may contribute to breast cancer malignancy","The role of dietary soy in cancer has been the subject of intense investigation and is thought to be cancer preventive. However, the beneficial effects of soy on established breast cancer is controversial. We recently demonstrated that dietary daidzein and combined soy isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein) promoted breast cancer progression in a nude mouse model by increasing both primary mammary tumor growth and metastasis. Dietary daidzein significantly upregulated cancer promoting molecules including eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factors (eIF) eIF4G and eIF4E. Herein, using tumors from mice treated orally with daidzein, we show that increased eIF expression is associated with expression of mRNAs with long structured 5' untranslated regions and internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) that are sensitive to eIF4E and eIF4G levels. We then tested the hypothesis that daidzein upregulates protein synthesis initiation in breast cancer, but found that daidzein treatment did not affect the levels of eIFs in the same MDA-MB-435 cell line in vitro. Therefore, we tested the effect of equol that is metabolized from daidzein by the gut bacteria in mice and humans. Results show that equol specifically upregulated eIF4G, but not eIF4E, in MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Equol treatment also increased gene and protein expression of c-MYC and protein expression of other cell survival and proliferation promoting molecules with IRES sites. The elevated eIF4G in response to equol was not associated with eIF4E in a cap binding co-capture assay. Therefore, upregulation of eIF4G by equol may regulate cap-independent protein synthesis initiation resulting in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and thus, tumor progression.",NA,"*metabolite *breast cancer *cancer research human neoplasm mouse tumor growth protein expression cancer cell cell survival RNA translation 5' untranslated region metastasis breast tumor internal ribosome entry site hypothesis animal model upregulation nude mouse assay gene intestine flora cancer growth in vitro study cell line oncogene c myc *daidzein *equol *initiation factor genistein isoflavone derivative glycitein",NA,"72","2012",-1

These compounds are similar in structure to estrogen and bind to the estrogen receptors (ER). Estrogen receptors are involved in the regulation of cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis. It is likely that these compounds could affect the same biological processes or have their own subsets of target pathways. Here, we extensively identify target genes and signaling pathways for selected xeno- and phytoestrogens. Dose response curves for these compounds were measured using real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and transactivation assays of known estrogen target genes. Gene expression profilings for each EDC were performed on MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines using dual-color comparative array. Validations of array results were carried out using RT-PCR. Gene ontology and gene network mapping studies were done to identify the mechanism of action of these compounds. Non-ER mediated targets and the kinetics of each EDC were investigated in detail. Results show that many target genes regulated by bisphenol A and Genistein were involved in biological processes including cell cycle and proliferation, similar to that of estrogen. This contributes to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of EDC action, which may be implicated in development of diseases such as breast cancer and reproductive disorders, and would contribute to a more reliable risk assessment of different EDC compounds.",NA,"*cancer research gene breast cancer diseases cell cycle kinetics cancer cell culture dose response apoptosis gene expression assay transactivation real time polymerase chain reaction color risk assessment genital system *phytoestrogen *estrogen receptor estrogen 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol genistein endocrine disruptor isoflavone derivative",NA,"72","2012",-1

There is a growing public awareness toward prevention and detection of breast cancer in Japan. We have previously shown in a case-control study that consumption of either soy isoflavone or fermented milk drink containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) decreases the risk of developing breast cancer. To investigate the preventive effects of LcS and soy isoflavone against breast cancer, we next conducted an animal study. Female SD rats were treated with the heterocyclic amine PhIP (2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine) under a diet containing LcS, soymilk, both LcS and soymilk or LcS-fermented soymilk (L-FSM), and changes were observed for 17 weeks. As a result, decrease in adenocarcinoma and tumor multiplicity was observed in the soymilk, LcS + soymilk and L-FSM groups. Suppression of tumor volume was observed in the LcS, LcS + soymilk and L-FSM groups. Results indicate the possibility that soymilk prevents adenocarcinoma formation, while LcS suppresses tumor growth.

More importantly, they undergo a similar mammary gland development process and develop spontaneous breast cancers. Epidemiological studies of humans show that high soy intake is associated with lower breast cancer risk. Since nutrition and/or environmental exposure during youth are critical factors to disease risk in adulthood, timing of intervention may determine soy protective effect to breast cancer. Studies in NHP allow interrogation of developmental effects on the primate breast to a degree not possible in human subjects. We report here novel in-utero developmental effects of soy isoflavones (IF) on the NHP breast. Method: Soy IF were detected in amniotic fluid (255.5 + 93.3 nM) and milk (266.3 nM), which confirmed that soy exposure occurred in-utero and via nursing. We assessed the effects of in-utero and pre-pubertal soy exposure on the breast of NHP during puberty with a focus on changes related to estrogen exposure. We utilized mammary tissues from animals that were exposed to soy beginning in-utero (n=5 for soy and casein/control groups) or before puberty (n=12-17 for soy and casein groups). Animals were fed a diet modeled on a typical North American diet (35% calories from fat) with soy dose approximated at 120-180 mg IF/person/day. We assessed nipple length, mammary gland morphology, markers of mammary gland differentiation, proliferation, and estrogen receptor activity, and concentrations of serum estradiol and progesterone. Results: Regardless of dietary treatment, gene expression of estrogen-responsive markers in the breast was highest during pre-puberty and decreased across the pubertal transition (P<0.0001 for time effect on ESR1, PGR, GREB1, and TFF1). This pattern coincided with a decrease of terminal end bud structures and an increase of lobular differentiation and glandular area. Although an effect of dietary soy was not observed in pre-pubertally exposed animals, in-utero exposed animals showed lower expression of TFF1 (0.03-fold; P<0.05), a classic marker of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) activity. Serum estradiol level was not different with dietary treatment, nor did IF alter mRNA expression of estrogen-metabolizing enzymes in the breast. Conclusions and Future Directions: Our data suggest that timing of exposure may influence the effects of dietary soy on the breast; in-utero soy exposure resulted in modestly lower expression of a gene marker of ER activity, while pre-pubertal exposure had negligible effects on mammary gland outcomes. A follow-up study is currently underway to further examine potential effects of in-utero soy exposure on estrogen responsiveness and pubertal development, and whether epigenetic modulation is the underlying mechanism behind the differential expression of estrogen-related genes.",NA,"*gene expression *nonhuman *primate *breast *cancer research *exposure mammary gland human breast cancer puberty diet therapy estradiol blood level diet calorie milk amnion fluid physiology Macaca marker gene prepuberty adulthood risk juvenile morphology nipple environmental exposure nutrition cancer risk gene nursing follow up modulation genetics alpha rhythm *estrogen marker messenger RNA isoflavone derivative estrogen receptor casein progesterone estrogen receptor alpha enzyme",NA,"72","2012",-1

Tollefsbol","Enhanced chemosensitivity of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-negative breast cancer through soybean genistein-induced epigenetic reactivation of ERalpha","Estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-negative breast cancer is clinically aggressive and has a poor prognosis due to the lack of estrogen target-directed therapies. The soybean isoflavone, genistein (GE), has been shown to prevent and inhibit breast cancer and recent studies have suggested that GE can enhance the anticancer capacity of an estrogen antagonist, tamoxifen (TAM), especially in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells. However, the role of GE in ERalpha-negative breast cancer remains unknown. In our current studies, we found that GE can reactivate ERalpha expression and this effect was synergistically enhanced when combined with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. GE treatment also re-sensitized ERalpha-dependent cellular responses to activator 17beta-estradiol (E2) and antagonist TAM. Further studies revealed that GE can lead to remodeling of the chromatin structure in the ERalpha promoter thereby contributing to ERalpha reactivation. The global enzymatic activities for HDACs and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) mediated by GE were altered to favor ERalpha up-regulation. Consistently, dietary GE significantly reduced the growth of ERalpha-negative mouse xenograft tumors due at least in part to ERalpha reactivation. The combination of GE with TAM had more prominent effects on delaying tumor growth than either treatment alone. Collectively, our studies suggest that soybean genistein can epigenetically restore ERalpha expression, which in turn increases TAM-dependent anti-estrogen chemosensitivity. The results from our studies revealed a novel chemotherapeutic combination approach using bioactive soybean product and anti-hormone therapy in refractory ERalpha-negative breast cancer which will provide more effective options in breast cancer therapy.",NA,"*chemosensitivity *breast cancer *soybean *cancer research cancer cell prognosis hormonal therapy tumor growth neoplasm xenograft enzyme activity therapy promoter region upregulation mouse chromatin structure cancer therapy *estrogen receptor *genistein antiestrogen estradiol trichostatin A tamoxifen isoflavone methyltransferase estrogen DNA histone deacetylase inhibitor",NA,"72","2012",-1

Soy intake and risk of prostate cancer are inversely correlated; soy isoflavones inhibit growth of prostate cancer cells and reduce prostate carcinogenesis in animal models. We tested the hypothesis that soy consumption reduces biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy in a randomized controlled clinical trial with a soy protein supplement versus a casein-based placebo in men at increased risk for PSA failure in the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy. PSA was tested at 2-month intervals in year 1 and every 3 months in year 2. Eligibility criteria were: Gleason sum of >8, extra-capsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, positive lymph nodes, and/or a preoperative PSA of >20 ng/ml. Biochemical recurrence was defined a priori as reaching a PSA value of alpha0.07 ng/ml, confirmed twice. A two-year PSA failure rate in eligible subjects of approximately 30% was expected, based on data from NYU and previous literature. With a planned sample size of 128 evaluable subjects per arm, the study had 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in PSA failure rate at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. The soy protein isolate and placebo (generously provided by Solae LCC, St Louis, MO) were identical in composition, except for the protein source (19.2-19.8 g protein/day); the soy product provided daily 23.5 mg genistein and 40.9 mg total isoflavones (aglycone equivalents); the placebo was devoid of any soy-specific constituents. Accrual did not reach the intended level and 172 subjects were randomized and enrolled, of whom 142 were evaluable (completed two years on study or developed confirmed recurrence within two years). Soy protein consumption did not alter recurrence rate or time-to-recurrence (TTR). Of the 74 evaluable subjects in the soy arm 22 (30%) recurred as did 22 (32%) of the 68 subjects in the placebo arm recurred. The mean TTR was 40.7 + 29.3 (SD) weeks in the soy group and 44.5 + 28.0 weeks in men on placebo. Statistical analysis on intention-to-treat basis confirmed the absence of an effect on these primary endpoints. The drop-out rate was 17% and there were <5% missing values, none of which impacted the primary endpoints. Compliance by self-report was excellent and is being confirmed by serum isoflavone levels. There were no treatment-related adverse events, except a few cases of constipation.

Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms were also examined. Methods:120 MMTV-erbB-2 transgenic female mice were randomly divided into four groups:control group, early exposure group, late exposure group and lifelong exposure group. The control group mice were treated with soy free diet from week 3 to week 60, the experiment groups mice were treated with soy diet between week 3 to week 12, week 20 to week 60, week 3 to week 60, respectively. Then, the body weight change of each mice, the latency period, and the growth speed of mammary tumor were recorded. Furthermore, the mammary gland morphology was examined by whole mount at 5 weeks. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of the mammary tumor development, the signal pathways of c-Fos, erbB2 and p-ERK were also examined in breast cancer tissue using immunohistochemistry. Results:We found that the weight in the four groups had no significant difference. Compared with the control group, the TEB numbers and the growth speed of tumors in the early exposure group and the lifelong exposure group were significantly decreased and the tumor latency periods were significantly prolonged (P<0.05). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that the mice in the early exposure group and the lifelong exposure group displayed decreased expression of c-Fos and p-ERK (P<0.05). The expression of erbB-2 protein among the different groups was not statistically significant (P>0.05).

We demonstrated that this approach can be used to elucidate novel molecular mechanisms for the Chinese medicinal formula Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) which is widely used for women's health in Asian countries. The human breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with beta-estradiol (E2, 0.1 muM) or SWT extract (0.0256, 0.256, and 2.56 mg/ml) for six hours showed significant gene expression changes. The differentially expressed genes related to SWT treatment were used to compare with the gene expression profiles of 1,309 compounds in the CMAP database. Such comparison revealed that the CMAP profile of E2-treated MCF-7 cells showed an excellent match with SWT treatment (permutation p<0.00001), consistent with SWT's widely claimed use for women's diseases and suggesting a phytoestrogen effect. Many genes strongly up-regulated by E2 were similarly upregulated by SWT, e.g., GREB1, a well-known estrogen regulated gene. Of interest with regard to the potential cancer preventive activity of SWT, the oncogenes MYBL1 and cyclin D1 were found to be strongly induced by E2 but not by SWT. In addition, SWT inhibited expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, but not ER-beta. Consistently, at low concentration (1.5 and 3.0 mg/ml), SWT stimulated MCF-7 (ER-positive) cell growth, while at high concentration (> 6.0 mg/ml), it inhibited the growth of MCF-7. The combination of SWT with tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, demonstrated enhanced growth inhibitory effects on MCF-7 cells.

Group I- Control, Group II- Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) alone treated, Group III- Soy protein treated, Group IV- Garlic protein treated, Group V- Coconut protein treated, Group VI- Whey protein treated, Group VII- Casein treated. The animals were acclimatized in their respective diets for 60 days. On the 60th day, DEN was given intraperitoneally as a single dose (120 mg/kg body weight) in saline, to each animal in groups from II to VII, and was followed by weekly subcutaneous injections of carbon tetrachloride for four weeks at individual doses of 3 mL/kg body weight to induce hepatocellular carcinoma. Group I and II, were continued on the normal diet and the groups III to VII were fed their respective diets for 120 days. Thus Group II consisted of animals that were HCC-induced with DEN. Animals belonging to groups III-VII were pre and post treated with different protein isolates from specific sources. At the end of the experimental period, ie. on day 120, the mice were sacrificed and blood for serum separation and liver sample for biochemical analysis were collected. Alpha-fetoprotein, ornithine decarboxylase, tumor necrosis factor-beta, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were assayed both in serum and in liver homogenate. Summary of data: The levels of alpha-fetoprotein, ornithine decarboxylase, tumor necrosis factor-beta, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were elevated and the antioxidant enzymes were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in diethylnitrosamine alone treated mice.

Therefore, we combined two different interventions which had each been shown alone to inhibit mammary tumorigenesis but had not been tested in combination. The first intervention was consumption of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which is found in fish oil and the second intervention was calorie restriction. We utilized six groups of MMTV-Her2/neu mice as a model for human breast cancers which over express Her2/neu. Starting at 10 weeks of age half of the mice were fed a control diet composed of a modified AIN-93M formula with fat derived from soy oil. The other half consumed a diet with 71.75% of fat calories from EPA. Mice were further divided into ad libitum (AL), chronic calorie restricted (CCR) or intermittent caloric restricted (ICR) groups. AL groups (Control and EPA) received unrestricted access to their diets. CCR groups were given 75% of the total calories that the AL age-matched groups consumed. ICR groups were fed calories equal to 100% of the AL age-matched groups for three weeks followed by three weeks of calories equal to 50% of the AL age-matched groups. The 6 week cycles of restriction and refeeding were maintained until the mice were 60 weeks of age or were euthanized due to mammary tumors (MTs). MT incidence was lowest in the ICR-EPA group (15%) and highest in the AL-Con group (87%) while the AL-EPA, CCR-Con, CCR-EPA and ICR-Con had MT incidence rates of 63%, 47%, 40% and 59%, respectively The average survival until terminal end point was also longest in the ICR-EPA group at 59.2 weeks and shortest in the AL-Con group at 52.6 (P<0.0002). The average tumor burden was 0.98 grams for ICR-EPA mice and 1.78 grams for AL-Con mice but due to the very small number of MTs in the ICR-EPA group this was not a significant difference. Histopathology showed no significant difference in tumor grades between the groups. To better understand the effects of the interventions we examined serum for alterations in adipokines and growth factors. We found that EPA consumption dramatically reduced the levels of leptin (P<0.02) and increased the levels of adiponectin in the AL mice (P<0.001) but did not significantly alter animal weights at 25 weeks of age. Calorie restriction was also able to significantly decrease serum leptin levels and increase serum adiponectin levels. Serum IGF-I was significantly reduced by calorie restriction with the ICR-Con having the lowest level. The presence of EPA in the diet did not significantly change the levels of IGF-I. These results illustrate that MT inhibition is significantly increased when ICR and EPA are combined as compared to either intervention alone or no intervention. This effect may be related to alterations in serum growth factors and adipokines.",NA,"*breast tumor *cancer inhibition *caloric restriction *cancer research calorie mouse serum diet breast cancer human therapy weight model carcinogenesis neoplasm histopathology tumor volume survival incidence refeeding prevention *icosapentaenoic acid *adipocytokine leptin growth factor adiponectin soybean oil fish oil omega 3 fatty acid",NA,"72","2012",-1

Constantinou","Equol enhances tamoxifen's antitumor effect by induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells","Soy phytoestrogens, such as daidzein and its metabolite equol, have been proposed to be responsible for the low breast cancer rate in Asian women. However, since these compounds possess both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic properties, it remains unknown whether they provide protection against tumor development and progression. Since the majority of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are treated with the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, the basic objective of this project is to determine whether equol enhances or inhibits tamoxifen's anti-tumor effect and to identify the molecular mechanisms involved. For this purpose, we examined the individual and combined effects of equol and tamoxifen on the ER+ breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (ERalpha+/ERbeta+). We found that equol at concentrations higher than 10 muM significantly reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the combination of equol (100 muM) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; 10 muM) reduced MCF-7 cell viability and induced apoptosis more effectively than each compound alone. Subsequent treatment of MCF-7 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and the calpain/cathepsin inhibitor ALLN demonstrated that equol and 4-OHT induce apoptosis via both caspase-depended and -independed mechanisms. In order to further investigate the apoptotic pathways employed by equol, 4-OHT and their combination, we evaluated the expression of key proteins involved in apoptosis such as PARP, alpha-fodrin, AIF, bcl-2, bax, p21 and p53 using Western blot analysis. The combination of 4-OHT and equol induced PARP and alpha-fodrin cleavage which was inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK indicating that their combination induces caspase-depended apoptosis. This was accompanied by reduced bcl-2:bax ratio confirming a pro-apoptotic effect. The combination of equol and 4-OHT induced caspase-7 cleavage indicating a significant role for caspase-7 in equol- and tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Finally, upon determination of the effect of equol and tamoxifen on estrogen receptor expression in MCF-7 cells, it was found that equol reduces the ERalpha:ERbeta ratio, while 4-OHT increases it. When cells were treated with both compounds we observed that the effect of equol prevailed, providing an additional explanation for the beneficial combined effects of equol and tamoxifen. In conclusion, the effects of equol in potentiating tamoxifen's anti-tumor effect may be explained by the induction of the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway and the reduction of the ERalpha:ERbeta ratio.

Aydiner","Complementary and alternative therapies used by Turkish breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy","Background: Most breast cancer patients use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), usually in parallel with their conventional treatments. This study was planned to determine the prevalence and determining factors for use of CAM by breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: This descriptive study was carried out between October 2010 and May 2011, and included 96 patients at the Istanbul University Institute of Oncology. The Patient Characteristics form and Complementary and Alternative Medicine Scale were used for data collection. Descriptive and nonparametric tests were performed, and logistic regression analysis was used to predict factors affecting CAM use. Results: Praying was the most frequently used form of CAM, and most of the herbal supplements used by patients were harmless. Herbal use was higher among patients who had local disease (relative risk (RR) 4.48%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-17.95), and worship was more common among those who had not undergone surgery (RR 4.66%, 95% CI 1.64-13.20). Conclusion: The CAM approaches used by patients were found to be safe. However, sage and flax seed usage for estrogenand progesterone-positive patients and exercise for patients with spinal metastasis can be inappropriate approaches. It is important to question and inform patients about CAM use during treatment. 2012 S.

We examined the protective effect of genistein in tumor-bearing mice after abdominal irradiation by evaluation of apoptosis and intestinal morphological changes.Methods: Mouse colon cancer CT26 cells were subcutaneously injected at the flank of BALB/c mice to generate tumors. The tumor-bearing mice were treated with abdominal radiation at 5 and 10 Gy, and with genistein at 200 mg/kg body weight per day for 1 d before radiation. The changes in intestinal histology were evaluated 12 h and 3.5 d after irradiation. To assess the effect of the combination treatment on the cancer growth, the tumor volume was determined at sacrifice before tumor overgrowth occurred.Results: Genistein significantly decreased the number of apoptotic nuclei compared with that in the irradiation group 12 h after 5 Gy irradiation. Evaluation of histological changes showed that genistein ameliorated intestinal morphological changes such as decreased crypt survival, villus shortening, and increased length of the basal lamina 3.5 d after 10 Gy irradiation. Moreover, the genistein-treated group exhibited more Ki-67-positive proliferating cells in the jejunum than the irradiated control group, and crypt depths were greater in the genistein-treated group than in the irradiated control group. The mean weight of the CT26 tumors was reduced in the group treated with genistein and radiation compared with the control group.Conclusion: Genistein had a protective effect on intestinal damage induced by irradiation and delayed tumor growth. These results suggest that genistein is a useful candidate for preventing radiotherapy-induced intestinal damage in cancer patients. 2013 Son et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment animal model animal tissue apoptosis article basement membrane cancer growth cell nucleus cell proliferation cell survival colon cancer/rt [Radiotherapy] controlled study female histopathology intestine crypt *intestine injury/dt [Drug Therapy] *intestine injury/pc [Prevention] intestine villus irradiation jejunum mouse nonhuman radiation dose *radiation injury/dt [Drug Therapy] *radiation injury/pc [Prevention] *radiation protection radiosensitivity tumor volume *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] Ki 67 antigen",NA,"13","2013",-1

The fruits and vegetables contain fibers, vitamins, phytosterols, sulfur compounds, carotenoids, and organic acids, which all provide beneficial effects on health, but they also contain a variety of polyphenols. Recently, polyphenols have received considerable attention because of their various physiological effects, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects. In addition, experimental evidence demonstrates that some polyphenols participate in regulation of intestinal tight junction (TJ) barrier. The TJ, a multiple-protein complex, regulates the paracellular permeability between the epithelial cells and the dysfunction is implicated with the pathogenesis of intestinal and systemic diseases. Among polyphenols investigated, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, morin, hesperetin, naringenin and daidzein have been reported to enhance the basal TJ integrity in intestinal cells. In most cases, the enhancements are accompanied by increases in the expression and/or cytoskeletal association of TJ proteins, such as occludin, claudins and zonula occludens. Genistein, epigallocatechin-3-gallate and curcumin present protective effects on the TJ integrity against harmful substances, such as oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chrysin increases the intestinal permeability through decreased expression and cytoskeletal association of TJ proteins. Based on these evidences, the regulation of intestinal TJ barrier by polyphenols could be therapeutic and preventive approaches for intestinal barrier defect-associated diseases. 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"alcohol liver disease/et [Etiology] antiinflammatory activity article breast cancer cell junction cell membrane cell strain CACO 2 chemical structure colon cancer confocal microscopy Curcuma dietary intake endotoxemia Escherichia coli in vitro study intestine epithelium cell *intestine function large intestine nonhuman obesity oxidative stress permeability priority journal prostate cancer Salmonella typhimurium Southeast Asia sucrose density gradient centrifugation chrysin claudin 1 claudin 4 curcumin daidzein fluorescein sodium genistein heme oxygenase 1 hesperetin hydrogen peroxide kaempferol lucifer yellow morin myricetin naringenin occludin *polyphenol derivative quercetin","85-92","9","2013",-1

Recent studies suggested that 7,3',4'-THIF exerts a hypopigmentary effect in B16F10 cells, however, its underlying molecular mechanisms and specific target remain unknown. Here, we found that 7,3',4'-THIF, but not daidzein, inhibited alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)-induced intracellular and extracellular melanin production in B16F10 cells. The expression of tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) was also suppressed by 7,3',4'- THIF treatment at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and cAMP response element-binding (CREB), crucial transcription factors involved in tyrosinase expression, were activated by alpha-MSH and 7,3',4'-THIF abolished this activation. 7,3',4'-THIF the inhibited alpha-MSH-induced dephosphorylation of AKT and phosphorylation of p38 kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). cAMP and pull-down assay revealed that 7,3',4'-THIF strongly inhibited forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP production and bound directly with melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). Moreover, 7,3',4'-THIF inhibited alpha-MSH-induced intracellular melanin production in human epidermal melanocytes (HEMs). Collectively, these results demonstrate that 7,3',4'- THIF targets MC1R directly, resulting in the suppression of melanin production, suggesting a protective role for 7,3',4'-THIF against melanogenesis.",NA,"*melanogenesis *dermatology *metabolite human phosphorylation dephosphorylation DNA responsive element melanocyte soybean assay *isoflavone *daidzein *melanocortin 1 receptor intermedin monophenol monooxygenase phosphotransferase tyrosinase related protein 1 transcription factor microphthalmia associated transcription factor forskolin cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase","S234","133","2013",-1

Soy food is a rich source of phytoestrogens known to have both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects. No study has been conducted to evaluate the association between soy food intake and BMD in breast cancer survivors. Forearm BMD was measured for 1699 participants of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study at 60 months post breast cancer diagnosis using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Soy food intakes collected at 6-, 18-, and 36-months post-diagnosis were averaged. Linear and logistic regressions were used to evaluate the associations of soy protein and isoflavones with BMD and osteoporosis. Confounding and effect modification by hormonal related factors such as menopausal age, years since menopause, body mass index (BMI), and tamoxifen use, were evaluated. The averaged mean (+SD) intakes of soy protein and isoflavones were 12.1 + 6.5 grams/day and 48.2 + 28.0 milligrams/day. Soy protein and isoflavone intakes were inversely associated with BMD and positively associated with osteoporosis at the proximal forearm; compared to the lowest quartile, the highest quartile of soy isoflavone intake was associated with a reduction of BMD by 0.0140 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.0258, -0.0022) and an increased odds ratio of 1.65 for osteoporosis (95% CI: 1.06, 2.55). No effect modification by tamoxifen use or BMI was observed. Overall, our study suggests that soy isoflavone intakes at a median level of 79.5 milligrams/day (range: minimum - 99% = 62.6 - 174.3) may unfavorably affect BMD among breast cancer survivors.",NA,"*bone density *breast cancer *cancer survivor *human *society *epidemiology soybean osteoporosis female risk food intake menopause forearm cancer diagnosis osteolysis cancer survival fracture confidence interval body mass logistic regression analysis diagnosis dual energy X ray absorptiometry *isoflavone soybean protein isoflavone derivative tamoxifen estrogen phytoestrogen","S60","177","2013",-1

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of replacing commonly used rendered animal fat as a dietary source of saturated fatty acids and soybean oil as a source of unsaturated fatty acids, with palm oil and red palm oil in combinations with rapeseed oil, linseed oil and two levels of selenium enriched yeast on chicken breast meat nutritional value. The study also wished to see whether red palm oil had a cholesterol lowering effect on chicken plasma.204 male, newly hatched broiler chickens were randomly divided into twelve dietary treatment groups, and individually fed one out of six dietary fat combinations combined with either low (0.1 mg Se /kg feed) or high (1 mg Se/kg feed) dietary selenium levels. Linseed oil, independent of accompanying dietary fat source, lead to increased levels of the n-3 EPA, DPA and DHA and reduced levels of the n-6 arachidonic acid (AA). The ratio between AA/EPA was reduced from 19/1 in the soybean oil dietary groups to 1.7/1 in the linseed oil dietary groups. Dietary red palm oil reduced total chicken plasma cholesterol levels. There were no differences between the dietary groups with regard to measured meat antioxidant capacity or sensory evaluation. Chicken meat selenium levels were clearly influenced by dietary selenium levels, but were not influenced by feed fatty acid composition. High dietary selenium level lead to marginally increased n-3 EPA and higher meat fat % in breast muscle but did not influence the other LC PUFA levels. Chicken breast meat nutritional value from the soybean oil and low selenium dietary groups may be regarded as less beneficial compared to the breast meat from the linseed oil and high selenium dietary groups. Replacing rendered animal fat with palm oil and red palm oil had no negative effects on chicken muscle nutritional value with regard to fatty acid composition. Red palm oil decreased total chicken plasma cholesterol, confirming the cholesterol reducing effect of this dietary oil. 2013 Nyquist et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"article *chicken meat cholesterol blood level diet therapy fat intake lipid composition male nonhuman *nutritional value sensory evaluation arachidonic acid cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *linseed oil *palm oil *rapeseed oil *red palm oil saturated fatty acid *selenium unclassified drug unsaturated fatty acid",NA,"12","2013",-1

The phytoSERM combination was found neuroprotective and non-feminizing both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it prevented or alleviated physical and neurological changes associated with human menopause and Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, we conducted translational analyses to compare the effects of racemic R/S-equol-containing with S-equol-containing phytoSERM therapeutic combinations on mitochondrial markers in rat hippocampal neuronal cultures and in a female mouse ovariectomy (OVX) model. Data revealed that both the S-equol and R/S-equol phytoSERM treatments regulated mitochondrial function, with S-equol phytoSERM combination eliciting greater response in mitochondrial potentiation. Both phytoSERM combination treatments increased expression of key proteins and enzymes involved in energy production, restored the OVX-induced decrease in activity of key bioenergetic enzymes, and reduced OVX-induced increase in lipid peroxidation. Comparative analyses on gene expression profile revealed similar regulation between S-equol phytoSERM and R/S-equol phytoSERM treatments with minimal differences. Both combinations regulated genes involved in essential bioenergetic pathways, including glucose metabolism and energy sensing, lipid metabolism, cholesterol trafficking, redox homeostasis and beta-amyloid production and clearance. Further, no uterotrophic response was induced by either of the phytoSERM combinations. These findings indicate translational validity for development of an ER beta selective S-equol phytoSERM combination as a nutraceutical to prevent menopause-associated symptoms and to promote brain metabolic activity.

When developing zebrafish embryos were treated with glyceollins, pigmentation of the embryos, melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity were all decreased compared with control zebrafish embryos. In situ expression of a pigment cell-specific gene, Sox10, was dramatically decreased by glyceollin treatment in the neural tubes of the trunk region of the embryos. Stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit signaling pathways as well as expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were determined by western blot analysis. Glyceollins inhibited melanin synthesis, as well as the expression and activity of tyrosinase induced by SCF, in a dose-dependent manner in B16F10 melanoma cells. Pretreatment of B16F10 cells with glyceollins dose-dependently inhibited SCF-induced c-kit and Akt phosphorylation. Glyceollins significantly impaired the expression and activity of MITF. An additional inhibitory function of glyceollins was to effectively downregulate intracellular cyclic AMP levels stimulated by SCF in B16F10 cells. Glyceollins have a depigmentation/whitening activity in vitro and in vivo, and that this effect may be due to the inhibition of SCF-induced c-kit and tyrosinase activity through the blockade of downstream signaling pathway. 2013 KSBMB.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment *anti melanogenesis activity article concentration response controlled study down regulation *drug activity drug effect drug mechanism drug structure embryo enzyme inhibition enzyme phosphorylation gene expression in vitro study in vivo study intracellular signaling mouse nonhuman pigmentation protein expression protein phosphorylation sox10 gene soybean Western blotting zebra fish adenylate cyclase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclic AMP/ec [Endogenous Compound] *depigmenting agent/an [Drug Analysis] *depigmenting agent/cm [Drug Comparison] *depigmenting agent/pd [Pharmacology] *glyceollin derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *glyceollin derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] *glyceollin derivative/pd [Pharmacology] glyceollin i/an [Drug Analysis] glyceollin i/cm [Drug Comparison] glyceollin i/pd [Pharmacology] glyceollin ii/an [Drug Analysis] glyceollin ii/cm [Drug Comparison] glyceollin ii/pd [Pharmacology] glyceollin iii/an [Drug Analysis] glyceollin iii/cm [Drug Comparison] glyceollin iii/pd [Pharmacology] melanin/ec [Endogenous Compound] microphthalmia associated transcription factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] monophenol monooxygenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] phenylthiourea/cm [Drug Comparison] *phytoalexin/an [Drug Analysis] *phytoalexin/cm [Drug Comparison] *phytoalexin/pd [Pharmacology] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] *stem cell factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] stem cell factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Sox10/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug",NA,"45","2013",-1

These results are relevant in premenopausal women with breast cancer of the ERalpha-negative and ERbeta-positive type, especially given the increasing trends of soy intake among the US population in the past decade. The aim of the present study was to identify the mechanism by which genistein plus 17beta-estradiol inhibits the cell proliferation of ERalpha-negative and ERb-positive breast cancer cells. Our hypothesis is that the balance of signaling actions by genistein plus 17beta-estradiol from different signaling pathways is likely to lead to the cell's choice to either proliferate or enter the apoptotic pathway. For this purpose, the effect of low and high concentrations of genistein (1 muM and 100 muM) in the presence or absence of 17beta-estradiol (1 nM) was studied on the expression of cell signaling proteins involved in cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis (pERK1/2, pAkt, Bax and Bcl2) and correlated to cell proliferation and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 (ERbeta positive and ERalpha negative) breast cancer cells. Methods: Cell proliferation was determined by the MTT assay, apoptosis determined microscopically by the use of acridine orange and ethidium bromide dyes and the expression of cell signaling proteins by western blotting. Results: Our results show that 1muM genistein plus 17beta-estradiol significantly increased apoptosis (p<0.05) as compared to the control (12.47% vs 5.87% respectively). Increased expression of Bax/Bcl2 (2.5 fold) along with a decreased expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (2 fold) was observed in cells treated with 1muM genistein plus 17beta-estradiol as compared to the control cells. Phosphorylated Akt did not show any differences in the treatment condition as compared to the control. High concentrations of genistein (100 muM) in the presence or absence of 17beta-estradiol also increased apoptosis; however these changes could not be correlated to the expression of Bax/Bcl2, or pERK1/2. Conclusion: In conclusion, our results show that physiological concentrations of genistein in the presence of17beta-estradiol inhibit cell growth through apoptosis via increased Bax/Bcl2 and a concomitant decrease in pERK1/2 expression. Our results also suggest that different concentrations of genistein elicit cell responses through different signaling mechanisms.

Prospective epidemiologic studies supporting a protective effect of calcium on breast cancer risk have mainly been limited to Western populations. We examined the association between calcium intake and breast cancer risk in the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a large population-based prospective cohort. Calcium intake and supplement use was assessed by in-person interviewer using a validated food frequency questionnaire. After a mean follow-up of 14.2+3.5 years, 823 cohort participants developed invasive breast cancer. Multivariate proportional hazards regression models were fitted to examine the associations between calcium intake and breast cancer risk. Vegetables were the primary food source of calcium in this study population, followed by dairy products, grains and soy foods. Calcium intake was not associated with breast cancer risk, comparing highest quartile (>345.6 mg/1,000 kcal/day) to lowest quartile (<204.5 mg/1,000 kcal/day) of intake. There was no evidence of effect modification by menopausal status, body mass index, dietary vitamin D or stage of disease at diagnosis. Our findings do not support a hypothesis for calcium in breast cancer chemoprevention, contrary to findings from previous studies among Western populations with higher calcium intake primarily from dairy products and supplements. What's new? Studies on Western populations have reported that increased calcium intake can help prevent breast cancer. Asian populations, however, have low incidence of breast cancer, yet consume little calcium. This study investigated whether any link can be observed between calcium intake and breast cancer in Asian populations. The authors found no association between breast cancer risk and calcium, consumed either from food or supplements, in a Singaporean Chinese population. This is in contrast to three previous studies on Asian populations in Japan and China, but this could be attributed to differences in study design; while the others were retrospective studies, the current paper reports the first prospective study to investigate this question.

Twenty eight (28) male albino wistar rats weighing between 100-150g were used for the experiment. The rats were randomly divided into 4 groups of 7 rats each. Group 1 served as the control and were given distilled water while groups 2-4 were oral gavaged once daily for 28 days with the following; carbimazole 0.01mg/kg, fresh soybean 207.84mg/kg and fresh orange juice 1500mg/kg respectively. The LD50 of fresh orange juice and fresh soybean were determined by the method of Lorke's. Blood sample was collected by cardiac puncture and processed to obtain serum for electrolyte and urea analysis. The results showed that Na+ was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in the carbimazole treated group when compared to the control, fresh orange juice and fresh soybean groups. The serum K+ levels was significantly (p<0.05) reduced by carbimazole when compared to the control and fresh orange juice groups.

The objective of this systematic review was to critically examine double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of non-herbal dietary supplements and vitamins (NHDS) for evidence that prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were reduced in PC patients. Five databases were searched from their inception through December 2012 to identify studies that met our inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane tool. Eight RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were of high methodological quality. The following supplements were tested: isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein), minerals (Se) or vitamins (vitamin D) or a combination of antioxidants, bioflavonoids, carotenoids, lycopenes, minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg), phytoestrogens, phytosterols, vitamins (B2, B6, B9, B12, C, and E), and other substances (CoQ10 and n-acetyl-l cysteine). Five RCTs reported no significant effects compared with placebo. Two RCTs reported that a combination of antioxidants, isoflavones, lycopenes, minerals, plant oestrogens and vitamins significantly decreased PSA levels compared with placebo. One RCT did not report differences in PSA levels between the groups. In conclusion, the hypothesis that dietary supplements are effective treatments for PC patients is not supported by sound clinical evidence. There are promising data for only two specific remedies, which contained a mixture of ingredients, but even for these supplements, additional high quality evidence is necessary before firm recommendations would be justified. 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,"cancer patient *cancer therapy data base *diet supplementation human *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] protein blood level randomized controlled trial (topic) review systematic review acetylcysteine/ct [Clinical Trial] acetylcysteine/dt [Drug Therapy] alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial] alpha tocopherol/cb [Drug Combination] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] antioxidant/ct [Clinical Trial] antioxidant/cb [Drug Combination] antioxidant/dt [Drug Therapy] ascorbic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] ascorbic acid/cb [Drug Combination] ascorbic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] bioflavonoid/ct [Clinical Trial] bioflavonoid/dt [Drug Therapy] carotenoid/ct [Clinical Trial] carotenoid/dt [Drug Therapy] copper/ct [Clinical Trial] copper/cb [Drug Combination] copper/dt [Drug Therapy] cyanocobalamin/ct [Clinical Trial] cyanocobalamin/cb [Drug Combination] cyanocobalamin/dt [Drug Therapy] daidzein/ct [Clinical Trial] daidzein/cb [Drug Combination] daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] genistein/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] glycitein/ct [Clinical Trial] glycitein/cb [Drug Combination] glycitein/dt [Drug Therapy] lycopene/ct [Clinical Trial] lycopene/cb [Drug Combination] lycopene/dt [Drug Therapy] magnesium/ct [Clinical Trial] magnesium/cb [Drug Combination] magnesium/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] phytoestrogen/cb [Drug Combination] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] phytosterol/ct [Clinical Trial] phytosterol/cb [Drug Combination] phytosterol/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] pyridoxine/ct [Clinical Trial] pyridoxine/cb [Drug Combination] pyridoxine/dt [Drug Therapy] riboflavin/ct [Clinical Trial] riboflavin/cb [Drug Combination] riboflavin/dt [Drug Therapy] selenium/ct [Clinical Trial] selenium/cb [Drug Combination] selenium/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/ct [Clinical Trial] vitamin D/cb [Drug Combination] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] zinc/ct [Clinical Trial] zinc/cb [Drug Combination] zinc/dt [Drug Therapy]","125-130","75","2013",-1

However, many herbal drugs and herbal extracts despite of their impressive in-vitro findings demonstrates less or negligible in-vivo activity due to their poor lipid solubility or improper molecular size, resulting in poor absorption and hence poor bioavailability. Nowadays with the advancement in the technology, novel drug delivery systems open the door towards the development of enhancing bioavailability of herbal drug delivery systems. For last one decade many novel carriers such as liposomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, transferosomes, ethosomes, lipid based systems etc. have been reported for successful modified delivery of various herbal drugs. Many herbal compounds including quercetin, genistein, naringin, sinomenine, piperine, glycyrrhizin and nitrile glycoside have demonstrated capability to enhance the bioavailability. The objective of this review is to summarize various available novel drug delivery technologies which have been developed for delivery of drugs (herbal), and to achieve better therapeutic response.

Its activity is due to phytoestrogens which could act like estrogen to bring about an estrogenic effect. This study aims to investigate the estrogenic activity of various LP extracts using an in-vitro model. Methods: Various extracts and fractions was obtained from LP and tested for estrogenic activity using an in-vitro alkaline phosphatase assay using Ishikawa cells. Highly estrogenic water extract was fractionated using preparative high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The extracts and fractions were also tested for their effect on cell proliferation. Results: Standardized water extract of LP at 100mug/ml was highly estrogenic (2.56 fold of the control) thus was further fractionated. The last fraction eluted from HPLC presented the highest estrogenic activity (2.84 fold of the control), even higher than that of the water extract. Meanwhile, butanol, hexane and dichloromethane solvents did not significantly induce estrogenic activity. All the extracts showed minimal induction of cell proliferation (<20.00%) in comparison to estradiol (a positive control). Conclusion: The high estrogenic activity and lower cell proliferation induction of the water extract provides a good insight for its use as an estrogen replacement agent. Consequently, this provides a respectable outcome towards the commercial products which contains LP extracts.",NA,"article cell proliferation controlled study *drug activity endometrium *estrogenic activity human human cell reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography alkaline phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *Labisia pumila extract/dv [Drug Development] *plant extract/dv [Drug Development] unclassified drug","448-452","5","2013",-1

Sardao","Phytoestrogens as potential alternative for hormone replacement therapy","Background: Phytoestrogens (PE) are plant-derived compounds with similar structure to 17-beta-Estradiol (E2), and able to display estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic activity. Despite several studies performed with PE, the risk and benefits of those compounds in female health are not yet well established. Thus, the main purpose of this project was to identify PE able to attenuate the symptoms associated with menopause, with special focus on hot flushes. Materials and methods: BBB capillaries and breast-derived cell lines were used as models in our ex-vivo/in vitro studies. Capillaries were incubated with the E2 and PE for 6 h. Breast-derived cell lines were incubated for 24 h with the same compounds. Ovariectomized Wistar rats were treated with Coumestrol or E2 for 24 h. Rats Temperatures were evaluated with Temperature Transponder, IPTT-200, BMD system and mitochondrial function was evaluated through Clark-type Oxygen and TPP+ electrode. Results: From an initial screening, coumestrol appeared to have the most promising characteristics. Coumestrol increased GLUT1 expression in isolated brain capillaries, which may facilitate the delivery of glucose to the brain and thus attenuate the hot flushes symptoms. Experiments with breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that 24 h after treatment, the proliferation of breast cancer cells was lower in the presence of coumestrol than with E2. Coumestrol was thus selected for further in vivo studies, performed with ovariectomized Wistar rats. Obtained results from this study demonstrated that coumestrol improved mitochondrial function in ovariectomized rats and promoted a decrease in temperature variation six hours after the treatment, as E2. Conclusions: Together, our results suggest that coumestrol may help to suppress hot flashes in menopausal women, appearing to be a safe and valid alternative to the HRT.",NA,"*hormone substitution *society temperature hot flush menopause rat breast cancer cell line Wistar rat female breast capillary human plant in vivo study cancer cell cancer cell culture health brain capillary encephale isole model risk brain screening electrode blood brain barrier *phytoestrogen coumestrol estradiol glucose oxygen","74","43","2013",-1
"493","407"," Z. Suba","Circulatory estrogen level protects against breast cancer in obese women","Literary data suggest apparently ambiguous interaction between menopausal status and obesity-associated breast cancer risk based on the principle of the carcinogenic capacity of estrogen. Before menopause, breast cancer incidence is relatively low and adiposity is erroneously regarded as a protective factor against this tumor conferred by the obesity associated defective estrogen-synthesis. By contrast, in postmenopausal cases, obesity presents a strong risk factor for breast cancer being mistakenly attributed to the presumed excessive estrogen-production of their adipose-tissue mass. Obesity is associated with dysmetabolism and endangers the healthy equilibrium of sexual hormone-production and regular menstrual cycles in women, which are the prerequisites not only for reproductive capacity but also for somatic health. At the same time, literary data support that anovulatory infertility is a very strong risk for breast cancer in young women either with or without obesity. In the majority of premenopausal women, obesity associated insulin resistance is moderate and may be counteracted by their preserved circulatory estrogen level. Consequently, it is not obesity but rather the still sufficient estrogen-level, which may be protective against breast cancer in young adult females. In obese older women, never using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) the breast cancer risk is high, which is associated with their continuous estrogen loss and increasing insulin-resistance. By contrast, obese postmenopausal women using HRT, have a decreased risk for breast cancer as the protective effect of estrogen-substitution may counteract to their obesity associated systemic alterations. The revealed inverse correlation between circulatory estrogen-level and breast cancer risk in obese women should advance our understanding of breast cancer etiology and promotes primary prevention measures. New patents recommend various methods for the prevention and treatment of obesity-related systemic disorders and the associated breast cancer. 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"anovulation antidiabetic activity antihypertensive activity antineoplastic activity article *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/et [Etiology] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer incidence cancer risk carcinogenesis disease association *estrogen blood level estrogen synthesis estrogen therapy female infertility hormone action hormone substitution human insulin resistance/et [Etiology] menopause menstrual cycle metabolic disorder/et [Etiology] metabolic syndrome X/et [Etiology] obesity ovary polycystic disease/dt [Drug Therapy] patent postmenopause premenopause priority journal risk factor *estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *estrogen/to [Drug Toxicity] *estrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] oral contraceptive agent/dt [Drug Therapy] oral contraceptive agent/po [Oral Drug Administration] oral contraceptive agent/pd [Pharmacology] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology]","154-167","8","2013",-1

Shoshan","Potentiation of anti-cancer treatment by modulators of energy metabolism","Oncogene-driven proliferative signaling in tumor cells requires comprehensive upregulation of cellular energy metabolism and macromolecule syntheses. These alterations are now known to include not only upregulated glycolysis, but also increased fatty acid metabolism, glutaminolysis, deregulated mitochondrial function and more. Many prospective targets for tumor-specific pharmacological modulation of metabolism have therefore been identified. While the prospectivedrugs do not necessarily show very high antitumor activity by themselves, they may by depriving tumor cells of energy and building blocks for repair and proliferation come to be of major clinical use as potentiators of standard chemotherapeutic drugs and/or radiation. To this end, not only inhibitors of specific enzyme functions are being investigated, but also drugs affecting the complex signaling networks that regulate organismal and cellular energy status. This review provides examples of how modulators of energy metabolism (MEMs) targetting different aspects of tumor cell metabolism have been found to potentiate cancer treatment in vitro and in vivo. 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"acute lymphoblastic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy] article autophagy breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer chemotherapy cell metabolism chemoprophylaxis colon cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cytotoxicity *drug potentiation *energy metabolism glycolysis human low drug dose lymphatic leukemia mesothelioma/dt [Drug Therapy] myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy] myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy] *neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman ovary cancer oxidative stress pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phase 2 clinical trial (topic) prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] respiratory chain *antineoplastic agent/ct [Clinical Trial] *antineoplastic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] camptothecin carboplatin/cb [Drug Combination] carboplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] carmustine/dt [Drug Therapy] cisplatin/cb [Drug Combination] cisplatin/cm [Drug Comparison] cisplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] coumestrol/dt [Drug Therapy] curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] deoxyglucose/ct [Clinical Trial] deoxyglucose/cb [Drug Combination] deoxyglucose/dt [Drug Therapy] deoxyglucose/po [Oral Drug Administration] deoxyglucose/pd [Pharmacology] dichloroacetic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] docetaxel/cb [Drug Combination] docetaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol 3 methyl ether/dt [Drug Therapy] etomoxir/cb [Drug Combination] etomoxir/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] glucocorticoid/dt [Drug Therapy] imatinib/cb [Drug Combination] imatinib/dt [Drug Therapy] lactate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] melphalan/dt [Drug Therapy] oxaliplatin/cb [Drug Combination] oxaliplatin/cm [Drug Comparison] oxaliplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP)/ec [Endogenous Compound] piceatannol/dt [Drug Therapy] polyphenol/dt [Drug Therapy] prednisolone/cb [Drug Combination] prednisolone/dt [Drug Therapy] pyruvic acid derivative/cb [Drug Combination] pyruvic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] pyruvic acid derivative/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] reactive oxygen metabolite/dt [Drug Therapy] resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] rotenone/dt [Drug Therapy] unindexed drug","313-330","14","2013",-1

Apigenin is known to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitelomerase, antidepressant, and antispasmodic activities. In particular, apigenin has been shown to possess antitumour properties and therefore poses special interest for the development of a novel chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent for cancer. In this study, we investigated whether apigenin suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells. Methods. We performed proliferation and MTT assays to measure growth rate of SKBR3 cells treated with apigenin. We also performed FACS analysis and western blot to confirm apoptosis induced by apigenin in SKBR3 cells. Results. We found that apigenin, genistein, and quercetin significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (0-100 mM) in SKBR3 cells after 72 h of treatment. Apigenin also induced growth inhibition in a time-dependent manner. FACS analysis demonstrated that apigenin induced an increase in the sub G0/G1 apoptotic fractions (apoptosis) in SKBR3 cells. We investigated whether apigenin activated caspase-dependent apoptosis by measuring the expression of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP. We observed that apigenin upregulated the levels of cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3, and induced the cleavage of PARP in SKBR3 cells. We also found that cleavages of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP were inhibited by caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-fmk) and caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-fmk). However, apigenin overcame such inhibitions, inducing cleaved caspases and PARP. Moreover, caspase-8 inhibitor and caspase-9 inhibitor did not suppress cell growth while apigenin caused apoptosis even in their presence. These results confirm that apigenin strongly produces apoptosis via a caspasedependent mechanism. Discussion. Apigenin induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in SKBR3 cells. Thus, apigenin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. .",NA,"*oncology *cancer cell *apoptosis *breast cancer *Asian *translational research herb fluorescence activated cell sorting growth inhibition parsley Achillea lemon cell proliferation cell growth thyme Equisetum Western blotting growth rate assay neoplasm *caspase *apigenin caspase 8 caspase 3 caspase 9 inhibitor caspase 8 inhibitor antioxidant spasmolytic agent quercetin genistein chamomile peppermint antiinfective agent flavonoid antidepressant agent benzyloxycarbonylleucylglutamylhistidylaspartyl fluoromethyl ketone benzyloxycarbonylisoleucylglutamylthreonylaspartyl fluoromethyl ketone","S18","49","2013",-1

Hu","Quantity and variety in fruit and vegetable intake and risk of coronary heart disease","Epidemiological data have consistently documented a protective effect of fruit and vegetable intake on risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Consequently, dietary guidelines recommend increasing fruit and vegetable intake and, most recently, have also suggested increasing variety. Our objective was to examine the independent roles of quantity and variety in fruit and vegetable intake in relation to incident CHD. We prospectively observed 71,157 women from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS, 1984-2008) and 39,752 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS, 1986-2008) who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer at baseline. We documented 2585 incident CHD cases in women during 24 years of follow-up and 3408 cases in men during 22 years of follow-up. Diet was assessed using a standardized and validated questionnaire and updated every 4 years. Variety was defined as the number of unique fruits and vegetables consumed at least once per week. To account for minor differences in the number of fruit and vegetable items administered at each follow-up cycle, we standardized our variety score to 30 (11 for fruit score and 19 for vegetable score). Potatoes, soy, or other legumes were not included in our analyses. Because the AHA does not consider fruit juice to be equivalent to whole fruit, fruit juice was also not included in our analyses. Quantity (servings/day) and variety in fruit and vegetable intake were correlated (r=0.68, P<0.0001). We, therefore, regressed variety on quantity to assess their independent effects on CHD risk. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for dietary and non-dietary covariates, those in the highest fifth of fruit and vegetable intake (median intake=7.80 servings/day) had a 13% lower risk (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.95) of CHD compared to those in the lowest fifth (median intake=2.14 servings/day). Conversely, quantity-adjusted variety was not associated with CHD risk (RR for highest fifth compared to lowest fifth=1.04, 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.19). Further, within each category of quantity, higher variety was not associated with CHD risk. Our data suggest that absolute quantity, rather than variety, in fruit and vegetable intake is associated with a significantly lower risk of CHD. Future work should examine the role of variety in reducing biological markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Meanwhile, policy efforts should continue to focus on increasing overall fruit and vegetable intake.",NA,"*nutrition *ischemic heart disease *vegetable *fruit *risk *medical society *epidemiology *metabolism *diet human follow up female fruit juice male health potato nurse neoplasm cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus questionnaire legume policy endothelial dysfunction inflammation health practitioner epidemiological data biological marker",NA,"127","2013",-1

It was hypothesized that ZEA, an endocrine disruptor, could affect puberty and early pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, newly weaned (3 weeks old) C57BL/6J female mice were exposed to 0, 0.002, 4, 10, and 40 ppm ZEA and 0.05 ppm diethylstilbestrol (positive control) in phytoestrogen-free AIN-93G diet. Females exposed to 10 and 40 ppm ZEA diets showed earlier onset of vaginal opening. Those treated with 40 ppm ZEA diet also had earlier first copulation plug and irregular estrous cyclicity. At 8 weeks old, all females were mated with untreated stud males on AIN-93G diet during mating. Treatment resumed upon identification of a vaginal plug on gestation day 0.5 (D0.5). Embryo implantation was assessed on D4.5. Exposure to 40 ppm ZEA diet resulted in reduced percentage of plugged mice with implantation sites, distended uterine appearance, and retained expression of progesterone receptor in D4.5 uterine epithelium. To determine the exposure timing and mechanisms of disrupted embryo implantation, four groups of females were fed with 0 or 40 ppm ZEA diets during premating (weaning to mating) and postmating (D0.5-D4.5), respectively. Premating exposure to 40 ppm ZEA diet reduced fertilization rate, whereas postmating exposure to 40 ppm ZEA diet delayed embryo transport and preimplantation embryo development, which subsequently affected embryo implantation. These data demonstrate that postweaning exposure to dietary ZEA can promote premature onset of puberty and disrupt early pregnancy events. The Author 2013.

In the present study we analyzed the effects of a chemical agent, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), in eliciting the exudation of nonconjugated isoflavones from intact soybean seeds, embrionary axes and cotyledons. The isoflavones in the exudates were determined by high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The effect of the exudates on the emission of nitric oxide (NO) and on the proliferation of breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) was also evaluated. SNP elicitation increased the production of the aglycone forms dose-and time-dependently. Exudates of embrionary axes and cotyledons stimulated NO emission and showed biphasic effects on viability of MCF-7 cells. At lower concentrations both extracts presented proliferative effects (10-25%), and at higher concentrations inhibited (15%) cell proliferation. The biphasic effect might be due to the action of isoflavone aglycones in activating estrogen receptors which in turn stimulate the production of NO. Overall, the results suggest that soybean extracts enriched in isoflavone aglycones by elicitation with SNP could be exploited as a functional ingredient in the food industry.",NA,"*adenocarcinoma antiproliferative activity article carcinoma cell cell proliferation cell strain MCF 7 cell viability cotyledon DNA content high performance liquid chromatography human human cell plant seed *soybean tandem mass spectrometry daidzein estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein glycitein *isoflavone neutral red *nitric oxide nitroprusside sodium nucleic acid","86-93","23","2013",-1

Dermatologically, Licorice extract is famous ingredient for skin whitening in East-Asian countries. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of licorice extract on melanogenesis in various assay systems which are stimulated with melanogenic agents including alpha-MSH, Endothelin-1 and/or UVB, and figured out the molecular mechanism of depigmentation effect. Licorice extract inhibited melanin synthesis in tobacco extract-stimulated melan-a, mouse melanocytes. Also, Licorice extract inhibited pigmentation in alpha-MSH stimulated mouse melanocytes/keratinocytes (melan-a/SP-1) co-culture system. Even in UVB/Endothelin-1 treated Asian melanocyte-contained human skin-equivalents (MelanoDerm, MEL-300-A), Licorice extract treatment showed decrease of pigmentation as effective as kojic acid. We further investigated the mechanism of Licorice extract on melanogenesis. Licorice extract directly inhibited mushroom tyrosinase activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50=60ppm). Moreover, the real-time PCR revealed that Licorice extract caused dose-dependent down-regulation of melanogenic genes mRNA including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1, and dopachrome tautomerase in melan-a cells. In highest dose Licorice extract treated group, MITF gene expression was reduced to half of untreated control group. In this study, we first found that Licorice extract affected transcriptional down-regulation of melanogenic gene expressions as well as tyrosinase activity inhibition.

Breast density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer, and the mechanism through which it influences cancer risk remains unclear. Breast density has been shown to be modifiable, potentially through dietary modifications. The goal of this paper is to summarize the current studies on diet and diet-related factors across all ages, determine which dietary factors show the strongest association with breast density, the most critical age of exposure, and identify future directions. We identified 28 studies, many of which are cross-sectional, and found that the strongest associations are among vitamin D, calcium, dietary fat, and alcohol in premenopausal women. Longitudinal studies with repeated dietary measures as well as the examination of overall diet over time are needed to confirm these findings. 2013 Jessica Lindgren et al.",NA,"adolescence adulthood alcohol consumption article breast cancer *breast density breast development caloric intake caloric restriction carbohydrate intake *dietary intake fat intake fiber hormone substitution human lifespan *mammary gland function mammography mastectomy premenopause priority journal protein intake red wine risk factor calcium carotenoid isoflavone derivative malonaldehyde/ec [Endogenous Compound] monounsaturated fatty acid polyunsaturated fatty acid somatomedin/ec [Endogenous Compound] vitamin D",NA,"2013","2013",-1

Burke","Cancer and related case studies involving salvestrol and CYP1B1","Salvestrols are naturally occurring, metabolically active substances that act as anticancer prodrugs when metabolically activated by the Cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP1B1. They are phytoalexins and as such are induced in response to pathogens. As phytoalexins they do not fall neatly into any of the classes of phytonutrients. Some are stilbenes, some are antioxidants, some are phytoestrogens while others fall outside of these categories. Salvestrols obtain their anticancer activity not as a member of some phytonutrient class but rather through their metabolism by CYP1B1. Unfortunately, Salvestrols are deficient in western diets due to the modern agricultural practices that minimize the risk of predation through the use of fungicides with the consequence of minimizing the conditions for induction of these compounds. It is in organically grown foods that salvestrol levels are highest. To illustrate the breadth of a nutritional approach to cancer treatment using Salvestrols, cases are presented here that cover stage 1 breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, primary peritoneal carcinoma and a case of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Known host risk factors for IFALD include low birth weight, prematurity, short bowel syndrome, and recurrent sepsis. The literature suggests that components of PN may also play a part of the multifactorial pathophysiology. Because some intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) may contribute to inflammation and interfere with bile excretion, treatment with ILE minimization and/or ILEs composed primarily of omega-3 fatty acids can be helpful, but requires careful monitoring for growth failure and essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD).

An understanding of this can help inform cancer prevention programs. Methods: An online surveywas used to assess the public's perception of cancer risk. Results: 525 people completed the survey. Mean age was 40yrs (range:18-74), 82% were female and 36% had college degrees. 81% were concerned about developing cancer, however 20% believed if cancer was in their family there was nothing they could do about personal cancer risk. 20% did not know that cancer risk increased with age, 27% believed that >50% of cancers are inherited, and 54% believed 10-20% of cancers are inherited. The top 5 risk factors listed by respondents were: smoking 85%, diet 74%, alcohol 44%, genetics 38%, and environment 31%. Only 32% were aware that obesity is a risk factor for cancer and 33% did not think the location of fat was important for cancer prevention. When given a list of potential behaviours relevant to cancer risk 33% believed wearing a tight bra and 49% believed a blow to the breast could increase cancer risk. 87% believed genetics 'strongly' increased risk, 85% stress, and 86% believed cell phones increased risk. 12% believed 'luck' was important in avoiding cancer, 35% thought 'detox' diets and 61% believed organic food reduced risk. Only 33% agreed with the statement that 'frozen vegetables/fruit are as good as fresh', 40% were unaware of the link between red meat and cancer. The following foods were thought to increase risk: cheese (29%), soy (9%), milk chocolate (30%), red wine (25%), and eggs (11%). Aerosol use (71%), cleaning agents (73%), smoking (99%), cooking methods (68%), processed meat (86%), food irradiation (77%), and genetically modified foods (81%) were believed to increased risk. The majority were aware that berries, green tea, garlic, brassica vegetables and physical activity of 30 minutes a day can reduce cancer risk. Conclusions: There is a sizable portion of the population who are misinformed about cancer risk. Most are aware of classic risk factors (e.g. smoking, poor diet).

The animals were randomized into four groups: Sham operated group (Sham), saline treated ovariectomized group (OVX), SG treated group (SG) and raloxifene treated group (RLX). Animals were provided with SG at a dose of 500 mg/kg bw/day and RLX at a dose of 5.4 mg/kg bw/day with standard rat pellets for 3 months.Results: SG significantly increased ERalpha phosphorylation, and its downstream effectors, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation in breast adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment with SG reversed ovariectomy-induced uterine weight reduction and weight gain. Decreases in the levels of GOT and GPT were observed in the SG group. The significantly reduced E2beta level in OVX rats was raised by treatment with SG. Moreover, SG significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt in the uterus.Conclusion: Taken together, these data indicate that SG has phytoestrogen-like properties through ERK and Akt activation, implying that it could be protective and beneficial for the management of menopausal symptoms. 2012 Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"alanine aminotransferase blood level animal experiment article aspartate aminotransferase blood level breast adenocarcinoma cancer cell controlled study drug efficacy *estrogen activity extracellular matrix female human human cell in vitro study in vivo study medicinal plant *menopausal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman *ovariectomy protein blood level protein phosphorylation rat sham procedure treatment duration uterus uterus weight weight gain weight reduction alanine aminotransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] aspartate aminotransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *plant medicinal product/it [Drug Interaction] *plant medicinal product/dt [Drug Therapy] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] sodium chloride *Sutaehwan Gami/it [Drug Interaction] *Sutaehwan Gami/dt [Drug Therapy] *Sutaehwan Gami/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug",NA,"12","2012",-1

The SV40 immortalized cell line (M13SV1) was non-tumorigenic (Kao et al., 1995), the daughter cell lines M13SV1 R2 and M13SV1 R2-N1 have a low and high tumorigenicity respectively, and show a change in tumorigenicity and estrogen response after growth in minimal media (Wang et al., 2010). Isolated isoflavones are currently components of dietary supplements to treat postmenopausal symptoms of women. However, the epidemiological data to the effect of isoflavone intake on breast cancer is contradictory. According to the stem cell theory of carcinogenesis, breast stem cells are the ideal target for the proposed research. Therefore, we want to use these human breast stem cell lines to test the effect of endocrine disruptors, such as soy isoflavones in a human relevant model. Here, we analyzed the effect of the phytoestrogen genistein, the most intensively studied soy protein, on the differentiation of the 3 cell lines. The expression of different luminal epithelial cell markers, estrogen receptors and stem cell markers was measured on the mRNA level by quantitative real time PCR. The analysis of several of these markers was also performed on the protein level using western blot. Additionally, we performed a commercial PCR-Array with a broad number of genes related to breast cancer and estrogen receptor-dependent signal transduction. In parallel we also studied the changes on the protein level using 2D gel electrophoresis, followed by mass spectrometry. We want to use this panel of different markers to establish a toxicological model that can be used in the future to analyze a wide range of different endocrine disruptors.",NA,"*human *model *stem cell *breast female cell line breast cancer carcinogenicity epithelium cell breast feeding diet supplementation real time polymerase chain reaction Western blotting pregnancy daughter cell epithelium carcinogenesis Simian virus 40 cell type epidemiological data menopausal syndrome tissues mammary gland gene signal transduction gel electrophoresis mass spectrometry adult *endocrine disruptor *isoflavone derivative cell marker estrogen receptor protein marker estrogen messenger RNA genistein phytoestrogen soybean protein isoflavone","S81","386","2013",-1

This study has proposed to investigate both in vitro and in vivo action of this agent on murine melanoma. For in vitro analysis, namely ballance proliferation-apoptosis parent B164A5 murine melanoma cell line and high metastaic B16F10 cell line were employed. Dose response curves in the range 1-150muM genistein, after 24 h of incubation were analysed. MTT proliferation assay showed the fallowing values for IC50 genistein: 41,09muM for B164A5 and 64,05muM for B16F10. Additionally cytotoxicity potential determined by simple trypan blue staining indicated 78,2 + 12,49 live cells for B164A5 and 73,2 + 14,82 for B16F10 corresponding the highest chosen concentration of genistein, 150muM. A five day study by CFSE labeling of the cells indicate that genistein reduce remarkable cell division starting from the concentration of 30muM after 48h of incubation for both cell lines. At 100muM after 72h of incubation genistein blocks cell cycle in G2/M phase. Double staining Annexin-FITC-7AAD shows that genistein leads to both early and late apoptosis on the two cell lines directly proportional with the concentration. This compound expresses the pro-apoptotic potential also by inducing caspase-3 cleavage but it dose not affect bax or bcl2 expression at 100muM after 24h of incubation. In vivo results, using the B16 mouse model singenic with the C57BL6J mouse showed that genistein decreased tumor volume by 34,60%. Non-invasive measurements for melanin and erythema demonstrated that genistein reduced the quantity of melanin and the degree of erythema direct proportionally with the number of days of treatment. Histological analyses diagnosed malignant melanoma in the skin of both groups but no metastasis was recorded in the treated group compared to the liver metastasis in the un-treated group (for 60% of the analyzed samples) after a period of 15 days of treatment at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight genistein.

The aim of the study was to identify the breast cancer preventive practices of female employees in Mansoura University. The study was carried out in seventeen Faculties representing all Faculties of Mansoura University. All female employees who worked in the previously mentioned setting during the time of the study were included in the study sample. Their total number was 681 female employees. Based on the current study results, it can be concluded that, most of the female employees have poor knowledge about breast cancer regarding definition, risk factors, signs and symptoms, preventive measures, breast self examination and early detection methods of breast cancer. As for preventive practices, the majority of the studied employees were consuming saturated fat, eating large amount of carbohydrates, did not practice physical exercise and the minority of the female employees was c onsuming soy products as soybeans, tofu, soymilk or soy cheese. As regards screening methods, the majority of the studied employees did not practice breast self examination and also did not perform breast diagnostic investigations as mammogram, CT and MRI. Although the majority of the studied employees had good knowledge about breast cancer yet did not perform breast self examination, clinical breast examination and mammogram.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study where women who have had intervention for uterine fibroids at least once and presented with evidence of recurrence were interviewed and examined and compared with women who had no evidence of uterine fibroids. Case controls were screened at the Diagnostic Unit of the University Hospital of the West Indies, where the absence of uterine fibroids was confirmed via abdominal and/or vaginal ultrasonography. The analysis of urinary isoflavonoids (equol) and a lignan (enterolactone) on spot urine samples was done. Results: There were 38 case controls and 34 cases with recurrent uterine fibroids. Overall 47.2% of the patients had a family history of fibroids (50.0% of those in the fibroid group versus 44.7% of those in the control group). There was a significant association between persons having a family history of fibroids and their current status. Enterolactone and equol levels overall were greater in the recurrent fibroid group than the control. Conclusion: There is a direct association with the levels of phyto-oestrogens excreted and risk of recurrence of uterine fibroids in this population sample.

Methods Fifty ovariectomized rats were randomly divided into five equal groups of ten animals: Control, treated with vehicle; SE46 and SE120, treated with 46 and 120 mg/kg soybean concentrated extract (SE), respectively; EE, treated with conjugated equine estrogens (CE) 50 mug/kg; SE120 + EE, treated with 50 mug/kg (CE) plus 120 mg/kg SE. The substances were administered daily by gavage for 21 consecutive days. Thereafter the animals were weighed and killed by decapitation; trunk blood was collected for hormone determinations. Uteri were removed immediately and fixed in 10% formaldehyde, followed by dehydration, embedding in paraffin and 6-m sections staining with hematoxylin and eosin for histomorphometric analyses of myometrium and endometrium. After ANOVA analysis of the data, the study was complemented with the Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons. Results The concentrated extract of soybean at high concentration (SE 120 kg/mg) and estrogens proved to have a trophic effect on the uterus (endometrium and myometrium) of castrated rats. In groups SE120, EE and SE120 + EE, all morphometric parameters examined (number of glands, eosinophils, blood vessels and the glandular area) were increased. No significant addictive effects of soybean extract plus estrogens were detected in the SE120 + EE group.

Therefore, we evaluated the effects of fish oil (FO) emulsion containing alpha-tocopherol 0.19 g/L on human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and tumors. Methods: HT-29 cell growth, survival, apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation were analyzed after a 24-h incubation with FO 18 to 80 mg/L. Soybean oil (SO) emulsion was used as an isocaloric and isolipidic control. In vivo, nude mice bearing HT-29 tumors were sacrificed 7 d after an 11-d treatment with intravenous injections of FO or SO 0.2 g kg-1 d-1 FO or SO to evaluate tumor growth, necrosis, and lipid peroxidation. Results: The FO inhibited cell viability and clonogenicity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SO showed no significant effect compared with untreated controls. Lipid peroxidation and cell apoptosis after treatment with FO 45 mg/L were increased 2.0-fold (P < 0.01) and 1.6-fold (P = 0.04), respectively. In vivo, FO treatment did not significantly affect tumor growth. However, immunohistochemical analyses of tumor tissue sections showed a decrease of 0.6-fold (P < 0.01) in the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and an increase of 2.3-fold (P = 0.03) in the necrotic area, whereas malondialdehyde and total peroxides were increased by 1.9-fold (P = 0.09) and 7.0-fold (P < 0.01), respectively, in tumors of FO-treated compared with untreated mice.

Bistolarides","A prospective randomized double-blinded trial of topical nsaid therapy for the reduction of pain in women receiving breast radiation for breast cancer","Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer death in American women. Whole breast radiation is given after mastectomy or lumpectomy to prevent breast cancer recurrence. Up to 95% of patients who undergo radiation therapy will experience an inflammatory-mediated skin reaction. Ketoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that helps decrease inflammation and pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. We hypothesize that topical ketoprofen will decrease discomfort in patients undergoing whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer through this mechanism. Methods: Women aged 20 and older undergoing primary treatment for breast cancer, including breast-conserving surgery followed by whole breast radiation therapy without axillary radiation, were enrolled in the study through the local radiation therapy center. Patients were randomized to receive topical 10% ketoprofen in a soy lecithin based cream (study group), or soy lecithin cream (placebo group). Two milliliters of cream was applied daily to the radiated breast for the duration of radiotherapy, typically 6 weeks. Participants completed a weekly subjective pain survey and skin change assessment scale. A nurse or radiation technologist assessed the patient weekly using the Radiation Oncology Toxicity Grading (ROTG) scale. Exclusion criteria included: allergy to soy lecithin or ketoprofen; history of or current peptic ulcer disease, severe CHF, severe coronary artery disease, connective tissue disease; prior radiotherapy; inadequately healed surgical scar within the radiation field or development of skin rash, ulceration or bleeding prior to radiation treatment; concomitant axillary radiation. Results: To date, 37 of 43 enrolled patients have completed the trial. 20 patients received placebo, 17 received ketoprofen. There is no statistical difference in mean reported discomfort score, objective ROTG dermatitis score, or mean patient self-reported skin changes. There were no adverse effects in the study group. Using Cronbach's alpha score, there is a high degree of correlation between the subjective dermatitis score and the subjective survey answers to the ROTG scale (Cronbach's alpha score of 0.6 is considered a high correlation; 0.672 and 0.75 respectively in week 1, 0.902 and 0.727 in week 6). Conclusions: The current results do not support our hypothesis; topical ketoprofen does not decrease discomfort from whole breast radiation dermatitis. The subjective survey with skin change scale used by patients was validated against the accepted ROTG dermatitis scale and provides a valuable tool for future study and clinical practice.",NA,"*human *breast *female *university *radiation *breast cancer *surgery *society *pain *surgeon *therapy patient radiotherapy dermatitis skin partial mastectomy Cronbach alpha coefficient clinical practice prostaglandin synthesis hypothesis mastectomy inflammation bleeding cancer mortality rash radiation field scar connective tissue disease ulcer coronary artery disease peptic ulcer adverse drug reaction allergy toxicity oncology nurse radiation dermatitis skin manifestation neoplasm ketoprofen phosphatidylcholine placebo nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent",NA,"179","2013",-1

Specifically, the effects on the WNT/beta-catenin signalling pathway from GEN were examined by using an azoxymethane (AOM)-induced rat colon cancer model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control (CTL), a soya protein isolate (SPI) or a GEN diet from gestation to 13 weeks of age. The first sampling was conducted at 7 weeks of age for pre-AOM analysis. The remaining rats were injected with AOM at 7 weeks of age. The descending colon was collected 6 weeks later for the evaluation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), gene expression and nuclear protein accumulation. AOM injection induced aberrant nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in the CTL group but not in the SPI or GEN group. Moreover, the WNT target genes Cyclin D1 and c-Myc were repressed by SPI and GEN. Meanwhile, SPI and GEN suppressed the expression of WNT signalling genes including Wnt5a, Sfrp1, Sfrp2 and Sfrp5 to the similar level to that of the pre-AOM period. Rats fed SPI and GEN had a decreased number of total aberrant crypts. GEN feeding also resulted in a reduced number of ACF with N = 3 per foci. The reduction of WNT/beta-catenin signalling was correlated with the decrease in total aberrant crypts. By testing WNT/beta-catenin signalling as a biomarker of colon carcinogenic potential, we showed the novel role of GEN as a suppressor of carcinogen-induced WNT/beta-catenin signalling in preventing the development of early colon neoplasia. 2012 The Authors.",NA,"aberrant crypt focus animal experiment animal model animal tissue article cancer chemotherapy cancer prevention *colon cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *colon cancer/pc [Prevention] controlled study Cyclin D1 gene drug mechanism female gene expression male molecular model nonhuman oncogene c myc protein expression rat sFrp1 gene SFRP2 gene Sfrp5 gene tumor gene upregulation *Wnt signaling pathway wnt5a gene azoxymethane *beta catenin/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] nuclear protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] secreted frizzled related protein 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] secreted frizzled related protein 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] secreted frizzled related protein 5/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor marker/ec [Endogenous Compound] *Wnt protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] Wnt5a protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","33-42","109","2013",-1

A phase 2 placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in forty-seven Norwegian patients before prostatectomy. Intervention was 30 mg genistein or placebo capsules daily for 3-6 weeks. Luminal cells from malignant and benign glands were isolated with laser capture microdissection and the mRNA levels of androgen-related biomarkers (androgen receptor, NK3 homeobox 1, kallikrein-related peptide 4 (KLK4)) and cell cycle-related genes (p21 Waf1/Cip1, p27 Kip1, p53) were analysed with real-time semiquantitative PCR. Immunohistochemistry of androgen-, cell cycle-, proliferative- (Ki67 nuclear antigen), apoptotic- (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and BCL-2-associated X protein) and neuroendocrine differentiation-related biomarkers (neuron-specific enolase and cytoplasmic chromogranin A) was performed using tissue microarrays containing normal, Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 prostate tissues. There were no significant effects by genistein intervention on proliferation-, cell cycle-, apoptosis- or neuroendocrine biomarkers. Genistein intervention, however, significantly reduced the mRNA level of KLK4 in tumour cells (P = 0033) and there was a non-significant reduction in androgen and cell cycle-related biomarkers, except for p27Kip1, whose expression in the nuclear compartment was increased. Genistein intervention modulated the expression of several biomarkers which may be related to PCa prediction and progression. The present study supports genistein as a chemopreventive agent in PCa. Further investigation is warranted in larger and longer-duration studies.

Stottmann","Toward a systems-level understanding of the Hedgehog signaling pathway: Defining the complex, robust, and fragile","The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in development and tissue homeostasis, governing cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as cell fate. Hh signaling is mediated by an intricate network of proteins that have positive and negative roles that work in concert to fine-tune signaling output. Using feedback loops, redundancy and subcellular compartmentalization, the temporal and spatial dynamics of Hh signaling have evolved to be complex and robust. Yet developmental defects and cancers that arise from perturbation of the Hh pathway reflect specific pathway fragilities. Importantly, these fragile nodes and edges present opportunities for the design of targeted therapies. Despite these significant advances, unconnected molecular links within the Hh pathway still remain, many of which revolve around the dependence of Hh signaling on the primary cilium, an antenna-like sensory organelle. A systems-level understanding of Hh signaling and of ciliary biology will comprehensively define all nodes and edges of the Hh signaling network and will help identify precise therapeutic targets. 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,"advanced cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] article basal cell carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cell compartmentalization cell differentiation cell fate cell organelle cell proliferation central nervous system tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] chondrosarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy] colorectal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] drug mechanism esophageal adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] feedback system head and neck cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] hematologic malignancy/dt [Drug Therapy] homeostasis human lung small cell cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] mammal medulloblastoma/dt [Drug Therapy] molecular dynamics myelofibrosis/dt [Drug Therapy] negative feedback nonhuman ovary cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] pancreas adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phase 2 clinical trial (topic) positive feedback recurrent cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] regulatory mechanism sarcoma/dt [Drug Therapy] signal transduction solid tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] stomach adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] bms 833923/dt [Drug Therapy] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] cyclopamine/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] gant 58/pd [Pharmacology] gant 61/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] ipi 269609 itraconazole/pd [Pharmacology] ketoconazole/pd [Pharmacology] leq 506/dt [Drug Therapy] ly 2940680 mk 5710/pd [Pharmacology] mrt 83/pd [Pharmacology] ms 0022/pd [Pharmacology] n (3 methoxybenzyl) 3,3 dimethyl n [1 (3,4 methylenedioxybenzyl) 2 (1 piperazinylcarbonyl) 4 pyrrolidinyl]butyramide norveramiline/pd [Pharmacology] pf 04449913/dt [Drug Therapy] pf 5274857/pd [Pharmacology] physalin F/pd [Pharmacology] resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] saridegib/dt [Drug Therapy] saridegib/pd [Pharmacology] sen 450/pd [Pharmacology] simvastatin/pd [Pharmacology] *sonic hedgehog protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] sonidegib/dt [Drug Therapy] staurosporine/pd [Pharmacology] tak 441/dt [Drug Therapy] triparanol/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug vismodegib/dt [Drug Therapy] vismodegib/pd [Pharmacology] zaragozic acid A/pd [Pharmacology] zerumbone/pd [Pharmacology]","83-100","5","2013",-1

Rockwell","A prospective, multicenter study of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) utilization during definitive radiation for breast cancer","Purpose: Although complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) utilization in breast cancer patients is reported to be high, there are few data on CAM practices in breast patients specifically during radiation. This prospective, multi-institutional study was conducted to define CAM utilization in breast cancer during definitive radiation. Materials/Methods: A validated CAM instrument with a self-skin assessment was administered to 360 Stage 0-III breast cancer patients from 5 centers during the last week of radiation. All data were analyzed to detect significant differences between users/nonusers. Results: CAM usage was reported in 54% of the study cohort (n=194/360). Of CAM users, 71% reported activity-based CAM (eg, Reiki, meditation), 26% topical CAM, and 45% oral CAM. Only 16% received advice/counseling from naturopathic/ homeopathic/medical professionals before initiating CAM. CAM use significantly correlated with higher education level (P<.001), inversely correlated with concomitant hormone/radiation therapy use (P=.010), with a trend toward greater use in younger patients (P=.066). On multivariate analysis, level of education (OR: 6.821, 95% CI: 2.307-20.168, P<.001) and hormones/radiation therapy (OR: 0.573, 95% CI: 0.347-0.949, P=.031) independently predicted for CAM use. Significantly lower skin toxicity scores were reported in CAM users vs nonusers, respectively (mild: 34% vs 25%, severe: 17% vs 29%, P=.017). Conclusion: This is the first prospective study to assess CAM practices in breast patients during radiation, with definition of these practices as the first step for future investigation of CAM/radiation interactions. These results should alert radiation oncologists that a large percentage of breast cancer patients use CAM during radiation without disclosure or consideration for potential interactions, and should encourage increased awareness, communication, and documentation of CAM practices in patients undergoing radiation treatment for breast cancer. 2013 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"acupuncture adult *alternative medicine article awareness *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/rt [Radiotherapy] *breast cancer/th [Therapy] cancer patient cancer staging cohort analysis disease severity education female health care utilization homeopathy human interpersonal communication major clinical study massage medical documentation medical specialist meditation multicenter study paramedical personnel patient counseling priority journal prospective study radiation oncologist reflexology Reiki self evaluation self skin assessment skin toxicity/co [Complication] yoga alpha tocopherol/po [Oral Drug Administration] biotin/po [Oral Drug Administration] calcium/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium/po [Oral Drug Administration] Chlorella extract/dt [Drug Therapy] Cimicifuga racemosa extract/dt [Drug Therapy] copper/po [Oral Drug Administration] Echinacea extract/dt [Drug Therapy] emodin/dt [Drug Therapy] emodin/tp [Topical Drug Administration] folic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration] glutamine/dt [Drug Therapy] grape seed extract/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] magnesium/po [Oral Drug Administration] omega 3 fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] omega 6 fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] primrose oil/dt [Drug Therapy] retinol/po [Oral Drug Administration] selenium/po [Oral Drug Administration] turmeric/dt [Drug Therapy] ubidecarenone/dt [Drug Therapy] ubidecarenone/po [Oral Drug Administration] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/po [Oral Drug Administration] vitamin K group/po [Oral Drug Administration] xanthophyll/dt [Drug Therapy]","40-46","85","2013",-1

Choi","The effect of eqoul, a phytoestrogen, on endothelium-independent vascular reactivity of human uterine artery","Objective: Equol, one class of the phytoestrogen as a metabolite of daidzein is natural nonsteroidal polyphenols of plant origin. Equol has highest bmding affinity to estrogen receptor and antioxidant properties among all isoflavones. Therefore equol may have a promising role as an alternative remedy to HRT for the management of postmenopausal estrogen deficient symptoms & conditions. The purposed of present study is to investigate. 1) whether equol has the direct modulation on vascular tone of endothecium- denuded human uterine artery, and 2) If present, whether this equol-induced modulation of vascular tone is mediated by intracellular calcium modulation through calcium & potassium channels on vascular smooth muscle cell membrane Design: The uterine arteries were obtained at the time of hysterectomy from 15 women without cardiovascular disease and/or risk factors, followed by denudation of vascular endothelium. Vascular reactivity was monitored by using isometric force transducer and recorded by physiograph. Confirmation of no endothelial function and integrity of smooth muscle were done. To investigate the effect of equol on calcium channel in vascular smooth muscle, 2 different kinds of vascular smooth activator were used in the present study. Phenylephrine, receptor-dependent Ca channel agonist & high concentrated potassium chloride solution, voltage-dependent calcium channel agonist were used. The uterine smooth muscles were pretreated with phenylephrine, 103 & high concentrated potassium chloride solution 70mM. The equol at 6 different concentrations from 10'M to lO^M were used for the evaluation of modulatory action of equol on precontracted vascular smooth muscle by phenylephrine, 10~5 & high concentrated potassium chloride solution 70mM. After pretreatment by equol 10*for 30 min, phenylephrine induced contraction from 10-9M to 10-4M concentration 8M & high KC1 induced contraction from 35 to 140mM was compared with the results without equol pretreatment. To investigate the effect of equol on potassium channel in vascular smooth muscle, 2 kinds of K channel antagonist, tetraethylammomum & 4-aminopyridine were used. After pretreatment by these 2 K+ channel antagonists for 30 minutes, the cumulative concentration-response for equol were determined on phynylephrine-induced contractions and compared with the results without pretreatment Results: Equol 10-11M to 10-6M in concentration showed relaxation effect on vascular smooth muscle contraction which was induced by phenylephrine 10-5M. This relaxation effect of equol was dose-dependent. Equol in same concentrations showed no significant effects on vascular smooth muscle contraction induced by high concentration KCI solution. Phenylephrine-induce contraction was markedly reduced from 10-7 to 10-4M in concentration by pretreatment of equol, but high KCI-induced contraction was not affected by pretreatment of equol. Equol-induced relaxation in 6 kinds of concentration, on phenylephrine induced contraction was not affected by pretreatment of tetraethylammomum lOmM or 4-aminopyridine 10-5M Conclusion: This results suggested that equol induced endothelium-independent vasorelaxation. This vasorelaxation effect of equol may be induced by calcium antagonistic action, which was mediated through antagonistic action for receptor- dependent calcium channel, but not for voltage-dependent calcium channel in vascular smooth muscle. The vasorelaxation effect of equol was not affected by K* channel blockers, suggesting no role of K+channel on this relaxation action.

The use of hypoallergenic formulas is considered the alternative proposed. Currently there are three types of formulas that can be indicated in the dietary treatment of allergy in infants: Soy Protein based formulas, extensively hydrolyzed casein formulas, and free amino acids based formulas. The soy formulas have high amounts of phytate, aluminum and phytoestrogens that can bring undesirable effects to child health. Therefore, the objective of this review was to describe the adverse effects of the use of soy formula in infants. This study was a systematic review by searching the electronic databases Pubmed and Biblioteca Virtual em Saude, whose sources of information to Cochrane, SciELO, LILACS and MEDLINE. The articles were selected from the reading of the abstracts that should provide the following information: the content of phytoestrogens and / or aluminum in soy formula compared to other formulas and breast milk and its possible consequences, evaluation of growth of infants fed with soy formula and review articles were excluded. Have been created three cards from extraction of information from selected articles, first of all have been identified 210 articles, 19 were selected for full reading, and only 14 were included in the review for meeting all inclusion criteria. The articles dated from 1994 to 2012 and represented 7 countries: United States (42.9%), Italy (14.3%), United Kingdom (14.3%), Spain (7.1%), Finland (7.1%), Canada (7.1%) and New Zealand (7.1%). Five studies addressed the issue of growth and development of infants fed with soy formula, five discussed the amount of phytoestrogens in soy formula and other four aluminum. As for weight of the infants, only one study reported a reduction in infants fed with soy formula. Other studies showed extremely higher amounts of isoflavones and aluminum in soy formula when compared to milk-based formula or breast milk.

Objectives: The study aimed to characterize the mutation G1793A of the gene encoding the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and environmental factors in women with breast cancer. Methods: The sample consisted of 35 women with breast cancer, treated at a Basic Health Unit in the city of Itajai - SC. Gene and allelic frequency were determined from polymorphism G1793A. Anthropometric data was collected and a clinical and a food frequency questionnaire were apllied. The presence of the mutation G1793A was determined through the amplification of the fragment exon 11 of the MTHFR gene by PCR-RFLP. Results: The results showed heterozygous genotype frequency of 5.71% for the G1793A mutation. The average age of the sample was 56 years, most women were overweight, had no family history of breast cancer, past use of oral contraceptive, had gone through mammography and had breast fed, multiparity and were postmenopausal. Coffee, milk and soy bean oil were the daily most consumed foods. Conclusions: It concludes that G1793A genotype showed a low frequency in the population studied. The environmental factors checked in the women were unfavorable socioeconomic conditions, physical inactivity, obesity, multiparity, low exclusive breastfeeding duration, high fat intake including high red meat consumption and low consumption of fruits and vegetables. Considering the low genotype frequency of the G1793A mutation, we suggest the development of case-control studies with a larger sample size, to be possible to do associations between environmental risk factors and gene mutation.",NA,"*gene *environmental factor *female *human *breast cancer *society *mutation genotype risk factor obesity multipara family history milk etiology city mammography case control study vegetable sample size breast health center coffee fruit red meat fat intake immobilization population exon food food frequency questionnaire gene frequency gene mutation restriction fragment length polymorphism *enzyme *5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2) oral contraceptive agent soybean oil","282","5","2012",-1

Ong","The epigenome as a promising target for breast cancer prevention with bioactive food compounds","Epigenetic deregulation manifests throughout the carcinogenic process and have been implicated in breast cancer development. Global DNA hypomethylation, gene promoter hypermethylation and histone onco-modifications are associated with genomic instability and aberrant expression profiles of genes involved with cell proliferation, death and differentiation in breast cancer cells. Bioactive food compounds with anticancer potential include polyphenols from tea, soy and curcuma, sulfur-containing compounds from cruciferous vegetables, selenium, folic acid, retinoids and fatty acids. Accumulating evidence shows that these dietary bioactive compounds modulate epigenetic processes by interefering with different components of the epigenetic machinery. Because epigenetic marks are potentially reversible and early altered during carcinogenesis, the epigenome represents a promising target for breast cancer prevention with bioactive food compounds. Furthermore, because diet-epigenome interactions are likely to occur in utero, the impact of earlylife nutrition on breast cancer risk programming should be further investigated.",NA,"*breast cancer *cancer prevention *food *society genomic instability DNA methylation promoter region cancer cell vegetable gene cell proliferation cancer risk Curcuma diet carcinogenesis machine nutrition deregulation death histone retinoid polyphenol sulfur selenium folic acid fatty acid DNA","185","5","2012",-1

Therefore, they have been widely used as flame retardant additives in plastics, computer, construction materials, electronic equipment and textiles during the past three decades. However, these compounds are resistant to degradation and can be accumulated in the food chain and transported from mother to her offspring due to their lipophilic properties. So, PBDEs are considered as emerging persistent organic pollutants. Objective: PBDEs were known as thyroid hormone transport disruptor in liver and potential disrupting thyroid hormone. So this study were performed to investigate the concentration level of PBDEs in congenital hypothyroidism(CH) patients & their mothers compared with normal control in Korea. Methods: All samples were collected from volunteers-40 CH patients and 20 normal controls. The amount of PBDEs in blood samples was measured by HRGC/HRMS. Results: The PBDEs level in blood samples was ranged from 2.81 to 14.92 ng/g lipid (mean: 6.34 + 3.81 ng/g lipid) in CH patients, 0.87 to 12.26 ng/g lipid (mean: 4.54 + 3.81 ng/g lipid) in mother of CH patients. The PBDEs level was ranged from 4.29 to 10.69 ng/g lipid (mean: 7.69 + 3.37 ng/g lipid) in normal control infants, 1.36 to 14.38 ng/g lipid (mean: 7.63 + 3.83 ng/g lipid) in mother of normal control infants. There were no statistically significant correlation between the PBDE concentration level and TSH & FreeT4 level in each group. Conclusion: This is the first study about correlation between PBDEs and CH in Korea. Different from well-known knowledge that PBDEs affect thyroid function, there were no correlation between mean concentration level of PB- DEs and CH.

Lleonart","Stem cell MicroRNAs in senescence and immortalization: Novel players in cancer therapy","The molecular etiology of malignancy remains one of the most challenging disease processes under scientific investigation; therefore, improved approaches for their treatment are urgently needed. MicroRNAs are highly conserved nonprotein-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. They are involved in important homeostatic processes, such as cellular proliferation, cell death and development, and affect many diseases, including cancer. High-throughput screenings based on microRNAs related to senescence/immortalization are potential tools for identifying novel proliferative microRNAs that might be involved in carcinogenesis. Recently, a subgroup of highly proliferative microRNAs, which belong to a cluster expressed exclusively in embryonic stem cells and their malignant derivatives (embryonic carcinoma cells), was revealed to play a role in senescence bypass, thereby providing immortalization to human cells. This finding supports the cancer stem cell theory and the relevance of microRNAs in human tumors. This article recapitulates the role of microRNAs that are associated with stem cell properties and their possible link in common pathways related to immortalization and cancer. Ultimately, cancer therapy that is based on the induction of a senescence response is proposed to be highly associated with the loss of stemness properties. Thus, it would be possible to ""kill two birds with one stone"": along with the inhibition of stemness properties in cancer stem cells, the senescence response could be induced to destroy the cancer stem cell population within a tumor. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,"antineoplastic activity article biogenesis cancer cell destruction cancer chemotherapy cancer prognosis *cancer stem cell *cancer therapy *cell aging cell hypoxia *cell immortalization chemical modification CpG island DNA methylation embryonic stem cell epigenetics epithelial mesenchymal transition gene expression regulation gene overexpression genetic variability human lung cancer lymph node metastasis mammal cell oxidative stress pancreas cancer posttranscriptional gene silencing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia protein expression receptor down regulation receptor upregulation stem cell transplantation 3,3' diindolylmethane 5 aza 2' deoxycytidine apicidin biological marker/ec [Endogenous Compound] butyric acid curcumin cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B/ec [Endogenous Compound] dacinostat depsipeptide entinostat estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] gemcitabine histone deacetylase inhibitor isoflavone *microRNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 21/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 223/ec [Endogenous Compound] microRNA 25/ec [Endogenous Compound] microrna let 7/ec [Endogenous Compound] octamer transcription factor 4/ec [Endogenous Compound] oligoribonucleotide tacedinaline transcription factor NANOG/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Sox2/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Sp1/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor ZEB1/ec [Endogenous Compound] trapoxin trichostatin A unclassified drug valproic acid","112-138","33","2013",-1

However, the mechanism of cytotoxicity has not been clearly defined. It has previously been reported that HER2/ERBB2, the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and p53 were required for flavonoid induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines. We have used a panel of breast cancer cell lines, known to contain as well as be deficient in these signaling pathways, to screen fourteen different flavonoids. Comparing the cytotoxicity for all flavonoids allows us to determine if a structure-functional relationship exists between cytotoxicity and flavonoid, and if a particular signaling pathway is required for cytotoxicity. We show that several flavonoids are cytotoxic to all cell lines including primary mammary epithelial cells tested. The cytotoxic flavonoids are also able to inhibit Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeability while at the same time stimulate ATP levels whereas the non-cytotoxic flavonoids are not able to do this. We also show that both cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic flavonoids can transverse the cell membrane to enter MDA-MB-231 cells at different levels. Finally, all flavonoids regardless of their cytotoxicity were able to induce some form of cell cycle arrest. We conclude that for flavonoids to be strongly cytotoxic, they must possess the 2,3-double bond in the C-ring and we believe the cytotoxicity occurs through mitochondrial poisoning in both cancer and normal cells.",NA,"*antineoplastic activity article *breast cancer breast epithelium cancer cell cell cycle arrest cell membrane chemical bond controlled study *drug cytotoxicity epithelium cell human human cell membrane permeability mitochondrial membrane outer membrane signal transduction *structure activity relation adenosine triphosphate/ec [Endogenous Compound] apigenin/an [Drug Analysis] apigenin/cm [Drug Comparison] apigenin/to [Drug Toxicity] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] catechin/an [Drug Analysis] catechin/cm [Drug Comparison] catechin/to [Drug Toxicity] catechin/pd [Pharmacology] chrysin/an [Drug Analysis] chrysin/cm [Drug Comparison] chrysin/to [Drug Toxicity] chrysin/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein/an [Drug Analysis] daidzein/cm [Drug Comparison] daidzein/to [Drug Toxicity] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *flavonoid/an [Drug Analysis] *flavonoid/cb [Drug Combination] *flavonoid/cm [Drug Comparison] *flavonoid/to [Drug Toxicity] *flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] kaempferol/an [Drug Analysis] kaempferol/cb [Drug Combination] kaempferol/cm [Drug Comparison] kaempferol/to [Drug Toxicity] kaempferol/pd [Pharmacology] luteolin/an [Drug Analysis] luteolin/cm [Drug Comparison] luteolin/to [Drug Toxicity] luteolin/pd [Pharmacology] methylapigenin/an [Drug Analysis] methylapigenin/cm [Drug Comparison] methylapigenin/to [Drug Toxicity] methylapigenin/pd [Pharmacology] methylluteolin/an [Drug Analysis] methylluteolin/cb [Drug Combination] methylluteolin/cm [Drug Comparison] methylluteolin/to [Drug Toxicity] methylluteolin/pd [Pharmacology] methylnaringenin/an [Drug Analysis] methylnaringenin/cm [Drug Comparison] methylnaringenin/to [Drug Toxicity] methylnaringenin/pd [Pharmacology] methylquercetin/an [Drug Analysis] methylquercetin/cm [Drug Comparison] methylquercetin/to [Drug Toxicity] methylquercetin/pd [Pharmacology] myricetin/an [Drug Analysis] myricetin/cb [Drug Combination] myricetin/cm [Drug Comparison] myricetin/to [Drug Toxicity] myricetin/pd [Pharmacology] naringenin/an [Drug Analysis] naringenin/cm [Drug Comparison] naringenin/to [Drug Toxicity] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] progesterone receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein p53/ec [Endogenous Compound] quercetin/an [Drug Analysis] quercetin/cb [Drug Combination] quercetin/cm [Drug Comparison] quercetin/to [Drug Toxicity] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","1295-1304","7","2012",-1

Unfortunately, animal models of chronic ethanol consumption with estrogen deficiency are lacking. Here, we characterize the ability of the agar block and Lieber-DeCarli models of chronic ethanol consumption to produce elevated blood alcohol content (BAC) and liver pathology in the F344 postmenopausal animal model of aging. Methods: Adult (3 mo) and aged (18 mo) F344 ovary-intact or ovariectomized rats were administered ethanol for 14-20 weeks as follows: diet 1, standard chow access, 10% ethanol in drinking water, and 40% ethanol in agar blocks; diet 2, diet 1 plus low phytoestrogen chow (known to affect ethanol metabolism) for the final 4 weeks; diet 3, Lieber-DeCarli all liquid diet with 36% kcal ethanol. Control animals were matched isocalorically with dextrin. Results: For the agar block diet, average BAC was 13+4 mg/dL across groups. BAC was unaffected by reducing dietary phytoestrogen content (12+4 mg/dL), which is known to interfere with ethanol metabolism. Liver pathology was unaffected by the agar block diet. In contrast, the Lieber-DeCarli diet resulted in BAC of 45+5 mg/dL in conjunction with more severe hepatopathology. Discussion: We conclude that the Lieber-DeCarli diet produces greater BAC and hepatopathology to study the effects of chronic ethanol administration in the F344 postmenopausal rodent model of aging when compared to an ethanol agar block diet. 2012 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"*aging alcohol blood level *alcohol consumption alcohol metabolism *alcoholism animal cell article body weight controlled study *dietary intake female histopathology liver disease nonhuman ovariectomy postmenopause rat senescence uterus weight weight gain *alcohol/to [Drug Toxicity] dextrin phytoestrogen/to [Drug Toxicity]","257-263","66","2012",-1

Tea, soy, cruciferous vegetables and other foods have been investigated for their cancer preventive potential. Some non-edible mushrooms like Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) have a history use, both alone and in conjunction with standard therapies, for the treatment of various diseases including cancer in some cultures. They have shown efficacy in a number of scientific studies. By comparison, the potential cancer preventive effects of edible mushrooms have been less well-studied. With similar content of putative effective anticancer compounds such as polysaccharides, proteoglycans, steroids, etc., one might predict that edible mushrooms would also demonstrate anticancer and cancer preventive activity.

There is an immediate need for more effective and less toxic therapeutic and preventive strategies for many cancers, especially for breast cancer. Natural products are being tested with a hope of identifying novel potent molecules as anticancer agents. Phytochemicals and dietary compounds have been used for the treatment of various illnesses throughout history due to their safety, low toxicity, and general availability. Currently, many active phytochemicals are in clinical trials. Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that daily consumption of dietary phytochemicals reduces the risk of several cancers. Phytochemicals can inhibit, delay, or reverse carcinogenesis by inducing detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes, by regulating inflammatory/proliferative signaling pathways, and by inducing apoptosis.

Angelamaria","Herbal drugs and food supplements in menopause","Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds with many and interesting biological activities, whose molecular structure shows some analogies with estradiol. Since the climacteric syndrome has been treated pharmacologically, there has been a parallel demand for alternative treatments to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) due to the impossibility of some women to take hormones and the mistrust of others for this therapy. Studies conducted in the last century have observed that the populations who take soybeans in their diet every day can have some benefits in preventing the appearance of both climacteric symptoms and hormone-dependent tumours (breast and endometrial cancer). Therefore, many researchers have investigated the activities of phytoestrogens, and especially of genistein and diadzein contained in soybeans and in other vegetal substances. Phytoestrogens act as natural selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) and interact both with estrogen receptor alpha (ER- alpha) and, much more, with estrogen receptor beta (ER-beta) with both genomic and non-genomic effects. Various studies have shown that these substances are much more effective than placebo in relieving the climacteric symptoms. On the other hand, many other studies have denied this effect. Other studies have demonstrated that the genistein can control bone resorption in women after menopause but these data are controversial and there is no unanimity in the literature. Nevertheless, the therapeutic use of phytoestrogens in post-menopausalwomen has spread considerably in theWestern countries and Italy, mostly because, besides any possible placebo effect, there is no clinical evidence of undesired reactions, except for a very small number of women. It is therefore of interest-at least speculatively-to use the genistein as an anti-oestrogen substance in the endometrial hyperplasia of perimenopause.

Thus, the chemoprevention of cancer differs from therapy in that the goal of prevention is to lower the rate of cancer incidence. Such chemopreventive agents are also known as anticarcinogens. The use of specific nutrients other chemical compound in the prevention of cancer is referred to as chemoprevention. The aim of cancer chemopreven-tion is to circumvent the development and progression of precancerous cells through the use of non-cytotoxic nutrients and/or pharmacologic agents. Although decreasing cancer incidence and mortality is the ultimate goal of chemoprevention, much effort is being devoted towards identifying specific steps in the carcinogenesis process that are amenable to intervention and that can serve as surrogate endpoint biomar-kers for possible modulation by chemopreventive agents. There appear to be at least two basic mechanisms by which chemical agents with relatively low toxicity may inhibit carcinogenesis. Chemopreventive agents can also identified by systematic evaluation of agent that acts at specific molecular targets with respect to cancer by using laboratory assay.

Tong","Rat alpha-fetoprotein binding affinities of a large set of structurally diverse chemicals elucidated the relationships between structures and binding affinities","Endocrine disrupting chemicals interfere with the endocrine system in animals, including humans, to exert adverse effects. One of the mechanisms of endocrine disruption is through the binding of receptors such as the estrogen receptor (ER) in target cells. The concentration of any chemical in serum is important for its entry into the target cells to bind the receptors. alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a major transport protein in rodent serum that can bind with estrogens and thus change a chemical's availability for entrance into the target cell. Sequestration of an estrogen in the serum can alter the chemical's potential for disrupting estrogen receptor-mediated responses. To better understand endocrine disruption, we developed a competitive binding assay using rat amniotic fluid, which contains very high levels of AFP, and measured the binding to the rat AFP for 125 structurally diverse chemicals, most of which are known to bind ER. Fifty-three chemicals were able to bind the rat AFP in the assay, while 72 chemicals were determined to be nonbinders. Observations from closely examining the relationship between the binding data and structures of the tested chemicals are rationally explained in a manner consistent with proposed binding regions of rat AFP in the literature. The data reported here represent the largest data set of structurally diverse chemicals tested for rat AFP binding. The data assist in elucidating binding interactions and mechanisms between chemicals and rat AFP and, in turn, assist in the evaluation of the endocrine disrupting potential of chemicals.

In vitro, ER3 has dominant negative activity, suggesting it may suppress estrogen stimulation in the breast. ER3 may inhibit classical signaling on estrogen response element (ERE)-regulated genes as well as activate non-classical pathways at Sp1 and AP-1 sites. Transgenic mice were developed that express mouse ER3 in all tissues examined, including the mammary gland. To investigate if ER3 expression affects tumorigenesis, ER3 mice were crossbred with MMTV-Neu mice. Mammary tumor onset was significantly delayed in ER3/Neu versus MMTV-Neu females and metastatic incidence and burden was significantly reduced. Consequently, ER3 expression suppressed tumor development and metastasis in this aggressive model of HER2/Neu-positive breast cancer. To determine if ER ligands with anticancer activity may augment ER3 protection, the bitransgenic mice were treated with tamoxifen and soy isoflavones starting at age 2 months. Soy protein with isoflavones (181 mg/1,800 kcal) did not affect tumor development in MMTV-Neu or ER3/Neu mice; however, metastatic progression was not inhibited in soy-treated ER3/Neu mice, as it was in untreated ER3/Neu mice. In contrast, tamoxifen (20 mg/1,800 kcal) significantly enhanced tumor prevention in ER3/Neu versus MMTV-Neu mice (98% vs. 81% tumor free). The results in ER3/Neu mice demonstrate that ER3 influences estrogen-dependent mammary carcinogenesis and, thus, may be protective in women expressing ER3 in the breast. However, exposure to different estrogens may augment or block its beneficial effects. 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article *breast cancer breast tumor controlled study *exon female gene deletion gene expression in vitro study metastasis mouse nonhuman priority journal transgenic mouse epidermal growth factor receptor 2 *estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone tamoxifen","227-239","3","2012",-1

We previously demonstrated that oviducts of genistein-treated mice are ""posteriorized""as compared to control mouse oviducts because they express numerous genes normally restricted to posterior regions of the female reproductive tract (FRT), the cervix and vagina. We report here that neonatal genistein treatment resulted in substantial changes in oviduct expression of genes important for the FRT mucosal immune response, including immunoglobulins, antimicrobials, and chemokines. Some of the altered immune response genes were chronically altered beginning at the time of neonatal genistein treatment, indicating that these alterations were a result of the posteriorization phenotype. Other alterations in oviduct gene expression were observed only in early pregnancy, immediately after the FRT was exposed to inflammatory or antigenic stimuli from ovulation and mating. The oviduct changes affected development of the surviving embryos by increasing the rate of cleavage and decreasing the trophectoderm-to-inner cell mass cell ratio at the blastocyst stage. We conclude that both altered immune responses to pregnancy and deficits in oviduct support for preimplantation embryo development in the neonatal genistein model are likely to contribute to infertility phenotype. 2012 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article blastocyst controlled study *embryo development enzyme linked immunosorbent assay female female infertility gene expression histology *immune response immunohistochemistry inner cell mass male microarray analysis mouse nonhuman oviduct phenotype *pregnancy *preimplantation embryo priority journal real time polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction uterine cervix vagina antiinfective agent chemokine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein immunoglobulin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","10","87","2012",-1

Gastrointestinal side effects of food hypersensitivity may lead to PLE. We describe a case of a child with anasarca due to PLE as the sole presentation of food hypersensitivity. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient is a 17-month-old previously healthy male who presented with progressive, generalized edema and weight gain over one month. No gastrointestinal symptoms were noted, with the child only having 1-2 normal stools per day. The patient was breast fed for his first 12 months after which he was transitioned to cow's milk without obvious adverse effect. Solids were successfully introduced starting at 4 months and included fruits and vegetables, grains, meats, and egg. Family history was remarkable for peanut allergy in his brother. Physical examination was only positive for significant anasarca with pitting edema of the hands, feet, legs, and periorbital regions. Serum electrolytes, urinalysis, liver and kidney functions were within normal limits. Serum albumin was noted to be very low at 1.3 g/dL and stool alpha-1-antitrypsin was significantly elevated at 17 mg/g. Serum IgG level was also decreased at 125 mg/dL. The patient's labs were consistent with malabsorption with secondary iron deficiency anemia: hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, MCV 68.6 fL, and ferritin of 3 ng/mL. The patient had peripheral eosinophilia at 848 cells/mL and testing for food specific IgE levels showed levels to egg 10.7 kU/L, cow's milk 10.4 kU/L, soy 7.8 kU/L, wheat 10.7 kU/L, and peanut 2.2 kU/L. Endoscopy to look for eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease was unable to be performed the time of our consult secondary to symptoms of acute RSV bronchiolitis. All foods with positive IgE levels were pulled from the patient's diet and he was started on EleCare. On follow-up evaluation 3 weeks later, the patient's anasarca had completely resolved and albumin, IgG level, and hemoglobin had normalized. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates anasarca secondary to PLE as a unique, single symptom in the presentation of food hypersensitivity with lack of clinical features often found in children with either PLE or IgE-mediated food allergy.

It is caused by dysfunctional regulatory T-cells secondary to a mutation in the Foxp3 gene. The common triad of symptoms found in IPEX syndrome consists of dermatitis, insulin-dependent diabetes, and enteropathy. Methods:We report the rare case of a 2 monthold male who presented with chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, and severe atopic dermatitis and demonstrated lab abnormalities and gene analysis diagnostic of IPEX Syndrome. Results: Our patient's initial absolute eosinophil count was 3130/uL and IgE concentration was 7117 IU/mL. His specific IgE to foods were elevated to milk (41.8 IU/mL), soy (14.1 IU/mL), peanut (21.7 IU/mL), and watermelon (0.43 IU/mL). Initial autoimmune workup was positive for anti-enterocyte antibodies, but negative for anti-islet (GAD65) and anti-thyroid antibodies. Pancreatic elastase was very low, indicating severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. His immunoglobulins were normal, as were his lymphocyte subsets, specifically CD4+ (2139/uL) and CD4+CD25+ (17%). Genetic analysis revealed a Foxp3 missense mutation at position 386 resulting in an amino acid substitution (Arginine > Histidine). After treatmentwas started with Sirolimus, his diarrhea and rash completely resolved and he began gaining weight. His absolute eosinophil count normalized to 110/uL, and his IgE level decreased substantially to 297 IU/mL. Conclusion: IPEX syndrome elucidates the role of the Foxp3 gene for the generation of properly functioning regulatory T cells. Current treatment methods include immunosuppressive agents and bone marrow transplantation. There are significant risks to both regimens, and patients still often succumb either to the disease or to the adverse effects of treatment, such as infection or lymphoproliferative disease. Patients with less autoimmune damage prior to transplantation have better outcomes.

However, the action of poncirin in bone biology is unclear. In this study, the in vivo and in vitro effects of poncirin in a glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO) mouse model were investigated. Sevenmonth-old male mice were assigned to the following five groups: (1) sham-implantation (sham), (2) prednisolone 2.1 mg/kg/day (GC), (3) GC treated with 10 mg/kg/day of genistein, (4) GC treated with 3 mg/kg/day of poncirin, (5) and GC treated with 10 mg/kg/day of strontium (GC + SrCl 2). After 8 weeks, bone loss was measured by micro-computed tomography. Osteocalcin (OC) and C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) were evaluated in sera. Runx2 protein, OC and osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA expression, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and mineral nodule assay were performed in C3H10T1/2 or primary bone marrow stromal cells. Poncirin significantly increased the bone mineral density and improved the microarchitecture. Poncirin increased serum OC, Runx2 protein production, expression of OC and OPG mRNA, ALP activity, and mineral nodule formation; and decreased serum CTX. These effects were more prominent in the poncirin group compared to the other positive control groups (genistein and strontium). The poncirin-mediated restoration of biochemical bone markers, increased bone mineral density, and improved trabecular microarchitecture likely reflect increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption in GIO mice.

"593","503"," J. Peedicayil","The role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis and treatment of cancer","DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism that leads to inhibition of gene transcription and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of cancer. The effectors of DNA methylation are DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) that catalyze either de novo or maintenance methylation of hemimethylated DNA after DNA replication. DNA methylation patterns in cancer are distorted, with three ways by which DNA methylation contributes to cancer: hypomethylation of the cancer genome, focal hypermethylation of the promoters of tumour suppressor genes, and direct mutagenesis. Drugs that inhibit DNMTs are proving to be useful in the treatment of cancer with a few such drugs approved for clinical use. These drugs include nucleoside inhibitors, non-nucleoside inhibitors, oligonucleotides, and noncoding RNAs that target messenger RNAs of genes encoding DNMTs. The major value of DNMT inhibitors could be that at low doses they can induce the re-expression of aberrantly silenced tumour suppressor genes, allowing cancer cells to revert to a normal phenotype and/or reacquire cellular pathways needed for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induction. They could also be useful in combination with other anticancer drugs. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"acute granulocytic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy] apoptosis article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer cell *cancer therapy cell cycle regulation chronic myeloid leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy] colorectal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] colorectal cancer/rt [Radiotherapy] CpG island *DNA methylation DNA replication DNA sequence drug mechanism enzyme inhibition enzyme substrate epigenetics gene expression gene mutation gene silencing genetic transcription glioblastoma/dt [Drug Therapy] human ionizing radiation liver cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] lung cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] mouth squamous cell carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] myelodysplastic syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman *pathogenesis phenotype priority journal promoter region prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] signal transduction skin cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] solid tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] treatment response tumor suppressor gene 5 aza 2' deoxycytidine/cb [Drug Combination] 5 aza 2' deoxycytidine/cm [Drug Comparison] 5 aza 2' deoxycytidine/dt [Drug Therapy] 5 aza 2' deoxycytidine/pd [Pharmacology] antineoplastic agent/cb [Drug Combination] antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] azacitidine/cb [Drug Combination] azacitidine/cm [Drug Comparison] azacitidine/dt [Drug Therapy] azacitidine/pd [Pharmacology] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] catechin/pd [Pharmacology] cytotoxic agent/cb [Drug Combination] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] disulfiram/dt [Drug Therapy] disulfiram/pd [Pharmacology] DNA methyltransferase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] DNA methyltransferase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] epicatechin/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin gallate/dt [Drug Therapy] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] fisetin/pd [Pharmacology] flucytosine deoxyriboside/ct [Clinical Trial] flucytosine deoxyriboside/dt [Drug Therapy] flucytosine deoxyriboside/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] histone deacetylase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] hydralazine/ct [Clinical Trial] hydralazine/dt [Drug Therapy] hydralazine/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] lenalidomide/cb [Drug Combination] lenalidomide/dt [Drug Therapy] mg 98/ct [Clinical Trial] mg 98/dt [Drug Therapy] mg 98/pd [Pharmacology] mithramycin/dt [Drug Therapy] mithramycin/pd [Pharmacology] mitoxantrone/dt [Drug Therapy] mitoxantrone/pd [Pharmacology] myricetin/pd [Pharmacology] n phthaloyltryptophan/dt [Drug Therapy] n phthaloyltryptophan/pd [Pharmacology] parthenolide/dt [Drug Therapy] procainamide/dt [Drug Therapy] procainamide/pd [Pharmacology] procaine/dt [Drug Therapy] procaine/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] unindexed drug valproic acid/cb [Drug Combination] valproic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] zebularine/cm [Drug Comparison] zebularine/dt [Drug Therapy] zebularine/po [Oral Drug Administration] zebularine/pd [Pharmacology]","333-340","7","2012",-1

In particular an inverse relationship of oily fish intake to coronary heart disease incidence has been established. These beneficial effects are ascribed to fish oil components including long chain -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival; however, cisplatin treatment is associated with toxicity to healthy cells. Genistein has been used as an adjunct to chemotherapy to enhance the activity of chemotherapeutic agents without causing increased toxicity. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of genistein (25 muM) on antitumor activity of cisplatin (250 nM) on HeLa cervical cancer cells. We have examined the alterations in expression of NF-B, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K1, p-4E-BP1, and p-Akt protein levels in response to treatment. The combination of 25 muM genistein with 250 nM cisplatin resulted in significantly greater growth inhibition (P0.01). Genistein enhanced the antitumor activity of cisplatin and reduced the expression of NF-B, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K1, p-4E-BP1, and p-Akt. The results in the present study suggest that genistein could enhance the activity of cisplatin via inhibition of NF-B and Akt/mTOR pathways. Genistein is a promising nontoxic nutritional agent that may enhance treatment outcome in cervical cancer patients when given concomitantly with cisplatin. Clinical trials of genistein and cisplatin combination are warranted to test this hypothesis. 2012 K.

It has been reported to possess diverse biological properties and their therapeutic properties propel them to evaluate against various experimental diseases. We have reported here the protective role of d-Pinitol on renal and hepatic tissue against oxidative stress mediated experimental breast cancer model. DMBA, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, was used to induce breast cancer in female Sprague Dawley rats with single oral dose of 20 mg/kg/body weight diluted in corn oil. The cancer-bearing rats were treated with the natural dietary compound d-Pinitol at the concentration of 200 mg/kg/body weight orally for 45 days. We observed that d-Pinitol significantly restored the elevated levels of marker enzymes such as ALT, AST and LDH and efficiently down regulates lipid per-oxidation and lysosomal enzymes. The antioxidants levels were found to be significantly enhanced and the carbohydrate key metabolizing enzymes were excellently modulated towards normal range. These biochemical alterations were well reflected in the histopathological studies of liver and kidney tissues of control and experimental groups. Thus, the hepatic and renal tissue protective property might be due to the antioxidant activity which might reduce the per-oxidation reaction that were induced by DMBA and also render protection to the membrane integrity through its firm antioxidant property and modulatory role with prominent intervention strategies in gluconeogenesis process and lysosomal enzymes. 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Simmen","Cytosolic Malic Enzyme 1 (ME1) Mediates High Fat Diet-Induced Adiposity, Endocrine Profile, and Gastrointestinal Tract Proliferation-Associated Biomarkers in Male Mice","Background: Obesity and associated hormonal disturbances are risk factors for colon cancer. Cytosolic Malic Enzyme (ME1) generates NADPH used for lipogenesis in gastrointestinal (GI), liver and adipose tissues. We have reported that inclusion of soy protein isolate (SPI) in the diet lowered body fat content and colon tumor incidence of rats fed AIN-93G diet, while others have demonstrated SPI inhibition of rat hepatic ME1 expression. The present study examined the individual and combined effects of dietary SPI and absence of ME1 on: 1) serum concentrations of hormones implicated in colon cancer development, 2) expression of lipogenic and proliferation-associated genes in the mouse colon and small intestine, and 3) liver and adipose expression of lipogenic and adipocytokine genes that may contribute to colon cancer predisposition. Methods: Weanling wild type (WT) and ME1 null (MOD-1) male mice were fed high-fat (HF), iso-caloric diets containing either casein (CAS) or SPI as sole protein source for 5 wks. Somatic growth, serum hormone and glucose levels, liver and adipose tissue weights, GI tissue parameters, and gene expression were evaluated. Results: The MOD-1 genotype and SPI-HF diet resulted in decreases in: body and retroperitoneal fat weights, serum insulin, serum leptin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, adipocyte size, colon mTOR and cyclin D1 mRNA abundance, and jejunum FASN mRNA abundance, when compared to WT mice fed CAS-HF. Regardless of diet, MOD-1 mice had reductions in liver weight, liver steatosis, and colon crypt depth, and increases in adipose tissue expression of IRS1 and IRS2, compared to WT mice. SPI-HF diet reduced ME1 gene expression only in retroperitoneal fat. Conclusions: Data suggest that the pharmacological targeting of ME1 or the inclusion of soy protein in the diet may provide avenues to reduce obesity and its associated pro-tumorigenic endocrine environment and improve insulin sensitivity, potentially disrupting the obesity-colon cancer connection. 2012 Al-Dwairi et al.",NA,"adipocyte adipose tissue animal experiment animal tissue article body fat body growth caloric intake cancer risk cancer susceptibility cell size colon *colon cancer controlled study fatty liver gene expression genotype insulin blood level intestine crypt lipid diet liver weight male mouse nonhuman *obesity protein expression *protein intake retroperitoneal fat risk reduction weight reduction wild type adiponectin/ec [Endogenous Compound] casein cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] fatty acid synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound] glucose/ec [Endogenous Compound] insulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] insulin receptor substrate 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] insulin receptor substrate 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] leptin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)/ec [Endogenous Compound] mammalian target of rapamycin/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] soybean protein",NA,"7","2012",-1

Su","Prioritizing cancer therapeutic small molecules by integrating multiple OMICS datasets","Drug design is crucial for the effective discovery of anti-cancer drugs. The success or failure of drug design often depends on the leading compounds screened in pre-clinical studies. Many efforts, such as in vivo animal experiments and in vitro drug screening, have improved this process, but these methods are usually expensive and laborious. In the post-genomics era, it is possible to seek leading compounds for large-scale candidate small-molecule screening with multiple OMICS datasets. In the present study, we developed a computational method of prioritizing small molecules as leading compounds by integrating transcriptomics and toxicogenomics data. This method provides priority lists for the selection of leading compounds, thereby reducing the time required for drug design. We found 11 known therapeutic small molecules for breast cancer in the top 100 candidates in our list, 2 of which were in the top 10. Furthermore, another 3 of the top 10 small molecules were recorded as closely related to cancer treatment in the DrugBank database. A comparison of the results of our approach with permutation tests and shared gene methods demonstrated that our OMICS data-based method is quite competitive. In addition, we applied our method to a prostate cancer dataset. The results of this analysis indicated that our method surpasses both the shared gene method and random selection. These analyses suggest that our method may be a valuable tool for directing experimental studies in cancer drug design, and we believe this time- and cost-effective computational strategy will be helpful in future studies in cancer therapy.

Because mother's milk is the sole source of nutrition for newborns when bacteria first colonize the gut and establish mutualistic microbial biofilms, milk is expected to contain components which help the microbial flora become established. In the present study, the intercellular association of E. coli by human whey was evaluated in vitro alongside that by purified secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA, a microbial agglutinin found in human milk), by infant formulas, and by bovine whey. Human whey, unlike SIgA, mediated bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation independently of the type 1 pilus. Further, human whey mediated bacterial aggregation over a broader range of bacterial concentrations than did SIgA, affecting the aggregation of bacteria at concentrations 1000-fold less than could be mediated by SIgA. These findings indicate that human whey utilizes multiple mechanisms to facilitate bacterial association. In contrast, infant formulas and bovine whey mediated planktonic bacterial growth but not apparent intercellular bacterial association, regardless of the expression of the type 1 pilus. These studies provide insight into how human milk might protect against infections and illnesses, and also provide a possible approach by which infant formulas may be developed and tested to more accurately mimic interactions of human milk with enteric flora, potentially improving the efficacy and health benefits of those formulas. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"agglutination test article artificial milk bacterial cell *bacterial growth bacterial strain bacterium pilus biofilm breast milk cell aggregation colony forming unit colostrum concentration response controlled study cow Escherichia coli K 12 female human *human whey *infant nutrition intestine flora molecular weight nonhuman *plankton priority journal protection soybean milk symbiosis temperature *whey secretory immunoglobulin","168-176","8","2012",-1

Chamberlain","Menopausal symptoms in young survivors of breast cancer: A growing problem without an ideal solution","Background: New breast cancers occur in 25% to 30% of women < 50 years of age. These young women undergo ablative surgery, chemotherapy, or hormonal/targeted treatment. These treatments have resulted in increased survival but at the expense of early menopause, marked by distressing vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, decreased metabolism, and musculoskeletal and cardiovascular effects. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed. This article reviews the evidencebased approaches to the treatment of these distressing symptoms in young breast cancer survivors. Results: Menopausal symptoms in young patients are typically more severe due to the abrupt and rapid decrease in estrogen, and chemotherapy and hormones worsen these symptoms. Evidence supporting the effi cacy of most complementary therapies is scarce. Behavioral modifi cation and yoga may be helpful in mild cases of vasomotor symptoms, whereas newer antidepressants are promising in moderate to severe cases, and stellate ganglion block may be used in refractory cases. Local vaginal moisturizers, and in refractory cases low-dose estrogen creams, may ameliorate most urogenital symptoms. Bisphosphonates, vitamin D, and calcium can treat osteoporosis, and weight-bearing exercises decrease bone mineral density loss and help to control weight. Smoking cessation, exercise, and dietary modifi cations should be recommended to all young patients to decrease cardiac morbidity. At present, there is insuffi cient evidence to support any natural agent as a viable alternative to hormone replacement therapy to treat these symptoms. Conclusions: No single agent can ameliorate vasomotor, cardiac, skeletal, and sexual concerns of young breast cancer survivors coping with menopausal symptoms. Quality-of-life research involving premenopausal breast cancer survivors is lacking.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was considered as the first-line treatment for vasomotor symptoms but, consumption of these products may have gastrointestinal side effects, hirsutism, weight gain and vaginal bleeding. Also, they increase the risk of endometrial, breast and ovary cancers in long term use. Despite the fact that there is limited scientific evidence describing efficacy and long-term safety of herbal products, many women use them to relief menopausal symptoms. Methods: This paper reviews the effect of Phytoestrogens commonly used in menopause such as trigonella foenum-graecum on hot flash. We searched the MEDLINE database from 2000 to September 2011 about the effect of herbal supplementation on relief of hot flash. Consult & conclusion: The evidence to date suggests that trigonella foenum-graecum is safe and effective for reducing hot flash. It can reduce the number and strength of the vasomotor symptoms. Other Phytoestrogens extracts, including soy foods and red clover have a positive effect on menopausal symptoms as hot flash but their efficiency is minimal, whereas they have positive health effects on plasma lipid concentrations and may reduce heart disease.

Menopause, furthermore, accelerates bone loss. Estrogen Progesterone Therapy (EPT) is a classical treatment for climacteric syndrome, but contraindications have limited its use. Objective: DT56a is a unique enzymatic isolate of soybeans. Studies have shown that it acts as a phyto- SERM, displaying beneficial estrogenic effects on selected tissues such as bone and functioning as antagonist in others. The purpose of our study was to estimate the efficacy and safety of DT56a, compared to EPT. Method: 53 perimenopausal women with climacteric symptoms were randomly assigned to receive either DT56a or estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT). 36 symptomatic women not wishing to receive any treatment served as controls. The following parameters were assessed at baseline and at 12 months: TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, Lpa, ApoA1, ApoB, bone markers, endometrial thickness, mammography and bone mineral density (BMD). Menopausal symptoms were assessed by Kupperman index. Results: Both treatment arms significantly improved menopausal symptoms, p-value <0.001. Adjusting for initial values and for years since menopause lead to a significant improvement in the EPT arm and a borderline improvement in the phyto-SERM arm (no treatment vs. HT p-value <0.001 and no treatment vs. phyto-SERMs p-value 0.091). BMD remained stable in both arms, while it decreased in the control group. No differences in endometrial thickness or in the mammography were detected in any of the treatment arms.

However, despite of several studies performed with phytoestrogens, the risks and benefits of these compounds are not yet well established. The main objective of this work was to investigate the effects of estrogen and phytoestrogens on the proliferation and motility behavior of two breast cancer cell lines (the estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 and the estrogen receptor negative MDA-MB-231), compared with a non-tumorigenic breast cell line (MCF-12A). Cells were incubated in either regular or phenol red-free charcoal-stripped culture media. Results obtained from our study showed that, when cultured in phenol red-free media supplemented with charcoal stripped serum (FBS), all cell lines present lower proliferation rates and decreased motility, compared to regular medium controls, evaluated by the fluorescent phagokinetic assay. Furthermore, in the presence of Enterolactone and Enterodiol, MCF-7 cell proliferation (100nM - 10muM) was decreased. In contrast with 17-beta estradiol (E2), Enterodiol (100nM-10muM) does not increase cell proliferation in MCF-12A cells. Although more studies are clearly needed, the data suggest that both enterodiol and enterolactone appear to have a different impact in terms of motility and proliferation of breast tumor and non-tumor cells, which warrants a closer look on these compounds as safer alternatives for HRT.",NA,"*breast cell *cell proliferation *menopause *andropause cell line hormone substitution tumor cell breast tumor cancer cell culture human cell strain MCF 7 breast cancer assay serum culture medium risk female *estrogen *phytoestrogen enterodiol charcoal enterolactone estradiol estrogen receptor phenolsulfonphthalein","S32","71","2012",-1

Since 2002, Britain, the US and Europe's medicines and health care products regulatory agency have advised that women taking HRT should do so for as little time as possible on the lowest dose. With growing concerns of the detrimental effects of HRT, alternative treatments have been sought. The use of natural resources to reduce menopausal symptoms whilst avoiding the risks of HRT has incurred an increase in attention. Although the use of natural supplements to relieve physical symptoms has received much consideration, the effects on cognitive deficits experienced during the transition are fairly under-assessed. HRT has its greatest cognitive benefits when initiated close to the onset of the individuals' menopausal symptoms. Should this be considered when initiating natural supplements? The current study considers the action of isoflavones on working memory and sustained attention during different stages of the menopause. Women enter the study as peri-menopausal or post-menopausal according to their last menstrual bleed. The women are then randomly assigned to either a placebo or experimental (100mg isoflavones daily) intervention to which a tablet is received daily for a three month period.

There are three major classes of phytoestrogens: the isoflavones, lignans and coumestans. Numerous systematic reviews have analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of phytoestrogens in relieving vasomotor menopausal symptoms, in reducing the incidence of breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and in preventing the loss of bone mineral density in menopausal women. Until now no conclusive evidence has emerged (1). Recent systematic reviews conclude that phytoestrogens should only be used in women with mild to moderate vasomotor symptoms in early natural menopause (1). A recent meta-analysis of 17 RCTs of soy isoflasvones on bone mineral density showed that isoflavones are not effective in decreasing bone loss in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women (2). By contrast, another meta-analysis found a reduction of the loss of bone mineral density and a slight decrease in LDL cholesterol in postmenopausal women taking soy isoflavones (1). Three RCTs out of four RCTs found that flaxseed was not more effective than placebo for reducing hot flashes (1). Contradictory and inconclusive results exist on the efficacy of flaxseed in reducing cholesterol concentration in menopausal women. Results from clinical trials did not show that phytoestrogens cause breast cancer-promoting effects in healthy women or breast cancer survivors. Moreover, a meta-analysis of observational epidemiological studies suggested a decreased risk of breast cancer in women consuming phytoestrogens.",NA,"*menopause *human *female *andropause breast cancer meta analysis bone density postmenopause systematic review (topic) linseed therapy osteolysis cardiovascular disease plant risk cancer survivor clinical trial (topic) hot flush *phytoestrogen isoflavone derivative low density lipoprotein cholesterol lignan cholesterol placebo low density lipoprotein","S13-S14","71","2012",-1

Chang","Human breast cancer stem cells have significantly higher rate of clathrin-independent and caveolin-independent endocytosis than the differentiated breast cancer cells","Breast Cancer Stem (BCS) cells play critical roles in self-renewal, Multi Drug Resistance (MDR), differentiation and generation of secondary tumors. Conventional chemotherapy may efficiently kill the bulk of differentiated drug sensitive breast cancer cells, but not the MDR self-renewable BCS cells, leading to enrichment of the MDR BCS cells. In order to target the MDR BCS cells, we have isolated: 1) BCS cells from either breast cancer cell lines or fresh breast cancer specimens; 2) ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter group G number 2 (ABCG2)-specific aptamers; and 3) BCS cell-binding aptamers. Interestingly, ABCG2-specific aptamers labeled the membrane surface of the ABCG2-expressing baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, but stained whole cells of the BCS cells derived from mammospheres, implying that BCS cells might have much higher rate of endocytosis than the ABCG2-expressing BHK cells. In addition, 5D3, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the extracellular loops of ABCG2 protein, also stained whole BCS cells. Furthermore, BCS cell-binding aptamers stained whole BCS cells, but not the differentiated breast cancer MCF-7 cells. All these results support above conclusion that BCS cells might have high rate of endocytosis. Further experiments performed with aptamers and human transferrin or lactosylceramide showed that BCS cells do have much higher endocytosis rate than the differentiated breast cancer cells. Interestingly, clathrin dependent endocytosis inhibitors, such as monodansylcadaverine or sucrose, or caveolin-dependent endocytosis inhibitors, such as methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or genistein, can inhibit the internalization of transferrin or lactosylceramide into the differentiated breast cancer cells, but cannot block the internalization of these compounds into the BCS cells, suggesting that BCS cells undergo clathrin-independent and caveolin-independent endocytosis. Taken together, our data suggest that BCS cells have high rate of endocytosis and open the possibilities for delivering therapeutic agents directly into the MDR BCS cells with aptamer-coated liposomes. 2012 Palaniyandi K, et al.",NA,"animal cell article *breast cancer *cancer stem cell cell differentiation cell labeling cell renewal cell strain BHK cell strain MCF 7 endocytosis human human cell human tissue internalization multidrug resistance nonhuman tumor differentiation aptamer breast cancer resistance protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *caveolin *clathrin dansylcadaverine genistein lactosylceramide methyl beta cyclodextrin sucrose transferrin","214-222","4","2012",-1

Existing preventive strategies generally involve mole screening followed by surgical removal of the benign nevi and abnormal moles. However, due to lack of effective programs for screening and disease recurrence after surgical resection, there is a need for better chemopreventive agents. Although sunscreens have been used extensively for protecting from UV-induced melanomas, results of correlative population-based studies are controversial, with certain studies suggest increased skin cancer risk in sunscreen users. Therefore, these studies require further authentication to conclusively confirm the chemoprotective efficacy of sunscreens.

During the brewing process, hop is used to add bitterness to the beer which makes this drink the main dietary source of Xn. As a phytoestrogen, Xn binds and activates both estrogen receptor subtypes, ERalpha and ERbeta, although it has 3-fold higher affinity for the former. Estrogenic compounds are of great interest since they are known to promote cell growth and oxidative stress in several hormonedependent cancers. In this work we have used the estrogendependent breast cancer cell line MCF7 which presents both ERalpha and ERbeta. Our aim was to study the effects of Xn on MCF7 cell proliferation and oxidative stress. To tackle this aim we measured Xn citotoxicity, cellular ROS production, levels of oxidative damage markers and antioxidant enzyme activities and levels. Results showed that Xn has a biphasic effect on cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with low concentrations inducing cell proliferation whereas high concentrations inhibit cell growth. Regarding oxidative stress, Xn high concentrations induce an increase in ROS levels. This increase of oxidative stress is consistent with a decrease in some antioxidant systems (e.g. catalase and Cu/Zn-SOD). This preliminary work suggest that Xn may modulate cell proliferation and oxidative stress in breast cancer cells and, therefore, this compound may be of interest for the development of new drugs in the pharmaceutical setting. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to reach to know the action mechanism of Xn.",NA,"*hops *beer *modulation *breast cancer *cancer cell culture oxidative stress cell proliferation cell growth Humulus lupulus bitter taste inflorescence female cancer cell brewing humus estrogen activity neoplasm enzyme activity *xanthohumol *flavonoid antioxidant estrogen receptor phytoestrogen receptor subtype marker catalase new drug","217","279","2012",-1

Studies in rodent brains have revealed that ERalpha is the predominant ER in the hypothalamus and controls reproduction. ERbeta influences on non-reproductive processes and appears to be the main ER subtype expressed in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum and the dorsal raphe. During embryogenesis, estrogen plays an important role in brain development regulating maturation of distinct brain structures, thereby contributing to modulation of the function of these structures. Studies on the brains of ERbeta knockout mice revealed that, during embryonic brain development, ERbeta affects cortical layering and interneuron migration, thus playing a key role in brain morphogenesis.

Van Den Berg","Genistein induces breast cancer-associated aromatase and stimulates estrogen-dependent tumor cell growth in in vitro breast cancer model","Aromatase (cytochrome P450 19, CYP19) catalyzes the conversion of androgens into estrogens. Especially in post-menopausal women, estrogen production in breast tissue by CYP19 becomes a major site of hormone production. In healthy BAFs, CYP19 expression is low and is mainly driven by promoter I.4. In fibroblasts surrounding a tumor, a promoter switch to PI.3/II takes place and CYP19 expression is elevated 3-4-fold (Agarwal et al., 1996). This makes this enzyme an important target for estrogen-dependent breast cancer treatment by aromatase inhibitors, such as letrozole (LET). Breast cancer treatment often results in sudden onset of menopausal symptoms and many women seek for alternative therapies to treat these symptoms. A commonly used treatment is the soy-isoflavone genistein (GEN). In this study, the potential interaction between LET and GEN on CYP19 and possible effects on tumor cell growth were studied. In healthy primary human BAFs, PI.4-driven CYP19 expression was increased 45-fold by its stimulant dexamethasone. Expression of PI.3/II-driven aromatase was low in BAFs and only increased 7-fold by the stimulant PGE2. GEN did not affect CYP19 expression in BAFs. In contrast, in human adrenocorticocarcinoma H295R cells, that express PI.3/II-driven CYP19, GEN concentration-dependently induced aromatase activity (EC50 = 26-M) and expression. LET inhibited CYP19 activity in H295R cells with an IC50 value of 0.2-M. Coincubation with GEN resulted in a concentration-dependent negation of CYP19 inhibition by LET through increased CYP19 expression. This interaction did not affect the EC50 of GEN, nor did it alter the IC50 of LET. In breast cancer, the interaction between estrogen-producing breast adipose fibroblasts (BAFs) and estrogen-dependent epithelial tumor cells is pivotal. In our lab, we have previously developed an in vitro breast cancer model where the positive feedback loop between primary human BAFs and estrogen-dependent MCF-7 tumor cells is operational, thereby representing a more natural in vitro model for breast cancer (Heneweer et al., 2005). In this model, GEN could still induce MCF-7 cell proliferation as shown by increased gene expression of estrogen-dependent pS2. Coexposure to GEN and LET, did not significantly affect pS2 gene expression, suggesting a predominant ER-mediated action of GEN in this model. However, in a co-culture model with MCF-7 cells and H295R cells, thus expressing the breast cancer-associated PI.3/IIdriven CYP19, induction of pS2 gene expression by GEN was lower when co-exposed with LET. Yet, LET did not fully counteract the induction by GEN. Furthermore, gene expression and activity of CYP19 was still higher in the H295R/MCF-7 co-culture upon coexposure to GEN and LET than in vehicle control-treated cells. These data indicate that the actions of GEN on CYP19 appear to be restricted to PI.3/II-driven CYP19 that can be found in BAFs surrounding a tumor. Furthermore, at physiologically relevant concentrations GEN could overcome the inhibitory actions on tumor cell growth by LET. Considering the high number of breast cancer patients using soy supplements to treat menopausal symptoms, the increasing risk for adverse interactions with breast cancer treatment is of major concern. Therefore, the use of GEN by women undergoing breast cancer treatment with LET should be considered with care.",NA,"*breast cancer *toxicology *tumor growth *in vitro study *cancer model *society human model cancer therapy gene expression female breast coculture tumor cell strain MCF 7 tumor cell fibroblast promoter region estrogen synthesis alternative medicine menopause epithelium tumor cancer patient hormone synthesis cell proliferation feedback system positive feedback risk *genistein *estrogen *aromatase central stimulant agent prostaglandin E2 dexamethasone isoflavone letrozole aromatase inhibitor enzyme androgen cytochrome P450 cytochrome","43-44","290","2011",-1
"635","542"," L. Aleksunes","Interaction of the placental BCRP transporter with environmental chemicals","Objectives: Over the last decade, the scientific community has voiced increasing concern regarding disruption of endocrine and reproductive systems as a consequence of in utero exposure to xenobiotics. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are quite diverse and include plasticizers, mycotoxins, phytoestrogens, and pesticides. The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is a chemical efflux transporter expressed in the human placenta that is responsible for fetal-to-maternal transport. Inhibition of the fetoprotective function of BCRP may be a mechanism involved in the susceptibility of the developing fetus to toxicities following EDC exposure. The purpose of this study was to characterize EDCs as potential substrates and inhibitors of the BCRP transporter. Methods: Two in vitro screening assays, the BCRP ATPase assay and inverted membrane vesicle assay, were used to test interactions between BCRP and twelve chemicals with potential for endocrine disruption: bisphenol A, genistein, methoxychlor, prochloraz, zearalenone, tebuconazole, propiconazole, tributyltin, zeranol, myclobutanil, propargite and epoxiconazole. Results: Based on the ATPase assay, it was confirmed that genistein is a substrate for BCRP, while slight increases in ATP hydrolysis were observed for tributyltin, zeranol, zearalenone, and bisphenol A, indicating they may be possible substrates. In both assays, all twelve EDCs inhibited BCRP transport of known substrates (sulfasalazine and lucifer yellow). Conclusion: Genistein, tributyltin, zeranol, zearalenone and methoxychlor were some of the most potent inhibitors of BCRP transport. Cell-based studies are currently underway to further characterize the inhibitory kinetics of EDCs on BCRP-mediated transport and further characterize transport affinity. These findings may assist in risk assessment of perinatal exposure to these chemicals.",NA,"*placenta assay exposure membrane vesicle hydrolysis risk assessment genital system screening in vitro study toxicity fetus human kinetics effusion community *environmental chemical *breast cancer resistance protein zearalenone tributyltin zeranol genistein adenosine triphosphatase 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol methoxychlor plasticizer myclobutanil pesticide propiconazole phytoestrogen endocrine disruptor prochloraz xenobiotic agent tebuconazole mycotoxin salazosulfapyridine lucifer yellow adenosine triphosphate","A42","33","2012",-1

In recent years, flavonoids have been found to be beneficial to human health due to their anti-oxidant and anti-tumor activities. Our lab has investigated the ability of flavonoids to induce cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cell lines. We have discovered that some compounds can induce cytotoxicity very readily whereas others are not. We hypothesize that this difference is attributed to the compounds ability to transverse the cell membrane and enter the cytosol. Therefore, we have used HPLC-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis to quantitate the amount of flavonoids that are able to enter into MDA-MB-231 cells, a human breast cancer cell line. We tested kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, daidzein, and chrysin. MDA-MB-231 cells were plated, and treated with 100muM flavonoids for 24 and 48 hours. After treatment, cells were counted and extracted using 40% methanol. Flavonoids from extracts were characterized and quantitated by LC-MS using an Agilent QTOF6520 tandem mass spectrometer and an Agilent 1100 HPLC. Our results indicate as intracellular flavonoid concentration increase, cellular cytotoxicity also increases. We could not detect quercetin and myricetin in cell extracts. However, quercetin was found to be a moderate inducer of cytoxicity. We find that quercetin dimerizes over time in cell medium only in the presence of serum suggesting an enzymatic mechanism.

Therefore we aimed to verify potentially their anti-androgenic activities in vivo by the comparative assessment of the activities of naringenin, 6-(1,1-dimethylallyl)naringenin (6-DMAN) and 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN). Methodologically we performed an (Anti-)Hershberger assay in orchiectomized animals. Control animals were carrier treated, all other animals were substituted with dihydrotestosterone (0,25 mg/kg KGW/d) alone or in combination with the antiandrogens flutamide or bicalutamide (3 mg/kg KGW/d), the three phytoestrogens (15 mg/kg KGW/d) or estradiol (10 mug/kg KGW/d). After seven day treatment the wet weight of the seminal vesicles and prostate was estimated. As expected, dihydrotestosterone increased accessory sex organ wet weights statistically. Flutamide and or bicalutamide significantly inhibited the dihydrotestosterone induced re-growth of seminal vesicles and ventral prostate. The phytoestrogens and estradiol also inhibited the re-growth of ventral prostate, but not to the same extent as the antiandrogens. In contrast the re-growth of seminal vesicles was only inhibited by 6-DMAN, but not by 8-PN, naringenin or estradiol. To further elucidate the potential antiandrogenic effects on a mechanistic level, we assessed expression patterns of selected genes in the accessory sex organs on the mRNA and protein level. In seminal vesicles and ventral prostate we analysed the mRNA levels of the estrogen receptors alpha and beta, androgen receptor, clusterin and ornithin decarboxylase 1. Protein expression levels were assessed for prostate specific antigen, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the androgen receptor. The molecular studies to large extend confirmed physiological findings on antiandrogenic properties of the tested naringenins. In summary, for the first time we provide evidence of the anti-androgenic activity of naringenin type phytoestrogens in vivo on the level of accessory sex organ weight, gene and protein expression.

In IDD, ISD and pISD onset of puberty, the menstrual cycle length andproliferative status of the mammary gland at day 50 were determined. The onset of puberty occurred significant earlier in pISD and ISD compared to IDD. Menstrual cycle length was significantly shortened in pISD. In intact animals at day 50 and day 80 the uterus wet weights were not affected by the respective diets. Proliferation in the mammary gland was not affected by IDD and ISD.To analyze the effect of ISO on the estrogen sensitivity of mammary gland, animals of all groups were ovariectomised at the age of 80 days. At the age of 94 days animals were treated for 3 days with estradiol. Interestingly proliferative response of the mammary gland towards E2 was significantly reduced in the pISD and ISD groups. In contrast a reduced response of progesterone receptor (PR) expression towards E2 could be only observed in the ISD group. In the IRD 400 group visceral fat tissue mass was significantly reduced by E2 treatment compared to the respective control group.In summary our results provide evidence that in female rats the exposure to ISO during puberty reduces the proliferative response to E2. In contrast regulation of PR expression by E2 is only affected following lifelong ISO exposure. Our preliminary data from fat tissue suggest that in addition other tissues than the mammary gland differentially responds to estrogens following dietary exposure to ISO. We hypothesize that the estrogen sensitivity of different endpoints relevant to critical periods of development are modulated by ISO. Investigation of the involved molecular mechanism is in progress.",NA,"*exposure *mammary gland *adipose tissue *society diet puberty rat menstrual cycle Asia adult animal breast cancer female intraabdominal fat uterus weight Asian tissues *isoflavone estrogen daidzein genistein isoflavone derivative estradiol progesterone receptor glycitein",NA,"33","2012",1

Simmen","Loss of cytosolic Malic Enzyme (ME1) in mice confers an endocrine profile favoring decreased risk of obesity-associated colon cancers","Obesity and its associated hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia are known risk factors for colon cancer. Cytosolic Malic Enzyme (ME1) generates NADPH for lipogenesis in liver and fat tissues, and is a major obesity and diabetes-associated gene. Soy protein based diets reduce ME1 gene expression in liver and fat; lower body fat content; and attenuate colon tumor incidence in rodent models. To evaluate the role of ME1 and its regulation by diet on endocrine and metabolic parameters implicated in obesity-associated colon cancers, we examined the effect of soy protein isolate (SPI)-supplemented diet on weight gain, hormonal status, and mRNA expression of lipogenic enzymes [ME1, Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN)] and proliferation-associated proteins (Ki-67, mTOR) in colons and small intestines of wild type (WT) and ME1 null (MOD-1 line) mice. Male WT and MOD-1 mice were weaned to a high fat (HF) diet containing casein (CAS-HF, control diet) or SPI (SPI-HF). Diets were fed for 5 wks. The SPI-HF-fed WT mice had a significant reduction in weight gain compared to the WT mice fed with CAS-HF (33.2 + 0.79 vs. 29.3 + 0.7 g, P<0.001), whereas MOD-1 mice on both diets gained less weight (23.7 + 0.61 g) than corresponding WT mice (P<0.001). MOD-1 mice fed either diet had ~20% reduction in liver weight, ~50% reduction in gonadal and retroperitoneal fat weights (P<0.01), and reduction in colon crypt depth (177 + 9.28 vs. 141.3 + 8.5 mum, P<0.01), compared to WT mice fed CAS-HF diet. SPI-HF-fed WT mice and MOD-1 mice fed either diet had 50-70% reductions in serum insulin and leptin levels (P<0.001), ~50% reductions in colon mTOR and jejunum Ki-67 gene expression (P<0.01), and ~25% reduction in jejunum FASN mRNA transcripts (P<0.05), compared to CAS-HF-fed WT counterparts. However, colon and jejunum ME1 gene expression was unaffected by diet. SPI-HF diet increased serum adiponectin levels in WT mice. The leptin/adiponectin ratio was reduced by ~45% in SPI-HF-fed WT mice, and by ~75% in MOD-1 mice (both diets), when compared to WT mice fed CAS-HF (P<0.001). Sera from MOD-1 mice decreased proliferation of HCT-116 human colon cancer cells, when compared to sera from WT mice (P<0.05).

Katzenellenbogen","Botanical estrogens: Molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways of activity in target cells","Botanical estrogens (BEs) are widely consumed by women with the expectation that they provide a safe, natural source of estrogens to replace the loss of endogenous estrogen in the menopause. Because estrogens can have diverse effects in target cells, including the stimulation of some breast cancers, this unregulated consumption of BEs might not contribute uniformly to healthy aging. Estrogens regulate gene transcriptional programs and the physiology of many reproductive and non-reproductive tissues, and the mechanisms by which they act are multi-faceted, involving two estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta, and nuclear-initiated and extranuclear-initiated pathways. With BEs, little is known about these mechanistic and cellular aspects. We are using a systems biology approach to provide a molecular and cellular profile of the activity of BEs, to enable determination of whether they have activities similar to or distinct from estradiol. We have examined molecular interactions of BEs with ERalpha and ERbeta: ligand binding, conformation and dynamics of the ligand-receptor complexes, and interaction with key coregulators. We are also investigating on a genome-wide basis, how the patterns of ER and coregulator recruitment to chromatin binding sites (cistromes) and changes in gene expression (transcriptomes) in target cells are regulated by BEs through nuclear and extranuclear pathways; and we are developing mechanistic systems biology profiles that relate the cistromes, transcriptomes, and pathway-specific actions of BEs to their effects on cell functional properties. In general, we have found that BEs show preference in binding and coactivator recruitment to ERbeta compared to ERalpha. The relative levels of ERalpha and ERbeta in cells therefore greatly impact gene expression and proliferation response to different BEs. Among the BEs tested, potency and efficacy of liquiritigenin and S-equol through ERbeta were greater than expected from their ERbeta binding affinities. ERbeta dampened the pro-proliferative activity of estrogens through ERalpha, and BEs varied in their effectiveness in suppressing proliferation through ERbeta. Based on these molecular and cellular profiles, we are able to place cell response to BEs on a mechanistic basis that will allow determination of whether BEs have similar or unique activities compared to those of other estrogens and provide fundamental information to inform future clinical studies.",NA,"*target cell *society systems biology human gene expression aging dynamics ligand binding gene breast cancer stimulation clinical study molecular interaction menopause genome chromatin tissues binding site physiology binding affinity female *estrogen transcriptome receptor estradiol equol ligand liquiritigenin estrogen receptor",NA,"33","2012",-1

Previously, we established an in vitro assay for TPO activity based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into human follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC-238) cells. It is important to determine whether environmental chemicals can disrupt TPO activity because it is an important factor in the TH axis. In this study, we used our assay to examine the changes in TPO activity in response to various chemicals, including benzophenones (BPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Overall, BPs, PAHs, and POPs slightly altered TPO activity at low doses, as compared with the positive controls methimazole (MMI), genistein, and 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxy BP. Benzophenone, benzhydrol, 3-methylchloranthracene, pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(e)pyrene, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and heptachlor decreased TPO activity, while 2,4-dihydroxy BP, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy BP, and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene increased TPO activity. From these data, we can predict the disruption of TPO activity by various chemicals as a sensitive TH end point.

RSV inhibits tumor cell growth in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer cell lines resulting in cell specific regulation of the G1/S and G2/M stages of the cell cycle. However apoptotic cell death was only observed in ER+ MCF-7 cells. In this study, we designed and synthesized boronic acid derivative of RSV and evaluated their biological effects on ER + MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The trans-4 analog inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells and is not a substrate for p-glycoprotein. The trans-4 analog induces G1 cell cycle arrest, which coincides with marked inhibition of G1 cell cycle proteins and a greater pro-apoptotic effect. Finally, the trans-4 analog had no effect on the estrogen-stimulated growth of MCF-7 cells. Our results demonstrate that the trans-4 analog inhibits MCF-7 breast cancer cells by a different mechanism of action than that of RSV (S-phase arrest), and provides a new class of novel boronic acids of RSV that inhibit breast cancer cell growth. 2012 Landes Bioscience.",NA,"*antiproliferative activity apoptosis article cancer growth *cancer inhibition cell lysate cell strain MCF 7 controlled study drug design drug structure drug synthesis *estrogen receptor positive breast cancer G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint human human cell multidrug resistance *2[4 (3,5 dimethyoxystyryl)phenyl] 4,4,5,5 tetramethyl 1,3,2 dioxaborolane/dv [Drug Development] *2[4 (3,5 dimethyoxystyryl)phenyl] 4,4,5,5 tetramethyl 1,3,2 dioxaborolane/pd [Pharmacology] *4 (3,5 dihydroxystyryl)phenylboronic acid/dv [Drug Development] *4 (3,5 dihydroxystyryl)phenylboronic acid/pd [Pharmacology] *antineoplastic agent/dv [Drug Development] *antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] *boronic acid derivative/dv [Drug Development] *boronic acid derivative/pd [Pharmacology] paclitaxel *resveratrol/dv [Drug Development] *resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","925-934","13","2012",-1

The two hydroxydaidzeins reduced melanin synthesis comparably to treatment with kojic acid, proven whitening agent, in B16 melanom cells. Furthermore, when in vitro human skin equivalents were treated with the hydroxydaidzeins, the levels of melanogenesis were significantly reduced relative to kojic acid control. The RT-PCR results demonstrated that depigmentation was due to transcriptional repression of several melanogenesis genes, including microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), by the hydroxydaidzeins. The immunoblotting results confirmed that diminution of MITF expression subsequently decreased expression of tyrosinase, and tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2. Cumulatively, these results suggest that hydroxydaidzeins would be potent attenuators of melanin synthesis as well as effective inhibitors of hyperpigmentation in human skin.

However, there are no reports on the curative effects of Formo. The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of Formo in restoring trabecular microarchitecture and promoting new bone formation in osteopenic rats. METHODS: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized and left for 90 days for osteopenia to develop. After 90 days, Formo (10.0 mg kg d) was given orally for the next 12 weeks to Ovx rats in a therapeutic protocol. Sham-operated, Ovx + vehicle, and Ovx + parathyroid hormone (PTH) groups served as controls. Trabecular microarchitecture, osteoid formation, bone turnover/resorption markers, and bone osteoprotegerin-to-receptor activator for nuclear B ligand ratio were studied. One-way analysis of variance was used to test significance of effects. RESULTS: Formo treatment significantly restored the lost trabecular microarchitecture in the femurs and tibia of osteopenic Ovx rats and promoted new bone formation. Formo was devoid of any uterine estrogenicity. Serum levels of type I collagen N-terminal propeptide, which is a reliable marker of bone formation, were increased in Ovx rats treated with Formo compared with Ovx + vehicle group, and the levels were comparable with those in the sham group. Formo prevented the Ovx-induced increase in bone turnover markers, including serum osteocalcin and urinary type I collagen degradation product. Furthermore, Formo-treated Ovx rats had an increased bone osteoprotegerin-to-receptor activator for nuclear B ligand ratio compared with the Ovx + vehicle group. CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral administration of Formo for 12 weeks has a substantial anabolic effect, thus raising the possibility of its use in postmenopausal osteoporosis. 2012 by The North American Menopause Society.",NA,"analysis of variance animal experiment animal model animal tissue article bone structure bone turnover collagen degradation controlled study female femur nonhuman nucleotide sequence ossification osteoid osteolysis *osteopenia/dt [Drug Therapy] *ovariectomy postmenopause osteoporosis protein blood level protein urine level rat sham procedure Sprague Dawley rat statistical significance tibia trabecular bone amino terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] *formononetin/an [Drug Analysis] *formononetin/dv [Drug Development] *formononetin/dt [Drug Therapy] *formononetin/po [Oral Drug Administration] *formononetin/pd [Pharmacology] gum arabic osteocalcin/ec [Endogenous Compound] osteoclast differentiation factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] parathyroid hormone/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]","856-863","19","2012",1

Constantinou","Investigation of the apoptotic pathways activated by equol and tamoxifen in MCF-7 breast cancer cells","Background: Soy phytoestrogens, such as daidzein and its metabolite equol, have been proposed to be responsible for the low breast cancer rate in Asian women. However, since these compounds possess both estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties, it remains unknown whether they provide protection against tumor development and progression. Since the majority of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are treated with the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, the basic objective of this project is to determine whether equol enhances or inhibits tamoxifen's anti-tumor effect and to identify the molecular mechanisms involved. For this purpose, we examined the individual and combined effects of equol and tamoxifen on the ER+ breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Materials and Methods: In order to examine the effects of equol and tamoxifen on the MCF-7 cells, we used viability assays (MTT assay), cell cycle analysis, annexin-V/PI staining, cell death ELISA, and western blot analysis to determine the expression of various pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. Results: We found that equol at concentrations higher than 10 mM significantly reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the combination of equol (100 mM) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (10 mM, 4OHT) reduced MCF-7 cell viability and induced apoptosis more effectively than each compound alone. Subsequent treatment of MCF-7 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK demonstrated that equol and 4-OHT induce apoptosis predominantly via caspase-depended mechanisms. In order to further investigate the apoptotic pathways employed by equol, 4-OHT and their combination, we evaluated the expression of key pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins such as PARP, alpha-fodrin, AIF, bcl-2, bax, p21 and p53 using Western blot analysis. The combination of 4-OHT and equol induced PARP and a-fodrin cleavage which was inhibited by Z-VAD-FMK indicating that their combination induces caspase-depended apoptosis. This was accompanied by reduced bcl-2:bax ratio confirming a pro-apoptotic effect. Equol and 4-OHT, individually and combined, induced caspase-9 and caspase-7 cleavage as well as cytochrome-c release to the cytoplasm, indicating activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in equol and tamoxifen induced apoptosis. Finally, upon determination of the effect of equol and tamoxifen on estrogen receptor expression in MCF-7 cells, it was found that equol inhibits 4-OHT induced increase in the ERalpha:ERbeta ratio, providing an explanation for the beneficial combined effects of equol and tamoxifen. Conclusions: In conclusion, the effects of equol in potentiating tamoxifen's anti-tumor action may be explained by the induction of the caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway and the down regulation of ERa.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease of the prostate affecting men as they age, and a risk factor for developing prostate cancer. Lycopene is a member of the carotenoid family, whose strong anti-oxidant properties have been hypothesised to assist in the prevention and treatment of BPH and prostate cancer. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of lycopene for the prevention and treatment of BPH and prostate cancer. Methods: A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) and the Cochrane Library databases was performed for published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lycopene to placebo (or other interventions) for the treatment of BPH and prostate cancer. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. Results: Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. All included studies were heterogeneous with respect to their design and implementation of lycopene. Methodological quality of three studies was assessed as posing a 'high' risk of bias, two a 'low' risk of bias and the remaining three an 'unclear' risk of bias. Meta-analysis of four studies identified no significant decrease in the incidence of BPH (RR (relative risk) = 0.95, 95%CI 0.63, 1.44) or prostate cancer diagnosis (RR = 0.92, 95%CI 0.66, 1.29) between men randomised to receive lycopene and the comparison group. Meta-analysis of two studies indicated a decrease in PSA levels in men diagnosed with prostate cancer, who received lycopene (MD (mean difference) = -1.58, 95%CI -2.61, -0.55). Conclusions: Given the limited number of RCTs published, and the varying quality of existing studies, it is not possible to support, or refute, the use of lycopene for the prevention or treatment of BPH or prostate cancer. 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction This study evaluated the effects of soy isoflavones on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women. Methods Four hundred and thirty-one women, aged 45- 65 years, orally consumed 300-mg/day isoflavones (aglycone equivalents) or a placebo for 2 years in a parallel group, randomized, double-blind, two-armstudy. Each participant also ingested 600 mg of calcium and 125 IU of vitamin D3 per day. The BMD of the lumbar spine and total proximal femur were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at baseline and every half-year thereafter. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen/creatinine, and other safety assessments were examined regularly. Results Two hundred out of 217 subjects in the isoflavone group and 199 out of 214 cases in placebo group completed the treatment. Serum concentrations of isoflavone metabolites, genistein and daidzein, of the intervention group were remarkably elevated following intake of isoflavones (p< 0.001). However, differences in the mean percentage changes of BMD throughout the treatment period were not statistically significant (lumbar spine, p=0.42; total femur, p=0.39) between the isoflavone and placebo groups, according to the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method. A significant time trend of bone loss was observed at both sites as assessed by the GEE method following repeated measurement of BMD (p<0.001). Differences in bone marker levels were not significant between the two treatment groups. Conclusion Treatment with 300-mg/day isoflavones (aglycone equivalents) failed to prevent a decline in BMD in the lumbar spine or total femur compared with the placebo group.

Jefferson","Neonatal phytoestrogen exposure causes posterior patterning and altered immune responses in the adult oviduct","The phytoestrogen genistein is found in soy products including soy-based infant formulas that are consumed by about 15% of US infants. We previously found that mice exposed neonatally to genistein under a protocol that generates serum circulating levels equivalent to that observed in human infants on soy formula are infertile in part because of abnormal preimplantation embryo development in the oviduct. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the oviductal contribution to infertility in this mouse model. Histological analysis of oviducts on day 2 of pregnancy revealed abnormal vascular development, structural disorganization in the muscle layers, and regions of excessive proliferation including pseudogland formation in the oviductal epithelium. Many epithelial cells appeared abnormally distended with intracellular lipid and mucopolysaccharide material and some regions of the lumen had excessive secretions. To identify specific genes and gene pathways responsible for these abnormalities, microarray analysis was performed. Of the >40,000 genes on the array, 1126 genes were significantly altered in the oviducts on day 2 of pregnancy. The major gene ontology categories altered were immune response, cancer, cell signaling, and development. The microarray findings were confirmed and extended by performing real time RT-PCR on oviduct samples from control and genistein-treated mice on postnatal day 5 (during the time of genistein treatment), day 22 (prior to puberty) and in adult females at 4 time points: immediately prior to ovulation, just after ovulation, and days 2 and 4 of pregnancy. In addition, some of the significantly altered genes were verified by immunohistochemical and immunoblotting analyses. We found that the histological abnormalities observed in the oviduct likely result from genistein-induced changes in expression of genes required for oviduct development during the critical developmental window of postnatal reproductive tract cellular differentiation. Furthermore, the oviduct was permanently posteriorized as indicated by altered Hoxa gene expression and upregulation of developmental transcription factors normally expressed in the adult cervix and vagina. Many of the genes upregulated on pregnancy day 2 encoded proteins important for female reproductive tract epithelial cell immune responses. Upregulated mucosal immunity during preimplantation embryo development likely explains the reduced numbers and abnormal development of preimplantation embryos that manage to survive transit through the oviduct. These findings suggest that exposure to estrogenic environmental chemicals during sensitive developmental windows can permanently impair fertility by disrupting oviductal morphology and immune function.

However, the molecular mechanism by which Gen elicits its effects on triple-negative breast cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. In our study, the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was selected to determine the action of Gen on triple-negative breast cancer cells. MTT assay, flow cytometric analysis, siRNA transfection, western blotting and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) activation-nuclear translocation assay were used to address the role of NF- B activity and the Notch-1 signaling pathway on the effects of Gen. Our study revealed that Gen elicited a dramatic effect on cell growth inhibition, in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 0, 5, 10 or 20 muM Gen induced apoptosis of 6.78, 18.98, 30.45 and 60.64%, respectively. Exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to Gen also resulted in G2/M phase accumulation of cells corresponding to 4.93, 12.54, 18.93 and 30.95%, respectively. Furthermore, our data demonstrated for the first time that Gen inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells by inhibiting NF-B activity via the Nocth-1 signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that Gen downregulated the expression of cyclin B1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, possibly mediated by NF-B activation via the Notch-1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that inhibition of NF-B activity via the Notch-1 pathway may be a novel mechanism by which Gen suppresses the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells.

"675","594"," D. F. Romagnolo, J. A. Milner","Opportunities and challenges for nutritional proteomics in cancer prevention","Knowledge gaps persist about the efficacy of cancer prevention strategies based on dietary food components. Adaptations to nutrient supply are executed through tuning of multiple protein networks that include transcription factors, histones, modifying enzymes, translation factors, membrane and nuclear receptors, and secreted proteins. However, the simultaneous quantitative and qualitative measurement of all proteins that regulate cancer processes is not practical using traditional protein methodologies. Proteomics offers an attractive opportunity to fill this knowledge gap and unravel the effects of dietary components on protein networks that impinge on cancer. The articles presented in this supplement are from talks proffered in the ""Nutrition Proteomics and Cancer Prevention"" session at the American Institute for Cancer Research Annual Research Conference on Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer held in Washington, DC on October 21 and 22, 2010. Recent advances in MS technologies suggest that studies in nutrition and cancer prevention may benefit from the adoption of proteomic tools to elucidate the impact on biological processes that govern the transition from normal to malignant phenotype; to identify protein changes that determine both positive and negative responses to food components; to assess how protein networks mediate dose-, time-, and tissue-dependent responses to food components; and, finally, for predicting responders and nonresponders. However, both the limited accessibility to proteomic technologies and research funding appear to be hampering the routine adoption of proteomic tools in nutrition and cancer prevention research. 2012 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"article bone cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] Brassicaceae breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *cancer prevention colon cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] diet human leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy] liver cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] lung cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] lymphoma/dt [Drug Therapy] malignant transformation neuroblastoma/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman nutrient supply *nutritional proteomics ovary cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] phenotype prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *proteomics quantitative analysis stomach cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] vegetable cell nucleus receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclopentenone fatty acid flavonoid/dt [Drug Therapy] garlic extract/dt [Drug Therapy] green tea extract/dt [Drug Therapy] histone/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] isothiocyanic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] membrane receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] selenium Theobroma oil/dt [Drug Therapy] transcription factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] vitamin","1360S-1369S","142","2012",-1

Bavachin was purifi ed from ethanolic extract of Psoralea corylifolia and characterized its estrogenic activity by ligand binding, reporter gene activation, and endogenous estrogen receptor (ER) target gene regulation. Bavachin showed ER ligand binding activity in competitive displacement of [3H] E2 from recombinant ER. The estrogenic activity of bavachin was characterized in a transient transfection system using ERalpha or ERbeta and estrogen-responsive luciferase plasmids in CV-1 cells with an EC50 of 320 nM and 680 nM, respectively. Bavachin increased the mRNA levels of estrogen-responsive genes such as pS2 and PR, and decreased the protein level of ERalpha by proteasomal pathway. However, bavachin failed to activate the androgen receptor in CV-1 cells transiently transfected with the corresponding receptor and hormone responsive reporter plasmid.

Women receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer are particularly prone to developing these symptoms and hot flashes in this patient population can be more challenging to manage. Although hormonal agents are the most effective treatment options, they are avoided in these patients due to concerns over increased risk of breast cancer recurrence. This issue has prompted research into many nonhormonal therapies in randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Paroxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, fluoxetine, citalopram, gabapentin, and pregabalin are among those shown to have some efficacy. There have also been several studies of nonpharmacologic therapies that have demonstrated varying levels of success. In addition, special consideration should be given to interactions of several commonly used medications with the metabolism of tamoxifen.

This study compared the efficacy of the natural S-equol supplement, SE5-OH, with isoflavones for relieving hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. Methods: An 8-week randomized, double-blind, active comparator trial with SE5-OH was conducted in postmenopausal women (aged 45-65 years), who experienced >5 hot flashes/day. Participants (n=102) were assigned to one of four treatment groups: 10 (n=24), 20 (n=27), or 40 (n=25) mg S-equol/day or soy isoflavones (n=26). Participants recorded their hot flash frequency and rated their menopause symptom severity. Results: Reductions in hot flash frequency at week 8 were similar for all treatment groups. However, based on analyses of the cumulative effect for the 8-week period, 40mg/day S-equol had a greater reduction of hot flash frequency compared to isoflavones (p=0.021). A subgroup analysis further indicated that for subjects with >8 hot flashes/day at baseline, 20 and 40mg/day S-equol were superior to isoflavones in reducing hot flash frequency (p=0.045 and p=0.001, respectively). In addition, 10 and 20mg/day S-equol improved muscle and joint pain score compared with isoflavones (p=0.003 and p=0.005, respectively). Conclusions: S-equol, 10mg/day, appears to be as effective as soy isoflavones at reducing hot flash frequency and more effective for relieving muscle and joint pain in postmenopausal women. S-equol, >20mg/day, alleviates hot flashes to a greater extent than soy isoflavones in those women who experience >8 hot flashes/day.

But their molecular mechanisms of action are still unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of apigenin on proliferation and apoptosis in HER2-expressing breast cancer cells. In our experiments, apigenin inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 vec and MCF-7 HER2 cells. This growth inhibition was accompanied with an increase of sub G0/G1 apoptotic fractions. Overexpression of HER2 did not confer resistance to apigenin in MCF-7 cells. Apigenin-induced extrinsic apoptosis pathway up-regulating the levels of cleaved caspase-8, and inducing the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, whereas apigenin did not induce apoptosis via intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway since this compound did not decrease mitochondrial membrane potential maintaining red fluorescence and did not affect the levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein. Moreover, apigenin reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 (phospho-HER2 level) in MCF-7 HER2 cells, and up-regulated the levels of p53, phospho-p53 and p21 in MCF-7 vec and MCF-7 HER2 cells. This suggests that apigenin induces apoptosis through p53-dependent pathway. Apigenin also reduced the expression of phospho-JAK1 and phospho-STAT3 and decreased STAT3-dependent luciferase reporter gene activity in MCF-7 vec and MCF-7 HER2 cells. Apigenin decreased the phosphorylation level of IBalpha in the cytosol, and abrogated the nuclear translocation of p65 within the nucleus suggesting that it blocks the activation of NFB signaling pathway in MCF-7 vec and MCF-7 HER2 cells.

Our main objective, was to identify the relationship of major dietary patterns and breast cancer. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 100 patients, 30-65 years old, with breast cancer, and 174 controls from the Shohada hospital in Tehran, were sampled. Dietary intake was measured with a food frequency questionnaire. Physical activity, demographic factors and health status were questioned. The questionnaires were completed by an interviewers. Factor analysis was used to identify major dietary patterns. The association between major dietary patterns and breast cancer risk were examined by logistic regression analysis. Result: Two dietary patterns were identified. The healthy food pattern was characterized by the consumption of vegetables, fruits, low fat dairy, legumes, olive and liquid oils, Condiments, fish, organic meat, poultry, pickles, soya, and whole grains and the unhealthy food pattern was characterized by consumption of colas, sugar, tea, coffee, potato chips, fried potatoes, salt, sweets, desserts, hydrogenated fats, nuts, commercial fruit juice, refined grains, and red and processed meat. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, women in the highest tertile of the healthy dietary pattern scores, had a 66% decreased risk of breast cancer compared to those in the lowest (OR: 0.34 CI: 0.11-1.05); the unhealthy dietary pattern significantly increased the risk of breast cancer (OR: 5.17 CI: 1.56-17.14).

Te data were extracted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria by two reviewers independently, the quality of the included studies was assessed according to the Cochrane Newcastle-Ottawa scale and GRAED profiler 3.2.2, and meta-analysis was conducted by using Stata 11.0. Results A total of 6 studies involving 6 609 patients and 79 538 controls were included. Te results of meta-analyses showed that compared with the non-intake or low intake of soy foods in Adolescence, high soy foods intake in Adolescence was associated with lower risk of breast cancer (OR=0.816, 95%CI 0.670 to 0.993); In the subgroup analysis, soy foods intake in Adolescence was more effective to prevent premenopausal (OR=0.661, 95%CI 0.550 to 0.796) rather than post-menopausal (OR=0.782, 95%CI 0.486 to 1.259) breast cancer; and the effects of soy foods intake in Adolescence were not significantly different between the eastern (OR=0.793, 95%CI 0.569 to 1.105) and western (OR=0.837, 95%CI 0.743 to 0.943) women.

Estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) is expressed in the majority of breast cancers at lower levels compared with the normal breast tissue. Objective: The effect of ERbeta on the characteristics of breast tumor cells and its prognostication for the use of ERbeta-selective therapy were investigated here for the first time. Materials and methods: ERbeta was overexpressed in ERalpha positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells by gene transfection. The proliferation, motility, and xenografts growth of MCF-7 cells were investigated by MTT assays, wound-healing assay and animal study. Results: Results demonstrated that ERbeta-GFP localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the presence of 17beta-estradiol (E2), with stronger fluorescence-signal intensity in the nucleus, 2.8-times higher than that in the cytoplasm. The ERbeta overexpressed MCF-7 cells resulted in a 38.7% decreased growth rate and motility in vitro. Furthermore, ERbeta overexpression enhanced the antiproliferative effects of phytoestrogen, antiestrogen, and histone deacetylase inhibitor. Exogenous ERbeta expression reduced tumor volume by 99% at 27 days postadministration, indicated that overexpression of ERbeta led to retardation of tumor formation and growth in immunodeficient mice. Discussion and conclusion: This study provided a relatively new evidence to support that ERbeta is an important modulator of proliferation and motility of breast cancer cells, and implied for the first time a possibility for the use of novel ERbeta-selective therapies in breast cancer treatment. 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue antiproliferative activity article *breast cancer/et [Etiology] cancer growth cancer inhibition cancer size cell assay cell invasion cell motility cell nucleus cell proliferation *cell strain MCF 7 controlled study cytoplasm drug selectivity drug targeting female genetic transfection growth inhibition histopathology human human cell immune deficiency in vitro study mouse nonhuman nucleotide sequence *prognosis protein analysis protein expression *protein function protein localization tumor xenograft wound healing cathepsin D/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] green fluorescent protein messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] trichostatin A/pd [Pharmacology]","839-849","50","2012",-1

He","Genistein inhibits the stemness properties of prostate cancer cells through targeting Hedgehog-Gli1 pathway","Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are involved in tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Conventional anticancer therapeutics failed to eradicate CSCs, which may eventually lead to the disease relapse and metastasis. Therefore, targeting prostate CSCs may be an ideal strategy to cure PCa. Genistein is a major isoflavone constituent of soybeans and soy products, which has been shown to exhibit potent anticancer effect on many cancers. We have previously reported that genistein can inhibit PCa cell invasion by reversing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, suggesting that genistein may be effective against metastatic PCa. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that PCa tumorsphere cells (TCs) possess CSC properties. Here, we found that tumorsphere formation and colony formation of Pca cells were noticeably suppressed in the presence of genistein. Pretreatment of PCa TCs with genistein also suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. Additionally, genistein treatment inhibited tumor growth of PCa TCs. Further studies showed that genistein treatment not only led to the down-regulation of PCa CSC markers CD44 in vitro and in vivo, but also inhibited Hedgehog-Gli1 pathway, which may contribute to the anti-CSC effect of genistein in PCa TCs. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that genistein may be a dietary phytochemical with potential to target prostate CSCs. 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue antineoplastic activity article cancer cell culture cancer combination chemotherapy cancer inhibition cancer prevention cancer stem cell cancer survival carcinogenicity concentration response controlled study down regulation drug effect drug efficacy drug mechanism drug potency drug targeting gene expression regulation gli1 gene human human cell in vivo study male mouse nonhuman priority journal *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] protein expression protein function signal transduction treatment duration tumor gene docetaxel/cb [Drug Combination] docetaxel/cm [Drug Comparison] docetaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] docetaxel/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *genistein/cb [Drug Combination] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] Hermes antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *sonic hedgehog protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *transcription factor Gli1/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]","48-57","323","2012",-1

At initial presentation, patients are at high risk for bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may be exacerbated by immediate chemotherapy. Except in patients with marked leukocytosis, ATRA should precede chemotherapy. ATRA is available as 10 mg capsules and should be ingested orally and not crushed. The capsules cannot, therefore, be used in patients unable to swallow, or administered by NGT. Patients and Methods: We present two APL cases where patients unable to swallow and acutely bleeding, received ATRA via NGT. ATRA capsules were opened, the free powder aspirated into a glass syringe, and the remaining capsule contents suspended in soy bean oil and aspirated into the same syringe (Shaw, 1995). Case 1: A 33-year-old female with juvenile onset diabetes and blindness presented with fever vaginal bleeding and coma with response only to painful stimuli. Her white blood count (WBC) was 0.5 k/MicroL with 27% bands, 20% lymphocytes and 10% promyelocytes; platelets were 18 K and PT/PTT was 14.7/33. Bone marrow (BM) was replaced by cells with granular cytoplasm and bilobed nuclei. PML-RARa was not detected by cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), but was by PCR. Daunorubicin was administered and the ATRA oil suspension was given on 14 successive days. Hematologic recovery had occurred by day 16, PCR was negative for PML-RARa by 20, and following consolidation she remains in complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after 7 months. MRI revealed white matter changes but after IV-HGG she regained consciousness. Case 2: A 66-year-old man with coronary artery disease presented with fever, rectal bleeding and pulmonary hemorrhage, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. WBC was 7.9 with 3% bands, 19% lymphocytes and 22% promyelocytes. Platelet count was 13 and PT/PTT was 9.6/23.6. BM confirmed APL, with FISH positive for PML-RARa. He was started on ATRA oil suspension via NG tube and daunorubicin. By day 27 FISH was PML-RARa negative, but he continued to require ventilatory support for 3 weeks and succumbed to pneumonia and septic shock. Conclusion: In two patients unable to swallow and bleeding, ATRA administration as an oil suspension via NGT was safe and effective, inducing cytogenetic remission in both.

We investigated the effects of oral gestation-lactation exposure to 1 mg/kg body weight daily dose of the estrogenic soy-isoflavone genistein and/or the anti-androgenic food contaminant vinclozolin in female rats. The SSGs of female offspring were collected at postnatal day 35 to study gland morphogenesis and mRNA expression of sex-hormone receptors and endocrine growth factors as sex-dependent biomarkers. Because of high expression in neonatal SSG, mRNA expression of transforming growth factor alpha was also studied. Exposure to genistein, vinclozolin, or a genistein+vinclozolin mixture resulted in significantly lower numbers of striated ducts linked to an increase in their area and lower acinar proliferation (Ki-67-positive nuclei). Exposure to the mixture had the highest significant effects, which were particularly associated with repression of epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, and transforming growth factor alpha expression. In conclusion, early exposure to low doses of genistein and vinclozolin can affect glandular structure and endocrine gene mRNA expression in prepubertal SSG in female rats, and the effects are potentialized by the genistein+vinclozolin mixture. Our study provides the first evidence that SSG are targeted by both estrogenic and anti-androgenic disrupting compounds and are more sensitive to mixtures. 2012 by The Author(s).",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article female gene expression *lactation morphogenesis nonhuman pregnancy priority journal protein expression rat *submandibular gland epidermal growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/po [Oral Drug Administration] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] nerve growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] transforming growth factor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *vinclozolin/pd [Pharmacology]","593-604","40","2012",-1

Candidate drugs from the MTT assay need in vivo models to test their efficiency and to assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of the drugs. An in vivo screening model could increase the rate of development of anti-cancer drugs. Here, we used zebrafish to screen a library of 502 natural compounds and compared the results with those from an MTT assay of the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. We identified 59 toxic compounds in the zebrafish screen, 21 of which were also identified by the MTT assay, and 28 of which were already known for their anti-cancer and apoptosis-inducing effects. These compounds induced apoptosis and activated the p53 pathway in zebrafish within 3. h treatment. Our results indicate that zebrafish is a simple, reliable and highly efficient in vivo tool for cancer drug screening, and could complement the MTT assay. 2012 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"animal cell apoptosis article breast cancer cancer cell culture controlled study drug potency drug screening embryo embryo development in vivo study nonhuman priority journal zebra fish alpha chaconine/an [Drug Analysis] amphotericin B/an [Drug Analysis] antimycin A1/an [Drug Analysis] *antineoplastic agent/an [Drug Analysis] australine/an [Drug Analysis] beta lapachone/an [Drug Analysis] brefeldin A/an [Drug Analysis] bufalin/an [Drug Analysis] camptothecin/an [Drug Analysis] capsaicin/an [Drug Analysis] chelidonine/an [Drug Analysis] cinobufagin/an [Drug Analysis] cycloheximide/an [Drug Analysis] cytochalasin E/an [Drug Analysis] daidzein/an [Drug Analysis] deguelin/an [Drug Analysis] echinomycin/an [Drug Analysis] epibatidine/an [Drug Analysis] gliotoxin/an [Drug Analysis] harmine/an [Drug Analysis] hypocrellin A/an [Drug Analysis] ivermectin/an [Drug Analysis] menadione/an [Drug Analysis] narasin/an [Drug Analysis] plumbagin/an [Drug Analysis] podophyllotoxin/an [Drug Analysis] rotenone/an [Drug Analysis] sanguinarine/an [Drug Analysis] unindexed drug vinpocetine/an [Drug Analysis]","85-90","422","2012",-1

Nutrients, herbals and dietary supplements are major constituents of nutraceuticals which make them instrumental in maintaining health, act against various disease conditions and thus promote the quality of life. Epidemiological and clinical studies have demonstrated the relationship between diet and health status. It is well known that populations consuming a large proportion of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains and cereals or those with a high intake of seafoods, have a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. Functional foods and nutraceuticals may provide a means to reduce the increasing burden on the health care system by a continuous preventive mechanism Therefore; interest has been expressed in functional foods, nutraceuticals and dietary supplements. Functional foods are defined as being similar in appearance to conventional foods, are consumed as part of a usual diet, and are known to improve health status and render physiological effects beyond basic nutritional function expected of conventional foods. Chemoprevention is the use of small molecules, including dietary or herbal chemicals, to prevent diseases, as opposed to chemotherapeutics, where chemicals, mostly synthetic, are used to remove or alleviate the symptom of diseases. However, nutraceuticals are products produced from foods, but sold in the medicinal form of capsule, tablet, powder, solution, or potion.

In this study, neonatal piglets were breast-fed or were fed milk formula (MF) or soy formula (SF) from PND 2 until sacrifice at PND21. Commercial formulas were used with modifications to meet pig NRC recommendations. Serum cholesterol was lower in piglets fed formula relative to breast-feeding (P<0.05) and serum triglycerides were elevated in SF piglets (P<0.05). Iron accumulation was greater in the liver of formula-fed piglets (P<0.05). Affymetrix array analysis revealed >2-fold changes in gene expression in 57 hepatic genes in MF vs. breast-fed and 124 hepatic genes in SF vs. breast-fed piglets with 44 genes in common. mRNA encoding CYP7A1, the rate limiting enzyme in conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, and hepcidin, a major regulator of hepatic iron traffic, were significantly elevated in formula-fed piglets and appear to explain the differences in cholesterol and iron homeostasis associated with formula feeding. In addition, SF specific increases were observed in hepatic CYP3A enzyme mRNA, apoprotein and activities (P<0.05). In contrast, no consistent effects of SF feeding were observed on expression of 6 estrogen responsive hepatic genes.

Serum osteocalcin concentration was significantly higher in any OVX diet with beans than in the same diet without, but urinary deoxypyridinoline excretion was lowest in the OVX-C group. There were no significant differences in BMD or BMC of the right femur, tibia, or lumbar spine or in the trabecular bone volume of the tibia among the diet groups.

In this study, using microarray analysis and Ingenuity Pathways AnalysisTM, we identified genes (up- or down-regulated, > 1.5 fold, P < 0.001), functions and signaling pathways that were altered following treatment with an inhibitory concentration of genistein (50 mug/ml) in UtLM cells. Downregulation of TGF-beta signaling pathway genes, activin A, activin B, Smad3, TGF-beta2 and genes related to cell cycle regulation, with the exception of the upregulation of the CDK inhibitor P15, were identified and validated by real-time RT-PCR studies. Western blot analysis further demonstrated decreased protein expression of activin A and Smad3 in genistein-treated UtLM cells. Moreover, we found that activin A stimulated the growth of UtLM cells, and the inhibitory effect of genis-tein was partially abrogated in the presence of activin A. Overexpression of activin A and Smad3 were found in tissue samples of leiomyoma compared to matched myometrium, supporting the contribution of activin A and Smad3 in promoting the growth of UtLM cells. Taken together, these results suggest that down-regulation of activin A and Smad3, both members of the TGF-beta pathway, may offer a mechanistic explanation for the inhibitory effect of a high-dose of genistein on UtLM cells, and might be potential therapeutic targets for treatment of clinical cases of uterine leiomyomas.

In order to clarify the efficacy of genistein aglycone in the management of the underlying metabolic processes of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO), the following studies were conducted. The first study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of genistein aglycone in the preventive management of GIOinduced bone loss and osteonecrosis of the femoral head. In addition to a steady decrease in bone formation, a rapid weakening of bone architecture and an increase in fracture risk, chronic administration of glucocorticoids also cause avasuclar necrosis. A Sprague-Dawley rat model of GIO was used in this study, in which 28 female rats received injections of 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone (MP), MP + genistein (5 mg/kg, equivalent to 54 mg/day in humans), genistein alone or vehicle for 60 days. At the end of treatment, genistein was found to not only maintain but also increase BMD and bone mineral content (BMC). Serum levels of the bone formation marker, bone-alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) were increased in the genistein group, while levels of carboxy-terminal collagen cross links (CTX), a bone resorption maker were reduced. Administration of genistein succeeded in preserving femoral breaking strength and prevented osteonecrosis, bone erosion and maintained a normal bone architecture equivalent to the vehicle group. A second study aimed to assess how genistein aglycone compared in effectiveness with alendronate. A similar animal model was used, in which GIO was induced by daily injections of MP (30 mg/kg) followed by treatment with genistein (5 mg/kg), alendronate (0.03 mg/kg) or vehicle for an additional 60 days. The genistein group demonstrated a greater increase in BMD, BMC, and in breaking strength compared to animals treated with alendronate. As seen in the previous study, the genistein treated animals also had significantly increased b-ALP serum levels and CTX levels. Genistein showed positive histological evidence of reducing bone and cartilage erosion and was able to reverse GIO more effectively than alendronate. Collectively, these results suggest that naturally derived isoflavones like genistein aglycone might be a potential new therapy for the prevention of GIO, the most important secondary cause of osteoporosis in humans. Genistein aglycone may also prevent necrotic deterioration of the femoral head caused by glucocorticoid use and could represent a unique therapy that combines powerful boneforming as well as anti-resorptive activity.

Knowledge and perception of primary care physicians towards management of postmenopausal symptoms are deficient. Aim: The aim of the present study was to explore knowledge and attitude of primary care doctors towards management of postmenopausal symptoms. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional survey that was conducted from October to December 2010 in the five health regions in Kuwait. Two centers were selected randomly from each health region. All physicians who were currently working in the selected centers were asked to participate in the study. Out of 209 physicians, 142 agreed to participate and completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: The study revealed that 82.4% of physicians had moderate knowledge about treatment options for postmenopausal symptoms, 88.0% discussed postmenopausal symptoms with their patients, and 45.1% of them either described or referred their patients for hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). The correct answers regarding 10 statements related to the Women Health Initiative finding were ranging from 2.8% to 78.9% which indicated low level of knowledge. Regarding the effectiveness of hormonal replacement therapy in postmenopausal women, the majority of the physicians agreed correctly that HRT is effective in prevention of osteoporosis (87.3%), treatment of vasomotor symptoms (83.7%), and treatment of vulvo-vaginal symptoms (82.4%). There was a variation among physicians opinion about the effectiveness of certain treatment options for managing hot flushes in postmenopausal women. Conclusion: The results suggest that there is a lack of primary care physicians knowledge and confidence in recognizing signs and symptoms of menopause and in identifying and prescribing appropriate management. 2012 .",NA,"abdominal pain/dt [Drug Therapy] abdominal pain/si [Side Effect] adult aged Alzheimer disease/dt [Drug Therapy] Angelica sinensis article breast cancer cancer risk cardiovascular disease/dt [Drug Therapy] cardiovascular disease/pc [Prevention] cognitive defect/dt [Drug Therapy] cognitive defect/pc [Prevention] combination chemotherapy controlled study cross-sectional study dementia/dt [Drug Therapy] depression/dt [Drug Therapy] depression/si [Side Effect] drug approval drug contraindication drug efficacy female ginseng heart infarction high risk patient hormone substitution hot flush/dm [Disease Management] hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] human ischemic heart disease/dt [Drug Therapy] Kuwait lifestyle modification liver disease low drug dose male medical education *menopausal syndrome/dm [Disease Management] *menopausal syndrome/pc [Prevention] *menopausal syndrome/th [Therapy] monotherapy osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] physician *physician attitude prescription *primary medical care *professional knowledge red clover sexual behavior single drug dose stroke/dt [Drug Therapy] uterus disease vagina bleeding vasomotor disorder/dt [Drug Therapy] vein thrombosis vulvovaginal disease/dt [Drug Therapy] wrinkle yam alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] belladonna alkaloid plus ergotamine tartrate plus phenobarbital/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/dt [Drug Therapy] conjugated estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] gabapentin/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] *hormone/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] mirtazapine/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo primrose oil/dt [Drug Therapy] serotonin uptake inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] trazodone/dt [Drug Therapy] venlafaxine/dt [Drug Therapy]","167-173","48","2012",-1

Alterations in their metabolism have been associated with several pathologies. For this reason, therapeutic strategies based on the design of small molecules to restore sphingolipid levels to their physiological condition have rapidly emerged. In addition, some of these new chemical entities, even if they fail to succeed along the pipeline, can become valuable pharmacological tools for the study of sphingolipid function. Implications of altered sphingolipid metabolism in cancer progression have allowed the identification of new targets for the development of potential anticancer agents. Based on these premises, this review is focused on the most recent achievements in the field, with special attention to the development of small molecules, mainly enzyme inhibitors, able to disrupt some of the key sphingolipid metabolic pathways implicated in cancer progression. On the other hand, metabolic dysregulation can also be modulated by the use of sphingolipid analogs, which can alter the sphingolipid balance driving cells to death or survival and thus becoming useful candidates for subsequent drug development. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"apoptosis article breast cancer cancer cell culture cancer growth *cancer therapy carcinogenesis cell death cell function cell survival cytotoxicity endoplasmic reticulum stress enzyme modification homeostasis human leukemia cell line lipid metabolism lipogenesis ovary cancer phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phosphorylation tumor growth carnitine palmitoyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] ceramidase/ec [Endogenous Compound] ceramide/ec [Endogenous Compound] ceramide glucosyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] ceramide kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] curcumin/an [Drug Analysis] curcumin/dv [Drug Development] cyclosporin A/ec [Endogenous Compound] daunorubicin/an [Drug Analysis] daunorubicin/dv [Drug Development] doxorubicin/an [Drug Analysis] doxorubicin/dv [Drug Development] etoposide/an [Drug Analysis] etoposide/dv [Drug Development] fenretinide/an [Drug Analysis] fenretinide/dv [Drug Development] fingolimod/an [Drug Analysis] fingolimod/cb [Drug Combination] fingolimod/dv [Drug Development] fumonisin B1/an [Drug Analysis] fumonisin B1/dv [Drug Development] gamma tocopherol/an [Drug Analysis] gamma tocopherol/dv [Drug Development] gemcitabine/an [Drug Analysis] gemcitabine/dv [Drug Development] genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/dv [Drug Development] gw 4869 irinotecan/an [Drug Analysis] irinotecan/cb [Drug Combination] irinotecan/dv [Drug Development] n oleoylethanolamine/an [Drug Analysis] n oleoylethanolamine/dv [Drug Development] paclitaxel/an [Drug Analysis] paclitaxel/dv [Drug Development] resveratrol/an [Drug Analysis] resveratrol/dv [Drug Development] safingol/an [Drug Analysis] safingol/cb [Drug Combination] safingol/dv [Drug Development] sg 12 sg 14 sma 7 sorafenib/an [Drug Analysis] sorafenib/dv [Drug Development] *sphingolipid/ec [Endogenous Compound] sphingomyelin/ec [Endogenous Compound] sphingosine 1 phosphate/ec [Endogenous Compound] sphingosine kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] sphingosine kinase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] tricyclo[4.3.0.1]decan 9 yl xanthogenate unclassified drug unindexed drug valspodar/an [Drug Analysis] valspodar/dv [Drug Development] vincristine/an [Drug Analysis] vincristine/dv [Drug Development]","285-302","12","2012",-1

Basaga","Bcl-2 inhibitors: Emerging drugs in cancer therapy","Dose-limiting toxicity to healthy tissues is among the major hurdles in anticancer treatment along with intrinsic or acquired multi-drug resistance. Development of small molecule inhibitors (SMI) specific for antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is a novel approach in a way that these antagonists are aimed to interfere with specific protein-protein interactions unlike conventional chemo-/radiotherapies. SMIs of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are assumed to compete with proapoptotic Bcl-2s to occupy BH3 docking grooves on the surfaces of antiapoptotic family members. Instead of directly initiating cell death, these inhibitors are intended to decrease apoptotic threshold in tumor cells that were already primed to death. In this regard, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein SMIs have the advantage of lower normal tissue toxicity relative to conventional anticancer therapies that interfere with general mechanisms including DNA synthesis, mitosis and tyrosine kinase activity.

Teixeira","Soya isoflavones, genistein and daidzein: Biological effects on a ER-positive breast cancer cell line","In recent Years the relationship between soya foods and breast cancer has become controversial due to the estrogen-like properties of soyaderived isoflavones. Epidemiological studies suggested that there is a low incidence of breast cancer in countries with high soya intake. Soya contains the isoflavones daidzein and genisteina that are described as selective estrogen receptors modulators (SERM), act as estrogen receptor agonists at lower concentration, but as antagonists at higher concentrations, are related to apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth such as reduction of Bcl-2/Bax ratio, activation of caspases and inhibition of tyrosine kinase. In this study we evaluate and compare the biological effects of a soya extract biotransformed by Aspergillus awamori (SBE) and standards of the major isoflavones, genistein (G) and daidzein (D), on MCF-7aro, an estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell line stably transfected with the aromatase gene. The results showed that cell viability decreased significantly after 48 hour treatment with SBE, G and mixture of D and G in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, it was also observed a decrease in cell proliferation evaluated by the thymidine assay. Morphological studies, using Giemsa and Hoechst staining, demonstrated chromatine condensation and the presence of some vacuoles in cytosol. Interestingly genistein concentration used to achieve similar levels of cell viability or proliferation inhibition was much higher when compared to the concentration of genistein in SBE. Although D, by itself, was not significant, the mixture of D and G provided higher inhibition than G. These results suggest that daidzein may potentiate effect of genistein. Further studies are required to clarify the compounds present in SBE responsible for these effects.",NA,"*soybean *breast cancer *cancer cell culture *menopause cell viability gene Aspergillus awamori cell growth cell vacuole assay apoptosis cell proliferation staining cytosol agonist food *isoflavone derivative *genistein *daidzein estrogen estrogen receptor aromatase protein tyrosine kinase caspase thymidine","199","14","2011",-1

Antonio","Monoclonal antibody: How the bone mass loss should be treated?","AIM: Defining whether monoclonal antibody is a promising therapeutic agent for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis METHODS: A literature review was conducted in a worldwide basis, books and journals and from our own experience. RESULTS: Monoclonal antibody is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds with high affinity to RANK-ligand (RANKL) and prevents interaction of RANKL with its receptor, called RANK. RANKL is a protein expressed by oseoblastic stromal cells and is the primary mediator of osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival. Monoclonal antibody cause rapid, substantial, and sustained suppression of urinary N-telopeptide and increased bone mineral density and reduced the risk of vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and non-vertebral fractures. Blocking this signalling pathway inhibits osteoclast differentiation and activation, and reduces bone resorption. Before monoclonal antibody were sodium fluoride, HRT, calcitonin, etidronate, clodronate, soybeans and other bisphosphonates now. The use of other drug should be kept in mind as a way forward. Bone remodeling is a life-long process where mature bone tissue is removed from the skeleton and new bone tissue is formed, first bone resorption and bone formation after. So, the bone remodeling cycle consists of several phases with a total duration of 3-6 months and 6 months is the interval for monoclonal antibody injection. Osteoblast differentiation is predominantly regulated by Wnts. The canonical Wnt pathway acts as the master regulator of osteogenesis. beta-catenin interacts with T-cell factor-4 or lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 to regulate transcription of Wnt target genes. Studies have resulted in identification of many critical genes and signaling pathways. Aging and oxidative stress is there to study. Interferon , a hormone produced by our bodies holds great promise to osteoporosis. CONCLUSION: Monoclonal antibody pathway is a good track to open many approaches to osteoporosis but what is said in the bibliography about it does not fit the physiology of bone.

Can equol become an alternative therapy to classical estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women?","It has become apparent now that the clinical effectiveness of supplements containing phytoestrogens, so widely advertised nowadays as an alternative to classical estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), depends on the woman's individual ability of their biotransformation into equol [7-hydroxy-3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-chroman]. The main sources of equol are soy (Glycine max) products and red clover (Trifolium pratense) preparations which contain its precursors: daidzin and formononetin, respectively. Could then treatment with pure equol, protect from the consequences of menopause and be devoid of side effects attributed to oestrogen use? The two main organs of concern in the classical ERT are the uterus and the mammary gland where natural estrogens induce hyperplasia and thus may raise the risk of cancer. Therefore, this study evaluated the uterotropic and mammotropic effects of oral equol administration in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of menopause. DESIGN: Sixty OVX Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups (n=12) and fed soy-free chow with the addition of equol (400 mg/kg of chow) or estradiol-3 benzoate (E2B) (4.3 mg/kg of chow). Control animals were fed soy-free chow. After 3 months, animals were sacrificed, blood was collected and the uteri as well as the mammary glands were removed for histological and immunohistochemical evaluation. The expression of selected estrogen responsive genes was also measured using real time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Uterine weights in animals treated with equol were significantly higher, presented histologic features of mild estrogenic stimulation and had greater epithelial height and thickness of the uterine stroma and myometrium compared to controls. Staining for the presence of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) also showed a greater prevalence of the PCNA positive cells in the uterine stroma in animals treated with equol versus controls. Dietary equol also increased significantly uterine insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), progesterone receptor (PR) and complement 3 protein (C3) mRNA levels. Although statistically significant, all these effects were lower in magnitude compared to E2B treatment. The mammary glands of the animals treated with equol had a significantly higher number of terminal ducts and lobules type II compared to controls. This was also apparent in animals treated with E2B but also a higher number of lobules type I was seen. Compared to controls, animals treated with equol also had a significantly higher percentage of epithelial mammary PCNA positive cells in terminal ducts and lobules type II. The percentage of epithelial mammary PR positive cells in animals treated with equol was only significantly higher in lobules type II. In animals treated with E2B, the percentage of epithelial mammary PCNA and PR positive cells was significantly higher in all the mammary structures. Summarising, due to its evident uterotropic and mamotropic effects, it is very unlikely for equol to become an alternative therapy to classical estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women. Additionally, the above presented data also question the safety of uncontrolled and unlimited consumption of daidzein and formononetin containing supplements by postmenopausal women.",NA,"*alternative medicine *rat *human *estrogen therapy *menopause *postmenopause *female *mammary gland *uterus red clover staining prevalence myometrium thickness height uterus weight gene precursor soybean Sprague Dawley rat blood model neoplasm stimulation biotransformation risk safety side effect clinical effectiveness hyperplasia *equol estrogen formononetin cycline daidzin estradiol benzoate phytoestrogen daidzein messenger RNA complement component C3 progesterone receptor somatomedin C protein","60-61","14","2011",1

CR does not contain phytoestrogens and has a long tradition for treating menopausal symptoms. Its positive benefit-risk-ratio is officially approved by German Commission E, ESCOP, WHO and HMPC. The multitude of non-standardized extracts, food supplements and CR containing multibotanicals led to inconsistent data regarding efficacy and safety of CR products. However, authorised and standardized medicinal CR products, predominantly an isopropanolic extract (iCR), are thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical studies with consistent results in favour of CR. Internationally published randomized controlled trials of iCR clearly demonstrated its efficacy and safety. Climacteric symptoms were significantly reduced in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, the efficacy of iCR in ameliorating menopausal complaints was equal to tibolone, yet iCR demonstrated a better safety profile. The combination of iCR with St. John's Wort extract also proved to be efficacious for alleviating menopausal complaints even extending its therapeutic spectrum to patients with a pronounced psychological component. Treatment with iCR is well tolerated and does not affect hormone levels or estrogen sensitive tissues like breast or uterus. These clinical findings have been substantiated by a wide range of experimental studies. Breast cancer survivors who used iCR against menopausal complaints even showed a slightly reduced risk for tumour recurrence. A large study sponsored by the German Cancer Aid e.

It may manifest as vaginal soreness, dryness, pruritus, dyspareunia, or bleeding on contact. Unlike symptoms such as hot flushes, vaginal atrophy does not diminish over time and often progresses in severity. However, estrogen therapy is generally recommended for short term use, and local estrogen alternatives may cause irritation and be inconvenient to use. Femarelle (DT56a) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator derived from botanical source, effective at decreasing hot flushes and increasing bone mass. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown it has no increased clotting effect in women and no proliferative effect on breast or uterine tissue. These findings suggest Femarelle may be safe for long-term use. The current study is a pilot examining the use of Femarelle for vaginal atrophy, preceding a large double blind placebo controlled study. Design: 12 post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy (<5% superficial cells on cervical cytology) with at least one moderate-to-severe symptom (dryness, irritation, soreness, dysuria, dyspareunia, or bleeding with coitus) were recruited for a 12-week open-label pilot study in line with the FDA regulatory guideline for vaginal atrophy. Exclusion criteria included any hormone therapy/soy product use or significant soy in diet. Femarelle capsules were given 2X/day for 12 weeks.

Approximately 30% of dermal collagen is diminished during the first 5 years after menopause. Some studies have shown that hormone therapy increases collagen content, elasticity, thickness and hydration in skin, while reducing the wrinkles in postmenopausal women. Soy isoflavones (daidzein, genistein and glycitein) have similar structures to estrogen and exhibit estrogenic activity by binding to estrogen receptors. Equol, which is an active metabolite of daidzein, can be produced in approximately 50% of the Japanese and 20-30% of the US population after consumption of soy. The ability to produce equol depends on the presence of certain intestinal microorganism. We recently isolated and identified a lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus 20-92, that metabolizes daidzein to S-equol. Using this strain, we successfully produced a fermented soy food containing natural S-equol. Clinical studies have shown the beneficial effects of natural S-equol supplement on menopausal symptoms and bone metabolism in postmenopausal Japanese women. However, the efficacy of oral intake of S-equol on skin aging in humans is unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of natural 5-equol on the skin aging in Japanese postmenopausal women. Design: The study was conducted with a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled design. Healthy postmenopausal women aged 45-65 years, who were equol non-producers, were recruited for the study. The women were less than 5 years since the onset of menopause One hundred and one subjects were divided into three groups, namely, EQL10 group (n =34, lOmg of equol/d), EQL30 group(n = 33,30mg of equol/d), and placebo group (n = 34, Omg of equol/d). Placebo or natural 5-equol supplement were orally ingested twice a day for 12 weeks. Skin parameters of crow's feet wrinkles (area and depth), hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and elasticity were measured at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks during treatment. Blood biochemical and endocrinological (sex and thyroid hormones) tests were carried out at the same time as skin parameters measurements. For the assessment of reproductive organs (uterus) and breasts safety of natural 5-equol supplement, vaginal cytodiagnosis, endometrial thickness and mammography were performed before and after treatment. Results: No statistically significant difference was observed at baseline values of wrinkle area and maximum largest wrinkle depth between groups. Wrinkle area in the EQL30 group was significantly lower compared to or vs. the placebo group at 12 weeks. The wrinkle areas in both the EQL10 and EQL30 groups were significantly decreased over the treatment period (P = 0.029 and P = 0.004, respectively). The maximum largest wrinkle depth was significantly lower in EQL30 group compared to placebo group at 4 (P = 0.002) and 12 weeks (P = 0.015). In addition, the change in maximum largest wrinkle depth over the treatment period was significantly different between EQL30 and placebo group (P = 0.001). Both of the area and maximum largest depth in wrinkle showed a dose-dependent improvement by natural S-equol supplementation (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017, respectively). No statistically significant differences were observed in skin hydration, TEWL or skin elasticity among the groups. There are no serious gynecological adverse events on uterine or breast tissues, and no significant effects on hormone status during consumption of natural 5-equol for 10 or 30 mg/day. Conclusion: Oral administration of 10 mg and 30 mg 5-equol/day for 12 weeks improved crow's feet wrinkles in equol non-producing Japanese menopausal women without serious adverse events.

The difference in soy consumption between Asia and Western is involved in the health status in each area. Previous studies showed that the incidence of breast and prostate cancers is much lower in Asian than in the Western population, which might suggest that intake of soy relates to the reducing risk of those cancers in Asian countries. Soy isoflavones (daidzein, genistein and glycitein) have been reported to prevent the hormone-related cancers, although people still have not a few concerns of their estrogenic effects. Equol is a metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein, which was produced by intestinal bacteria, then equol may be involved in the prevalence of these types of cancer as well as soy isoflavones. The frequency of equol producers is approximately 30% in Western population while approximately 50% in Japanese. Tiny and ignorable amount of equol is existed in the limited foods (i.e. milk and egg yolk). Thus, only produced amount of equol from daidzein in the body can affect the amount of equol exposure. To date, only a few studies have been reported in terms of the produced amount of equol in Japanese. Therefore, this study was developed to understand the levels and potential benefits for a safety and effective amount of equol exposure in healthy Japanese adults. Data of the 24h urinary excretion of equol was evaluated as potential scientific data point for evidence regarding the typical daily dose of exposure. So, we could know daily physiological range of equol exposure in healthy Japanese adults. Design: 13 epidemiological studies, 1,345 subjects (545 men, 492 premenopausal women, and 308 postmenopausal women) participated, were conducted from 1996 to 2010. All subjects had no current or past history of serious illness. A questionnaire survey was used to confirm the health and menopause status. The 24h urine of the participants was collected under the conditions of their normal daily life (no restrictions of soy foods). Alcohol intake was prohibited during the 24h urine collection. The urine samples were enzymaticalfy deconjugated, and daidzein, genistein, and equol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The 24h urinary excretions of the isoflavones and equol were determined using the values measured by HPLC. If the subjects had equol levels that were above the detection limit (0.27 nmol/mL), they were defined as equol excretors. All studies were performed with the approval of the human studies institutional review board for each participating institution. Results: The frequency of equol excretors was 36.3% among men, 33.3% among premenopausal women, and 52.6% among postmenopausal women. The total number of equol excretors was 524, then the minimum amount of 24h urinary excretion of equol was 0.4 umol/day (0.1 mg/day), the maximum was 318.0 umol/day (77.0 mg/day), the 50th percentile was 12.5 umol/day (3.0 mg/day), and the 95th percentile was 119.2 umol/day (28.9 mg/day). For equol, daidzein and genistein, premenopausal women had significantly lower values than men or postmenopausal women (equol; P<0.001, daidzein: P<0.001, and genistein: P<0.001 versus men or postmenopausal women, respectively). The 24h urinary excretion of equol in postmenopausal women was significantly higher than that of men (P=0.004), but there were no differences for daidzein or genistein between these groups. Conclusion: The results of the present study showed that the 24h urinary equol excretion was 0.1-77.0 mg/day in the equol excretors. This range would be physiological exposure of equol in healthy Japanese population.

Leitman","Tissue selective estrogen receptor a agonists reverse weight gain without causing mammary gland or uterine proliferation","Objective: Long-term estrogen deficiency increases the risk of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women. Menopausal hormone therapy containing estrogens might prevent these conditions, but its prolonged use increases the risks of breast cancer, strokes and thromboembolic events. Animal studies indicate that the beneficial effects of estrogens in adipose tissue and adverse effects in the mammary gland and uterus are mediated by estrogen receptor alpha (ERot). One strategy to prevent obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome is to improve the safety of estrogens by developing tissue selective ERa drugs that act as agonists in adipose tissue, but not in tie mammary gland and uterus. To date, tissue selective ERa agonists have not been identified. Design: We considered plant extracts as a source of tissue selective ERa agonists and screened multiple extracts using transfection assays. Numerous plant extracts were screened for ERa activity by transfecting U20S cells with the classic estrogen responsive element (ERE) upstream a minimal thymidine kinase promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (ERE fk-Luc) and an expression vector for human ERa. Based on these findings we selected two plant extracts that we used in a high fat diet fed mouse model to examine if they reverse weight gain and fat accumulation. Potential adverse proliferative effects of the plant extracts in the mammary gland and uterus were assessed in a mouse model where treatment time was 49 days. Last, to examine the tissue specific effects of the plant extracts at the genomic level, we compared gene expression profiles in gonadal fat, mammary gland and uterus in response to estradiol and the extracts. Results: Extracts from two plants, Radix Glycyrrhiza uralensis (RG) and Radix Pueraria lobata (RP) selectively activated multiple ERa responsive reporters, and reversed weight gain and fat accumulation comparable to estradiol in ovariectomized obese mice maintained on high fat diet. Unlike estradiol, RG and RP did not induce proliferative effects on the mammary gland and uterus. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that RG and RP induced estrogen-like regulation of genes in abdominal fat, but not in the mammary gland and uterus. RG and RP also behaved differently than the SERMs, raloxifene and tamoxifen, because they did not antagonize the effects of estradiol. Conclusion: The compounds in extracts from RG and RP might constitute the first class of tissue selective ERa agonists to prevent and/or reverse weight gain, fat accumulation, metabolic syndrome and other conditions in postmenopausal women.",NA,"*agonist *weight gain *mammary gland *uterus *menopause *society *tissues female metabolic syndrome X human lipid storage animal experiment lipid diet obesity model diabetes mellitus postmenopause risk mouse adipose tissue gene expression expression vector breast cancer reporter gene promoter region estrogen responsive element assay genetic transfection hormonal therapy safety adverse drug reaction thromboembolism abdominal fat gene expression profiling mouse mutant Pueraria lobata Glycyrrhiza uralensis gene stroke plant estrogen deficiency *estrogen receptor plant extract estradiol estrogen luciferase thymidine kinase estrogen receptor alpha tamoxifen raloxifene","1348","18","2011",1
"741","656"," M. J. Minkin","Quality of life: Alternatives to hormone therapy for vasomotor symptoms","80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal transition. Women with breast cancer can be even more symptomatic; if they are premenopausal at time of diagnosis, chemotherapy often renders them suddenly hypoestrogenic. If they are already postmenopausal and on hormonal therapy, they will be required to stop. Virtually all women with estrogen receptor positive tumors will be treated with either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, further exacerbating their vasomotor symptoms. Although the most efficacious of the available therapies for managing vasomotor symptoms, namely estrogen, is contraindicated in this population, several categories of relief do remain available. Lifestyle changes that have been shown to mitigate severity of vasomotor symptoms include smoking cessation, exercise, and weight loss; adoption of healthier lifestyle measures may even impact on the overall survival. Paced respiration and acupuncture have been tried, with mixed results on efficacy, but not controversial on safety. lHerbal and botanical approaches may be helpful. Controversies do exist over both the efficacy and safety of both isoflavones and black cohosh in this population. Non hormonal medications have been prescribed widely; SSRI's and SNRTs are widely used in this group of patients. However, given the special emotional vulnerability of the relatively young cancer survivors to potential side effects of anti-depressants, such as decreased libido and weight gain, these medications need to be prescribed judiciously. Special consideration is merited in tamoxifen users, as certain SSRI's such as paroxetine can interact with tamoxifen's metabolism, hence risking reduction in chemo-efficacy of tamoxifen. Gabapentin has been used in breast cancer survivors as well. Older therapies such as antihypertensives are rarely used currently, given side effects and minimal efficacy. Given that sleep disruption often accompanies vasomotor complaints, consideration needs to be given to adjunctive use of sleep medications in this population. Vaginal atrophy is a common accompaniment to vasomotor symptoms, and contributor to the overall compromised quality of life particularly in the relatively young experiencing abrupt menopause. Symptoms of vaginal discomfort thus must be enquired in those experiencing vasomotor symptoms; while alternative therapies such as polycarbophil moisturizers have shown promise in providing symptomatic relief, judicial use of vaginal estrogen therapy may be a consideration for some, given the minimal systemic absorption with the use of low dose rings, tablets, and creams. Given the increased use of SERM's and projected possible use of aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer chemoprevention, alternative therapies for vasomotor symptoms will become even more relevant. Potential use of TSECs in this population may prove beneficial in symptom prevention as well.",NA,"*hormonal therapy *menopause *society *quality of life female population human breast cancer drug therapy side effect sleep cancer survivor safety alternative medicine therapy weight reduction exercise tumor smoking cessation weight gain lifestyle modification chemotherapy climacterium libido disorder diagnosis chemoprophylaxis metabolism low drug dose patient vagina atrophy Cimicifuga racemosa estrogen therapy humidifier acupuncture absorption vaginal discomfort tablet overall survival prevention lifestyle tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor gabapentin antihypertensive agent estrogen receptor paroxetine estrogen polycarbophil isoflavone derivative serotonin uptake inhibitor selective estrogen receptor modulator","1340","18","2011",-1

However, despite of several studies performed with phytoestrogens, their risks and benefits are not yet well established. Materials and methods: The main objective of our study was to investigate the impact of estrogen and phytoestrogens on the proliferation and motility behavior of two breast cancer cell lines (the estrogen receptor positive MCF-7 and the estrogen receptor negative MDA-MB-231) as compared with a nontumorigenic breast cell line (MCF-12A). Cells were incubated in either regular or phenol red-free culture media supplemented with charcoal-stripped serum (FBS). Results: Our study showed that when cultured in phenol redfree media supplemented with charcoal stripped FBS, all cell lines present lower proliferation rates and decreased motility, as evaluated by the sulphorhodamine dye assay and the fluorescent phagokinetic assay, respectively. Furthermore, in the presence of Enterolactone and Enterodiol, MCF-7 cell proliferation (100 nM-10 muM) was decreased. In contrast with 17-beta estradiol (E2), Enterodiol (100 nM-10 muM) does not increase cell proliferation in MCF-12A cells. Conclusion: Although more studies are clearly needed, the data suggest that both enterodiol and enterolactone appear to have a different impact in terms of motility and proliferation of breast tumor and non-tumor cells, which warrants a closer look on these compounds as safer alternatives for HRT.",NA,"*breast cell *cell proliferation *society cell line assay hormone substitution tumor cell breast tumor culture medium human cell strain MCF 7 cancer cell culture female breast cancer risk menopause serum plant *estrogen *phytoestrogen enterodiol estradiol charcoal enterolactone estrogen receptor phenolsulfonphthalein dye phenol","10","42","2012",-1

While correlating docking scores with inhibitory potencies of known ligands, feeble robustness of scoring functions toward prediction was observed. This prompted us to develop new prediction models using stepwise regression analysis based on consensus of different docking and their scoring methods (gold, LigandFit, and glide). Quantitative structure-activity relationships were developed between the aromatase inhibitory activity (pIC50) of flavonoid derivatives (n=39) and docking scores and docking descriptors. QSAR models have been validated internally [using leave-one-out cross-validated )] and externally to ensure the predictive capacity of the models. Model 2 [M2] developed using consensus of docking scores of scoring functions viz. ASP, potential of mean force and DOCK Score (=0.850, r2=0.870, = 0.633, RMSE = 0.363 mum, r2m(test)=0.831, r2m(overall)=0.832) was found to be better in predicting aromatase inhibitory potency (pIC50) compared to the Model 1 [M1] based on docking descriptors (= 0.848, r2=0.825, =0.788, RMSE=0.421mum, r2m(test)=0.808, r2m(overall)=0.821). It has been observed that the natural flavonoids and their derivatives were less potent compared to these scaffolds with imidazolylmethyl substitution owing to the interaction of nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring toward the heme (Fe3+) of the aromatase.

The association of post-diagnosis antioxidant use with breast cancer (BC) recurrence and mortality was examined in the Life After Cancer Epidemiology (LACE) Study. Methods: The LACE cohort (n=2,264) consists of women identified primarily through the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry and diagnosed with early stage primary BC from 1997 to 2000; women enrolled approximately two years post-diagnosis. A mailed baseline questionnaire collected data on frequency of antioxidant supplement use since diagnosis (multivitamins +/- minerals, combination multiple carotenoids, beta-carotene, lycopene, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, zinc, coenzyme Q10, soy), and other risk factors. BC outcomes were ascertained yearly by mailed questionnaire and confirmed by chart review. Delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Antioxidant supplement use after diagnosis was reported by 81% of women; 71% used multivitamins, 40% used vitamin C, 48% used vitamin E, and 7% used combination multiple carotenoids. Among antioxidant users, frequent use of vitamin C and vitamin E were associated with decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence (HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.97; HR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.54-0.94, respectively); use of vitamin E was also associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.58-1.00). Conversely, frequent use of combination multiple carotenoids was associated with increased risk of death from breast cancer (HR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.21-3.56) and all causes (HR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.13-2.71), but no such relationship was seen with either beta-carotene or lycopene alone. Conclusions: Frequent use of vitamin C and vitamin E in the period following breast cancer diagnosis was associated with decreased likelihood of recurrence. Frequent use of combination multiple carotenoids during this same period was associated with decreased survival.

Although studies have reported that soy-based meal replacements can favorably impact weight and other metabolic risk factors, meal replacement strategies have not been tested in this population. The objectives of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility of a soy-based meal replacement intervention, to measure changes in anthropometrics and biomarkers, and to measure changes in health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: The 3-month intervention included education sessions, meal replacement products, meal plans, and physical activity promotion. Anthropometrics, blood samples, and questionnaire data were collected. Paired t-tests assessed changes over time in continuous measures. Weights were measured weekly and a mixed model regression analysis assessed change in weight over time. Results: Nineteen women participated in the study (mean age 59 years). When comparing pre and post intervention weights, women lost ~7.5 + 4.9 kg (p < 0.001) and had significant improvements in health-related QOL. Women lost 7.5% of their baseline weight which exceeded our study goal (5% reduction).

PE values, from a recently published food database, were applied to food frequency questionnaire responses to comprehensively assess PE intake of isoflavone, lignan, and total PE, during adolescence and adulthood. Polytomous multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the association between PE intake from foods and breast cancer risk according to tumor subgroups ER+PR+, ER-PR-, and ER+PR-. Preliminary results show that among postmenopausal women, adolescent PE intake was associated with reduced breast cancer risk, and this finding did not vary substantially by hormone receptor status; however, this association was not statistically significant among certain ERPR subgroups.

Tamoxifen was the first agent considered in a preventive setting. Different studies analyzed the role of tamoxifen in prevention and, although the first results were apparently contradictory, they showed notable reductions in breast cancer. In the same period, in the MORE trial, raloxifene unexpectedly produced a larger reduction of breast cancer than was seen for tamoxifen. This result led to other chemoprevention studies to establish the role of raloxifene. Particularly, the STAR trial showed that raloxifene is as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer and has a lower risk of adverse event. At the same time, the third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have shown good efficacy in advanced breast cancer and a low toxicity profile. They offer another approach to prevention, which may be superior or complimentary to the use of Selective Estrogen Receptor Modifiers (SERMs). Currently no AIs have yet been fully evaluated.

A new high efficiency preclinical protocol, the EPI bioassay, reflects the interaction of endocrine, paracrine and immune, (EPI) factors on induced androgen metabolism in human prostate reactive stroma. The bioassay is based on co-culturing human primary prostate stromal cells and LAPC-4 prostatic adenocarcinoma cells in a downscaled format of 96-well-plates for testing multiple doses of multiple target compounds. Metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with or without TGFbeta1-induced stimulation (D + T) of the reactive stroma phenotype was assessed by increased testosterone in the media and PSA production of the epithelial prostate cancer cells. Using the non-metabolizable androgen R1881, effects from direct androgen action were distinguished from stromal androgen production from DHEA. Stromal cell androgenic bioactivity was confirmed using conditioned media from D + T-treated stromal cell monocultures in an androgen-inducible AR screening assay. We further showed that both agonists to estrogen receptor (ER), DPN (ERbeta) and PPT (ERalpha), as well as estrogenic natural compounds including soy isoflavones attenuated D + T-induced PSA production. Studies with the pure ER agonists showed that activating either ERalpha or ERbeta could inhibit both D + T-mediated and R1881-mediated PSA production with the D + T effect being more pronounced.

Soy food consumption has been associated with lower risk of development of breast cancer. However, the ability of soy isoflavones to bind to estrogen receptors, stimulate cell proliferation, and potentially interact with tamoxifen therapy, has raised concern about soy food consumption among breast cancer survivors. Two recent reports from China and one report from the US have suggested that postdiagnosis soy intake may improve prognosis among breast cancer survivors. Methods: We evaluated postdiagnosis soy food intake and breast cancer outcomes using data from the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project, which includes 18,312 women diagnosed with invasive primary breast cancer between ages 20 and 83 years and who participated in four prospective cohorts, three from the US and one from Shanghai, China. In two cohorts, information on soy food intake was assessed using food frequency questionnaires designed to capture soy food intake; two cohorts only collected information on two soy foods (tofu and soy milk), and multiple imputation was applied to derive total isoflavone intake based on information gathered by the US study with comprehensive assessment of soy intake. Delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of isoflavones with total mortality and breast cancer recurrence, adjusted for age at diagnosis, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor status, stage, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, smoking, body mass index, exercise, race/ethnicity, and education and stratified by study. Analyses included 16,048 women with information on soy food intake. Results: After an average follow-up of 9.2 years, a total of 2,592 deaths and 2,622 recurrences were documented. Mean soy isoflavone intake (mg), as assessed at an average of 13 months postdiagnosis (range: 1-48 months), was 3.2 (standard deviation (SD)=5.8) for US women and 45.9 (SD=38.3) for Chinese women. Pooled analyses based on study-specific deciles showed that, compared with the lowest deciles, higher isoflavone intakes were associated with HRs in the range of 0.85-0.89 for mortality and 0.85-0.83 for recurrence (not all HRs were significant). Corresponding HRs restricted to only US cohorts ranged from 0.84-1.04 for mortality and 0.87-0.88 for recurrence, although none were significant.

Bhushan","Biochanin A enhances anticancer activity of temozolomide in glioblastoma multiforme","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most lethal form of primary brain tumor, classified as a Grade IV astrocytoma by World Health Organization (WHO). The poor prognosis of patients is a result of an extremely invasive and aggressive nature of this tumor. Temozolomide, an anticancer agent currently approved for the treatment of glioblastoma is only modestly effective as a single agent in enhancing patient survival. Therefore, it is imperative to design therapies which are safe and can more effectively target the progression of glioblastoma. Our laboratory has been investigating the anticancer properties of biochanin A, a bioactive isoflavone found in red clover and soy products. This compound shows anticancer potential against breast, oral, pancreatic and brain cancers. Previous studies from our laboratory show that biochanin A inhibits invasion in GBM cells. In this study we investigated the anticancer potential of combination of biochanin A and temozolomide on U-87 MG cells (human glioblastoma cell line). We hypothesized that this combination will enhance the efficacy of temozolomide towards inhibiting invasion and proliferation of glioblastoma cells. We performed colony formation assay to assess the cytotoxicity of treatment(s). Biochanin A (20muM and 70muM) enhances the effect of temozolomide in decreasing the number of colonies formed as determined by the colony formation assay. Further, we determined the effect of temozolomide (100muM) alone and in combination with biochanin A (20muM and 70muM) on cell signaling, invasive processes and transcription factors. Western blot analysis shows a decrease in the protein expression of p-EGFR, p-ERK, uPAR, MMP-2. Our results implicate that combining biochanin A with temozolomide can improve the anticancer effect of temozolomide on glioblastoma cells. These findings help us better understand how biochanin A can be used to seek new and more effective combination therapy. Further studies are aimed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which this combination inhibits invasion of U-87 MG cells.",NA,"*cancer research *glioblastoma *antineoplastic activity human colony formation assay laboratory patient therapy astrocytoma world health organization prognosis tumor survival red clover breast brain cancer cell line cytotoxicity Western blotting protein expression brain tumor *biochanin A *temozolomide gelatinase A isoflavone transcription factor antineoplastic agent",NA,"71","2011",-1

For this study we combined consumption of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with two modes of calorie restriction. We utilized six groups of MMTV-Her2/neu mice to represent the approximately 20% of human breast cancers in which Her2/neu is over expressed and for which there are no known chemo-preventive agents available. Starting at 10 weeks of age half of the mice were fed a control diet composed of a modified AIN-93M formula with fat derived from soy oil. The other half consumed a diet with 71.75% of fat calories from EPA. Mice were further divided into ad libitum (AL), chronic calorie restricted (CCR) or intermittent caloric restricted (ICR) groups. AL groups (Control and EPA) received unrestricted access to their diets. CCR groups were given 75% of the total calories that the AL age-matched groups consumed. ICR groups were fed calories equal to 100% of the AL age-matched groups for three weeks followed by three weeks of calories equal to 50% of the AL age-matched groups. Supplemental vitamins and minerals were added to the food for the CCR ands ICR groups. The 6 week cycles of restriction and refeeding were maintained until the mice were 60 weeks of age or were euthanized due to MTs. Mice were weighed weekly and carefully examined for mammary tumors (MTs). Ad Lib Control (Con) and Ad Lib-EPA groups ate similar amounts and gained weight at similar rates. The body weights of the CCR-Con and CCR- EPA were also similar to each other. The ICR-EPA mice were slightly heavier (p<0.05) than the CCR-Con mice despite consuming similar quantities of food. MT incidence was lowest in the ICR-EPA group (15%) and highest in the AL-Con group (87%) while the AL-EPA, CCR-Con, CCR-EPA and ICR-Con had MT incidence rats of 63%, 47%, 40% and 59%, respectively The average survival until terminal end point was also longest in the ICR-EPA group at 59.2 weeks and shortest in the AL-Con group at 52.6 (P<0.0002). The average tumor burden was 0.98 grams for ICR-EPA mice and 1.78 grams for AL-Con mice but due to the very small number of MTs in the ICR-EPA group this was not a significant difference. Preliminary serum microarrays and LC-MS/MS analysis of mammary tissue indicate that EPA decreases proteins associated with inflammation and oxidative phosphorylation suggesting that NFkB may be down-regulated. Ongoing studies seek to better understand this mechanism. These results illustrate that MT inhibition is significantly increased when ICR and EPA are combined as compared to either intervention alone or no intervention. Understanding how this pathway is affected may aid in the development of drugs that could be used for breast cancer prevention.",NA,"*cancer research *breast tumor *caloric restriction *cancer inhibition mouse calorie diet breast cancer food cancer prevention human weight body weight rat survival tumor volume serum breast inflammation oxidative phosphorylation refeeding *icosapentaenoic acid omega 3 fatty acid soybean oil vitamin mineral protein",NA,"71","2011",-1

Grossmann","Factors associated with changes in body weight and the protective effect of chronic versus intermittent calorie restriction on mammary tumorigenesis","To date one of the most effective strategies for the prevention of mammary tumor development is calorie restriction. Reduced incidence and/or extended latency for the development of spontaneously and carcinogen-induced mammary tumors have been documented following various degrees of reduced calorie intake. In the majority of these studies chronic calorie restriction (CCR) has been implemented whereby the animals are given the same amount of reduced calories every day. Although this is easy to implement in experimental conditions, such an approach may have limited application to humans. Interestingly, we have reported that periods of intermittent calorie restriction (ICR) consisting of periods of 50% reduced intake followed by ad libitum refeeding resulting in an overall restriction of 20-25% was more protective than the same degree of restriction implemented in a CCR protocol. In three separate studies transgenic MMTV-TGF-alpha mice fed low-fat AIN93M diets had mammary tumor incidences ranging from 3-15% for ICR mice compared to 27-44% for CCR mice and 68-84% for ad libitum-fed (AL) mice (CEBP 11: 836,2002; Exp Biol Med 232:70,2007; Cancer Prev Res 2:712,2009). In a second strain of transgenic mice also susceptible to mammary tumor development, MMTV-neu, there was no protective effect of CCR while ICR resulted in an ~50% reduction in mammary tumor incidence (Nutrition & Cancer 44:162,2002). To understand why ICR is superior to CCR we have measured circulating growth regulating factors which have been reported to be related to tumorigenesis. In addition we determined protein expression levels of their corresponding receptors in mammary tissues and mammary tumors. We have found that ICR restriction periods are characterized by reductions in serum IGF-I and leptin and following refeeding neither level reached that of AL mice. Further, ICR restriction is characterized by a large increase in the adiponectin:leptin ratio. These observations indicate an environment conducive to reduced cell proliferation and/or enhanced apoptosis based on in vitro studies using human breast cancer cell lines. In mammary tissue CCR and ICR mice had reduced leptin expression compared to AL mice but only ICR mice had elevated AdipoR1 compared to AL and CCR mice, while leptin receptor expression was reduced. Neither CCR nor ICR affected mammary tissue or mammary tumor adiponectin or AdipoR2 expression. Two proteins associated with IGF-I signaling, IGFBP3 and IGF-IR, were also measured, IGFBP3 was higher in mammary tumors from both ICR and CCR mice while only CCR mice had higher expression in mammary tissue. There was no effect of IGF-IRalpha in either tissue. We have conducted two recent studies expanding on our earlier experiments. In the first we fed a higher fat diet to MMTV-TGF-alpha mice to determine if we could overcome the protective effect of ICR. Mice were fed diets to provide the same absolute intake of fat on a daily basis over the course of the study (10-82 weeks of age). Despite the increased fat intake during refeeding the protective effect of ICR was maintained with mammary tumor incidence of 4% obtained for ICR mice compared to 52% for CCR mice and 66% for AL mice. In the second study MMTV-neu mice which were only moderately protected by the ICR protocol in the earlier study were fed reduced calories combined with the addition of the omega-3 fatty acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA, to the diet. This was based on studies that suggested a protective effect of EPA and/or fish oil on mammary tumorigenesis. EPA was included in the diet at 71% of fat calories in a diet where 9% of total calories were supplied as fat. Control diets contained soybean oil as the fat source. Mice were enrolled at 10 weeks of age and followed until 60 weeks of age. EPA included in the AL diet had a modest effect on mammary tumor development resulting in a 28% decrease in incidence from 87% in AL-CONTROL mice to 63% in AL-EPA mice. For the calorie restricted mice CCR-CONTROL and CCR-EPA mice had incidence rates of 47% and 40% respectively while ICR-CONTROL mice had an incidence rate of 59%. EPA combined with ICR reduced mammary tumor incidence to only 15%. Serum and tissue analyses are presently underway including determination of mammary tissue, mammary fat pad and mammary tumor SIRT1 and SIRT3 levels. Although the mechanism of action to explain why ICR is superior to CCR for mammary tumor prevention remains unknown ICR may provide a unique approach for cancer prevention.",NA,"*caloric restriction *carcinogenesis *cancer research *body weight mouse breast tumor calorie diet breast cancer incidence Institute for Cancer Research mouse refeeding incidence cancer prevention serum tissues neoplasm human date (fruit) prevention latent period caloric intake transgenic mouse nutrition protein expression environment cell proliferation apoptosis in vitro study breast cancer cancer cell culture lipid diet fat intake leptin adiponectin soybean oil carcinogen receptor leptin receptor protein omega 3 fatty acid icosapentaenoic acid fish oil",NA,"71","2011",-1

Diets rich in fruits and vegetables are implicated in breast cancer risk reduction, yet underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we addressed whether dietary factors selectively target mammary epithelial cells that display stem-like/progenitor subpopulations with previously recognized tumor-initiating potential. Using estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 and estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell lines and freshly isolated epithelial cells from MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mouse mammary tumors, we demonstrate that sera of adult mice consuming soy isoflavone genistein (GEN) or blueberry (BB) polyphenol-containing diets alter the population of stem-like/progenitor cells, as measured by their functional ability to self-renew and form anchorage-independent spheroid cultures in vitro at low frequency (1-2%). Serum effects on mammosphere formation were dose-dependently replicated by GEN (40 nM >2 muM) and targeted the basal stem-like CD44+/CD24-/ESA+ and the luminal progenitor CD24+ subpopulations in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. GEN inhibition of mammosphere formation was mimicked by the Akt inhibitor perifosine and was associated with enhanced tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) expression. In contrast, a selected mixture of BB phenolic acids was only active in MDA-MD-231 cells and its CD44+/CD24-/ESA+ subpopulation, and this activity was independent of induction of PTEN expression. These findings delineate a novel and selective function of distinct dietary factors in targeting stem/progenitor cell populations in estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent breast cancers.

Di Leo","Dietary, endocrine, and metabolic factors in the development of colorectal cancer","Introduction: Colorectal cancer is the third cause of death in industrialized countries. Genetic susceptibility and diet are determinant of cancer risk and tumor behavior. Variation in cancer incidence among and within populations with similar dietary patterns suggests that an individual response may reflect interactions with genetic factors, which may modify gene, protein, and metabolite expression patterns. Nutrigenomics, defined as the interaction between nutrition and an individual genome, will likely provide important clues about responders and non-responders to nutritional intervention. Discussion: Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest a protective role of some normal components of daily diet (fish oil, milk, and vegetables), estrogens, and phytoestrogens in colorectal cancer. The effect of estrogen seems to be mediated by their binding to estrogen receptor beta (ER-beta), one of the two estrogen receptors with high affinity for these hormones. Very recently, the demonstration of an involvement of ER-beta in the development of adenomatous polyps of the colon has also been documented, suggesting the use of selective ER-beta agonists in primary colorectal cancer prevention. Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds that structurally and functionally act as estrogen agonists in mammals. They are characterized by a higher binding affinity to ER-beta as compared to estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha), the other estrogen receptor subtype. These biological characteristics explain why the administration of phytoestrogens does not produce the classical side effects associated to estrogen administration (cerebro- and cardiovascular accidents, higher incidence of endometrial and breast cancer) and makes these substances potential candidates for colorectal cancer prevention. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"adenomatous polyp apoptosis binding affinity breast cancer cancer incidence cancer prevention colon carcinogenesis colon polyp *colorectal cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *colorectal cancer/et [Etiology] conference paper dietary intake endometrium cancer epigenetics estrogen binding fish gene mutation human insulin resistance meat milk mismatch repair nonhuman obesity priority journal protein expression tumor growth vegetable calcium estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] oil phytoestrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] vitamin D","13-19","43","2012",-1

However, the efficacy for the mitigation of menopausal symptoms and safety of these botanical dietary supplements taken alone or in combination with prescription drugs has not been fully established. The UIC/NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research investigates the safety of botanical dietary supplements that are frequently consumed by women and identifies additional health benefits for disease prevention. One current focus is hops (Humulus lupulus L., Cannabaceae), which are popular botanical dietary supplements for women's health. Recent data suggest that hop products might also have potential as cytoprotective remedies. We have now analyzed the safety and the cytoprotective properties of hop extracts both in vitro and in vivo. The results show that the phytoconstituents of hops demonstrate ligand and tissue specific influences on the detoxification system. We also analyzed the effect of black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) on the efficacy and toxicity of the anti-breast cancer drug, tamoxifen. Since dietary supplements, such as black cohosh and red clover are frequently used as over-the-counter medication for the alleviation of menopausal symptoms, it is important to analyze potential interactions of synthetic drugs, such as tamoxifen, with botanicals. Our data indicate that black cohosh is safe in conjunction with tamoxifen and that the contained triterpenes might moderately reduce some of tamoxifen's side effects without reducing tamoxifen's activity.",NA,"*health *diet supplementation *human *hops *Cimicifuga racemosa *female *neoplasm safety red clover detoxification hot flush breast cancer side effect prophylaxis Humulus lupulus Cannabaceae in vitro study tissues toxicity tamoxifen non prescription drug drug triterpene prescription drug ligand",NA,"77","2011",-1

Thus, modifiable factors influencing the timing of puberty are of public health interest. Childhood overweight as a factor in the earlier onset of menarche has been supported by prospective evidence; nonetheless, its overall contribution may have been overemphasized, since secular trends toward a younger age at menarche have not been a universal finding during the recent obesity epidemic. Current observational studies suggest notable associations between dietary intakes and pubertal timing beyond contributions to an energy imbalance: children with the highest intakes of vegetable protein or animal protein experience pubertal onset up to 7 months later or 7 months earlier, respectively. Furthermore, girls with high isoflavone intakes may experience the onset of breast development and peak height velocity approximately 7-8 months later. These effect sizes are on the order of those observed for potentially neuroactive steroid hormones. Thus, dietary patterns characterized by higher intakes of vegetable protein and isoflavones and lower intakes of animal protein may contribute to a lower risk of breast cancer or a lower total mortality. 2012 International Life Sciences Institute.",NA,"article body composition breast development caloric intake dietary intake effect size energy balance fat intake human longitudinal study menarche *obesity observational study protein intake *puberty isoflavone steroid hormone trace element vegetable protein","133-152","70","2012",-1

Administration of soy flour (10 and 15% as diet) seven consecutive days as preventive intervention suppresses the lipidperoxidation (LPO), xanthine oxidase (XO) and release of serum toxicity marker enzymes viz., SGOT, LDH and SGPT significantly (p<0.001).

The present study investigated the effect of a novel isoflavone-derived anti-estrogenic compound developed in our laboratory, the N-t-boc-hexylenediamine derivative of 7-(O)-carboxymethyl daidzein [cD-tboc] in human thyroid cancer cells. First: the mRNA expression of estrogen receptor a and b (ERa and ERb) was confirmed in several human thyroid cancer cell lines, in human non-malignant, in goiterous cells and in papillary thyroid cancer cells harvested during thyroidectomy. All cell types expressed both ERa and ERb with a variably higher abundance of ERb over ERa. Second: DNA synthesis and creatine kinase (a marker of estrogenic genomic response) were increased in response to estradiol-17b (E2), the ERa agonist PPT as well as the ERb agonist DPN. Third: as determined by DNA synthesis, the XTT assay and direct microscopic visualization, cD-tboc markedly inhibited cell growth in all types of human thyroid cancer by-60-90%, be it of cell line- or patient-derived origin and also slowed down, albeit to a lesser extent, the growth of non-cancerous human thyroid cells (0-50%). Very significantly, cD-tboc abolished E2-induced cell growth in cancer cells, but only partially in goiter and normal cells (70 vs. 45%). Fourth: functionally critical for the growth-inhibitory effect of cD-tboc was its ability to increase (ROS) formation, since inhibition of NADPH-oxidase activity by DPI not only abolished ROS formation, but also partially inhibited the cytotoxic effects of cD-tboc. Fifth: cD-tboc could not induce cancer cell death when ERb was inactivated either by co-incubation with its antagonist PTHPP (10 vs 70%) or human anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line transfected with ERb SiRNA (5 vs 70%) but not ERa SiRNA. In the latter cells, the expression of ERb was markedly suppressed (0 vs 70%).

Two studies were conducted in mammary gland to determine if consumption of soy products induces a gene expression profile similar to that of estradiol. In Experiment 1, Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 20/group) were fed AIN-93G diets with casein or SPI from PND30. From PND50-64, rats (N = 10/group) were ovariectomized and infused s.c. with 5 mg/kg/d 17b-estradiol (E2) to restore physiological levels. In Experiment 2, intact female rats were fed AIN-93G or SPI from PND21-33 or were additionally infused s.c. with 10 mg/kg/d E2 (N = 10/group). Mammary glands were collected and total mRNA isolated for microarray analysis. Array data were normalized using GeneSpring. Statistical analysis of genes expressed greater than 1.5-fold in Experiment 1 revealed 651 genes regulated by E2 (P< 0.05) compared to 27 genes regulated by SPI with only 6 in common between the two treatments. In Experiment 2, 391 genes were regulated by E2 (P<0.05) and 71 by SPI with only 17 genes in common. Data were confirmed by real time RT-PCR and suggest that gene signatures of E2 and SPI in the mammary gland have little overlap in either adults or prior to puberty. Sub-sets of 164 and 116 E2-regulated genes were significantly modulated by SPI feeding in the E2 + SPI vs. E2 + casein groups. There was little evidence of additive effects, and particularly in the adults, SPI feeding actually antagonized E2 actions. In Experiment 1, SPI feeding inhibited E2-mediated induction of cyclin D1, the oncogene c-myc, several c-myc regulated genes and E2 induction of ERb-specific genes, such as Knsl2 and Top2a. These data suggest that foods such as SPI, which are complex mixtures of proteins, peptides and many phytochemicals, are not estrogenic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 250mug/day of iodine intake during pregnancy and lactation, while the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends 220mug/day of iodine intake during pregnancy and 290mug/day during lactation. Seaweed in various preparations is an integral part of Korean food culture. In particular, the majority of Korean and many Korean-American women consume seaweed soup on a daily basis during the early postpartum period. Studies of the iodine content in the breast milk of Korean lactating mothers have demonstrated that iodine content in human milk correlates strongly with the frequency and quantity of seaweed soup consumption. However, the actual iodine content of this seaweed soup has not previously been reported.Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the average iodine content in traditional Korean seaweed soup. Methods: We selected 10 brands of commercially available dried seaweed purchased in the United States. 1oz of each brand was used to produce traditional Korean seaweed soup (1oz seaweed, 6cups water, beef, soy sauce, sesame oil). The iodine concentration of the dried seaweed and seaweed soup broths were measured spectrophotometrically. In total, the iodine concentrations of 10 samples of seaweed and 10 samples of seaweed soup broth were measured. Results: The average iodine content of the dried seaweed was 359+254 mug/gm. The average iodine content of seaweed broth was 1.95+0.8 mug/mL (mean+SD), with 1 bowl (240mL) of broth containing an average of at least 470+201 mug of iodine.Conclusion: Depending on quantity and frequency of seaweed soup intake, postpartum women who consume Korean seaweed soup may have daily iodine intakes and produce breastmilk that exceed the tolerable upper limit of daily intake as recommended by WHO (500mug/day for lactating women and >180 mug/day for infants).

Pregnant and lactating women are particularly susceptible to iodine deficiency, as developing infants rely solely on maternal iodine intake for thyroid hormone synthesis and normal neurodevelopment. The iodine status and thyroid function of U.S. vegetarians (users of plant-based diets, eggs, and milk; abstain from meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish) and vegans (non-consumers of all animal products) have not been previously studied. Exposures to two environmental inhibitors of thyroid iodine uptake, perchlorate (ClO4, present ubiquitously) and thiocyanate (SCN, a cigarette smoke metabolite and present in some foods) among vegetarians and vegans may additionally decrease available iodine and be associated with mild hypothyroidism. Methods: Urinary iodine, ClO4, SCN, and cotinine (a cigarette smoke-specific metabolite) and serum thyroid function were cross-sectionally measured in 141 Boston-area adults (78 vegetarians, 67% women, 30.8 [mean age] + 10.6 [SD] years, duration of diet: 11.3 + 11.7 years; and 63 vegans, 69% women, 36.6 + 13.2 years, duration of diet: 5.6 + 5.7 years). One vegan kelp-user was excluded due to an extremely elevated urinary iodine level. Subjects were also asked to estimate their ingestion of common iodine, SCN, and isoflavone (which may inhibit thyroid peroxidase)-containing foods. Results: Median urinary iodine concentration of vegans (78.5 mug/L; range, 6.8-964.7 mug/L) was lower than vegetarians (147.0 mug/L; 9.3-778.6 mug/L) (p<0.01). Urine cotinine revealed 6 recent smokers/group (>500 ng/mL). Median urinary SCN concentration of vegans (630 mug/L; 108-3085 mug/L) was higher than vegetarians (341 mug/L; 31-1963 mug/L) (p<0.01). Excluding the 12 smokers, this difference persisted (vegans: 576 mug/L, 108-2563 mug/L; vegetarians: 321 mug/L, 31-1698 mug/L; p<0.01). There were no between-group differences in urinary ClO4 levels (p=0.75), TSH (p=0.46), and FT4 (p=0.77). Urinary iodine, ClO4, and SCN levels were not associated with TSH (p=0.59) or FT4 (p=0.14), even when adjusted for age, gender, country of birth, diet type, diet compliance, salt type use, smoking, and isoflavone consumption. Conclusions: U.S. vegetarians are iodine sufficient. U.S. vegans may be at risk for low iodine intake, and vegan women of childbearing age should supplement with 150 mug iodine daily.

Tang","D-pinitol inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis","Numerous studies have indicated that inflammatory cytokines play a major role in osteoclastogenesis, leading to the bone resorption that is frequently associated with osteoporosis. d-pinitol, a 3-methoxy analogue of d-chiroinositol, was identified as an active principle in soy foods and legumes. Here we found that d-pinitol markedly inhibited the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastic differentiation from bone marrow stromal cells and RAW264.7 macrophage cells. In addition, d-pinitol also reduced RANKL-induced p38 and JNK phosphorylation. Furthermore, RANKL-mediated increase of IKK, IBalpha, and p65 phosphorylation and NF-B-luciferase activity was inhibited by d-pinitol. However, d-pinitol did not affect the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. In addition, d-pinitol also prevented the bone loss induced by ovariectomy in vivo. Our data suggest that d-pinitol inhibits osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow stromal cells and macrophage cells via attenuated RANKL-induced p38, JNK, and NF-B activation, which in turn protect bone loss from ovariectomy. 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Schenka","In vivo anti-tumoral effects of simvastatin in a cancer stem cell-rich model of breast carcinoma","Background: Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant neoplasm and the leading cause of death from malignancy among women worldwide. Dimetil-benz(a)anthracene (DMBA) is of the most frequently used carcinogenic substances in the literature, being highly efficient and specific for breast carcinoma induction. Preliminary data from our group indicate that DMBA induced neoplasia is highly enriched in cancer stem cells (CSC), one of the major targets of current drug development research. Simvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylgluraryl coenzyme A redutase (HMGCoA), widely used in primary and secondary prevention of hyperlipidemic-related cardiovascular diseases. Simvastatin has recently been associated to in vitro antiproliferation actions across a wide variety of malignant cell lines. Aim: this is the first study to report the antineoplastic effects of simvastatin on a DMBA-induced cancer stem cell-rich model of breast carcinoma. Design: Mammary tumor induction was performed by single gavage administration of DMBA (100mg/kg) in virgin female Sprague-Dawely. When the tumors reached approximately 1cm3, the animals were treated for 14 days with simvastatin (40mg/ kg/day in 1mL of soy oil, by gavage- Experimental Group, n=6) or with 1mL of soy (Control Group, n=6). After this 14-day protocol, the animals were euthanized and the tumors removed for macroscopic examination, volume measurement, histologic assessment and immunodetection of CSC markers (CD133 and Oct4). Results: The average tumor size of simvastatin treated animals (0.88+1.05cm3) was significantly (p<0.05) smaller than that of control rats (2.39+0.69 cm3). However, at this point, CD133 and Oct4 immunoexpressions were not significantly affected by the treatment with simvastatin. Specific modifications in the immunohistochemical techniques (with the inclusion of alternative antibody clones and additional markers) and in the quantitation protocols are under scrutiny in order to confirm the latter findings. Conclusions: These results indicate that simvastatin is effective in vivo as an antineoplastic agent in a model of breast carcinogenesis that favors the proliferation of cancer stem cells. Ongoing research in our laboratory is now focused on determining whether this antineoplastic action involves growth inhibition of cancer stem cells, more differentiated/committed neoplastic cells or both.",NA,"*United States *breast carcinoma *cancer stem cell *model *pathology female tumor feeding rat clone breast carcinogenesis laboratory growth inhibition tumor cell breast cancer malignant neoplastic disease cause of death human neoplasm drug development competitive inhibition secondary prevention cardiovascular disease in vitro study cancer cell cell line breast tumor carcinogenesis control group examination immunodetection tumor volume hyperlipidemia *simvastatin dimethylbenz[a]anthracene marker antibody antineoplastic agent carcinogen coenzyme A benz[a]anthracene soybean oil","465A","92","2012",-1

CSC are stem cell-like, what means they are poorly differentiated, highly aggressive. Chemotherapy works only in differentiated cells, not in CSC (Nature 2009). Fermented Soy has been shown to knock off resistance in cancer patients (1). We report a pilot trial with 18 patients in total, 7 breast-, 5 prostate-, 6 ovarian cancer patients, who were all treatment resistant to chemotherapy, receiving a fermented soy product(2). Fermented soy did knock off the treatment resistance. Investigation of gene expression of in the blood circulating CSC, before and after fermented soy consumption, did show tremendous changes in gene expression, like increase of tumor suppressor factors p21 and p53, also increase of Estrogen Receptor beta, NFkB, Myc C, Glucocorticoid receptor(3).

These Guidelines, published approximately every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and they reflect the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The ACS Guidelines focus on recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or creates barriers to healthy behaviors. Therefore, this committee presents recommendations for community action to accompany the 4 recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. These recommendations for community action recognize that a supportive social and physical environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors. The ACS Guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association for the prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.

Diederich","Targeting the wingless signaling pathway with natural compounds as chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents","The aberrant activation of the wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway is a key element involved in carcinogenesis as Wnt regulates a variety of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis and cell motility. Upon Wnt receptor activation, the canonical ""Wnt/beta-catenin"" as well as the non canonical ""Wnt/planar cell polarity, Wnt/Ca2+"" pathways are activated. This offers multiple possibilities to target the aberrant regulation of this signaling pathway in order to counteract cancer proliferation. During the last decade, natural compounds from both marine and terrestrial origins were tested for their potential to modulate the expression of specific genes related to the Wnt signaling cascade but also for their anti-carcinogenic properties. It appears that phenolic compounds (e.g., caffeic acid phenethyl ester, curcumin and derivatives, green, white and black tea, resveratrol, quercetin, isoflavone, fisetin, and isoflavone) as well as other small molecules were able to inhibit the Wnt signaling through the modulation of beta-catenin expression, transcriptional activity and of the subsequent expression of Wnt target genes. Altogether, these findings underline the fact that Wnt signaling could be considered as a promising target for innovative strategies for cancer treatment and prevention. 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"actin filament *antineoplastic activity apoptosis article berry breast cancer calcium signaling carcinogenesis cell adhesion cell cycle arrest cell differentiation cell membrane cell polarity cell proliferation cell survival *chemoprophylaxis colon carcinogenesis colon carcinoma colorectal tumor Curcuma longa drug mechanism drug structure enzyme activity familial polyposis gene expression genetic transcription Herba Epimedii human medicinal plant molecularly targeted therapy *neoplasm nonhuman osteosarcoma protein binding protein phosphorylation protein targeting *signal transduction tea transcription regulation anthocyanin/pd [Pharmacology] *antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] black tea extract/pd [Pharmacology] caffeic acid/pd [Pharmacology] caffeic acid phenethyl ester/pd [Pharmacology] coumaric acid/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] demethoxycurcumin/pd [Pharmacology] didemethoxycurcumin/pd [Pharmacology] ellagic acid/pd [Pharmacology] ellagitannin/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] ferulic acid/pd [Pharmacology] fisetin/pd [Pharmacology] flavanone/pd [Pharmacology] flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] green tea extract/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxybenzoic acid/pd [Pharmacology] ionomycin/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] lupeol/pd [Pharmacology] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] *phenol derivative/pd [Pharmacology] pkf 222 815/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] tetrahydrocurcumin/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug *Wnt1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","245-254","13","2012",-1

In addition, dietary phytochemicals also synergize with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

To examine the prostate cancer risk based on isoflavone intake and equol production, we carried out a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral isoflavone (60mg/day) for 12months. The inclusion criteria were Japanese men between 50 and 75years of age, a serum prostate-specific antigen level of 2.5-10.0ng/mL, and a single, negative prostate biopsy within 12months prior to enrollment. The study included 158 men in eight Japanese centers. Their median age was 66.0years, and the numbers of equol producers and non-producers were 76 (48%) and 82 (52%), respectively. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and the scheduled intake of tablets was completed by 153 patients (96.8%). The prostate-specific antigen value showed no significant difference before and after treatment. Of the 89 patients evaluated by central pathological review, the incidence of biopsy-detectable prostate cancer in the isoflavone and placebo groups showed no significant difference (21.4%vs 34.0%, P=0.140). However, for the 53 patients aged 65years or more, the incidence of cancer in the isoflavone group was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (28.0%vs 57.1%, P=0.031).

Several therapeutic agents are now available to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis and prevent fractures. Combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduce the relative risk of non-vertebral fractures by about 18%. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should not be prescribed for osteoporosis in women who do not experience menopausal symptoms. The marked benefits of raloxifene on the reduction in invasive breast cancer and vertebral fracture risk are partially counterbalanced by a lack of effect on non-vertebral fracture risk, and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and stroke. All four bisphosphonates available in Belgium, except ibandronate, have been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures in prospective, placebo-controlled trials. Globally, the incidence of vertebral fractures is reduced by 41%-70%, and the incidence of non-vertebral fractures by 25%-39%. The antifracture efficacy of weekly or monthly doses of oral bisphosphonates has not been directly shown but is assumed from bridging studies based on BMD changes. To date, the various bisphosphonates have not been studied in head-to-head comparative trials with fracture endpoints. There are potential concerns that long-term suppression of bone turnover associated with bisphosphonate treatment may eventually lead to adverse effects, especially atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw, but these cases are extremely rare. Teriparatide (recombinant human 1-34 PTH) administered by daily subcutaneous injections decreases by 65% the relative risk of new vertebral fractures in patients with severe osteoporosis. Pivotal trials with strontium ranelate have shown a 41% reduction in new vertebral fractures and a 16% reduction in non-vertebral fractures over 3 years. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANK Ligand that is administered as a 60-mg subcutaneous injection every 6 months. In the pivotal phase III trial, there was a 68% reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures, whereas the incidence of non-vertebral fractures was reduced by 20%. Several new approaches are being explored, including antibodies to sclerostin, cathepsin K inhibitors, src kinase inhibitors, and drugs that act on calcium sensing receptors.",NA,"bone density bone turnover cardiovascular disease conference paper dietary intake dizziness/si [Side Effect] headache/si [Side Effect] hip fracture/dt [Drug Therapy] hormone substitution human hyperparathyroidism ischemic heart disease nausea/si [Side Effect] osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] postmenopause *postmenopause osteoporosis stroke venous thromboembolism vertebra fracture/dt [Drug Therapy] alendronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] alendronic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration] bazedoxifene/cb [Drug Combination] bazedoxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/po [Oral Drug Administration] bisphosphonic acid derivative/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] calcium/cb [Drug Combination] ibandronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] ibandronic acid/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] ibandronic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration] lasofoxifene parathyroid hormone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] parathyroid hormone/ct [Clinical Trial] phytoestrogen/cb [Drug Combination] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo raloxifene risedronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] risedronic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration] strontium ranelate/pd [Pharmacology] vitamin D/cb [Drug Combination] zoledronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] zoledronic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration]","443-447","66","2011",-1

Oncoplastic surgery and partial-breast reconstruction have already developed to improve cosmetic outcomes. However, new strategies for breast diseases are still needed. The principles of evolutionary biology and phylogeny can help solve specific medical problems. But the phylogeny of human breast areola had not been researched ever since proposed. The breast areola has a unique phylogeny, it has all different types of skin glands and includes a few hairs towards the periphery. These skin appendages, including Montgomery's glands - whose miniature mammary acini are in the subcutaneous tissue - make the dermal microvascular "" sink"" phenomenon imperfect, resulting in that more drug molecules can penetrate into deeper tissue. Meanwhile, the wrinkled skin of the areola increases the total delivery area. Here, we emphasize that the human breast areola has the potential to increase transdermal drug delivery to the breast. We anticipate that our hypothesis may help to provide new, optimized therapeutic and prophylactic strategies for the human breast diseases. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",NA,"article biology breast areola *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/su [Surgery] breast reconstruction cancer surgery *drug delivery system human mammary gland mastectomy phylogeny risk skin appendage skin gland subcutaneous tissue *transareolar drug delivery treatment outcome afimoxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] afimoxifene/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] alpha lactalbumin/dt [Drug Therapy] alpha lactalbumin/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] anastrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] anastrozole/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] anthracycline/dt [Drug Therapy] anthracycline/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] antibiotic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] antibiotic agent/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] coumestan/dt [Drug Therapy] coumestan/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] exemestane/dt [Drug Therapy] exemestane/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] flavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] flavone derivative/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] fluorouracil/dt [Drug Therapy] fluorouracil/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] letrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] letrozole/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] pertuzumab/dt [Drug Therapy] pertuzumab/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] primrose oil/dt [Drug Therapy] primrose oil/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] progesterone/dt [Drug Therapy] progesterone/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] taxane derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] taxane derivative/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] trastuzumab/dt [Drug Therapy] trastuzumab/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] unclassified drug","4-6","78","2012",-1

In this study, we investigated a role for TH signaling in n-3 PUFA effects. Euthyroid and hypothyroid adult rats (methimazole-treated for 5 weeks) received FO or soybean oil (control) by oral administration for 3 weeks. In euthyroid rats, FO treatment reduced serum triglycerides and cholesterol, diminished body fat, and increased protein content of the animals. In addition, FO-treated rats exhibited higher liver expression of TRbeta1 and mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (mGPD), at protein and mRNA levels, but no alteration of glutathione S-transferase or type 1 deiodinase. In hypothyroid condition, FO induced reduction in serum cholesterol and increase in body protein content, but lost the ability to reduce triglycerides and body fat, and to induce TRbeta1 and mGDP expression. FO did not change PPARalpha liver abundance regardless of thyroid state; however, hypothyroidism led to a marked increase in PPARalpha liver content but did not alter TRbeta1 or TRa expression. The data suggest that part of the effect of n-3 PUFA from FO on lipid metabolism is dependent on TH signaling in specific steps and together with the marked upregulation of PPARalpha in liver of hypothyroid rats suggest important in vivo consequences of the cross-talking between those fatty acids and TH pathways in liver metabolism. 2011 Society for Endocrinology.",NA,"animal experiment article body fat cholesterol blood level controlled study *hypolipemia *hypothyroidism in vivo study lipid metabolism liver metabolism male mitochondrion nonhuman priority journal protein content protein expression rat receptor upregulation triacylglycerol blood level cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] fish oil glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] liotrix messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *omega 3 fatty acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] thiamazole *thyroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","65-72","211","2011",-1

We have earlier reported that the increased intake of soy isoflavones reduces risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, and experimental studies suggest that dietary isoflavones can down-regulate the expression of the MDM2 oncoprotein. In this study, we investigated the association between the MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P polymorphisms and breast cancer risk using a case-control study of 403 cases and 662 controls nested among 35,303 women in The Singapore Chinese Health Study, a population-based, prospective cohort of middle-aged and elderly men and women who have been continuously followed since 1993. The G allele of the TP53 R72P polymorphism and T allele of the MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism were putative high-risk alleles and exhibited a combined gene-dose-dependent joint effect on breast cancer risk that was more clearly observed in postmenopausal women. Among postmenopausal women, the simultaneous presence of G allele in TP53 and T allele in MDM2 polymorphisms was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.42 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-5.50]. Furthermore, the protective effect of dietary soy isoflavones on postmenopausal breast cancer was mainly confined to women homozygous for the high activity MDM2 allele (GG genotype). In this genetic subgroup, women consuming levels of soy isoflavones above the median level exhibited risk that was half of those with below median intake (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.28-0.99). Our findings support experimental data implicating combined effects of MDM2 protein and the p53-mediated pathway in breast carcinogenesis, and suggest that soy isoflavones may exert protective effect via down-regulation of the MDM2 protein. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"adult aged allele article *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer prevention *cancer risk Chinese cohort analysis controlled study down regulation female food intake gene activity gene dosage genetic association genetic risk genotype high risk patient homozygote human human cell major clinical study male *oncogene *oncogene mdm2 population based case control study postmenopause priority journal prospective study risk reduction Singapore *single nucleotide polymorphism *tumor suppressor gene *arginine/ec [Endogenous Compound] guanine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone derivative *proline/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein MDM2/ec [Endogenous Compound] thymine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1011-1019","130","2011",-1

Crowe","The role of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal cells","Background and aims: Active efflux proteins such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) are thought to have a protective role in the intestinal tract by preventing xenotoxin absorption. Some bacteria also need to adhere to the intestinal tract before causing disease through adhesin secretion. Thus, this study was initiated to examine whether any association exists between bacterial adhesion. Methods: Three human cell lines (Caco2, RKO, and MCF7), and 6 species of bacteria were used in this study (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium sporogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Following incubation of our cells with active efflux inhibitors, bacteria incubated with a stable fluorescent dye were co-incubated at 37 degreeC for various times up to 240. min. Fluorescence intensity was used to compare bacterial attachment to these cell lines with either normal efflux protein expression or with induction or inhibition of efflux proteins. Results: P-gp inhibition by either PSC-833 or GF120918 resulted in a significant increase of all bacterial attachment to Caco2 cells up to 3 fold. RKO cells and MCF7 cells did not alter their bacterial attachment with PSC-833. Fumitremorgen C, a dedicated BCRP inhibitor had no effect. In addition, rifampicin, a P-gp inducer, resulted in some limited reduction in Salmonella and Klebsiella attachment only. Conclusions: These results indicate P-gp expression may contribute to the resistance of potential bacterial toxicity, by preventing them adhering to human enterocytes cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which may reduce the risk or intensity of gastrointestinal disorders. 2011.",NA,"antibacterial activity article bacterial strain *bacterium adherence *cell adhesion cell strain CACO 2 cell strain MCF 7 Clostridium sporogenes controlled study Escherichia coli fluorescence microscopy *gastrointestinal tract growth inhibition human human cell incubation time *intestine cell Klebsiella pneumoniae priority journal protein expression protein function protein induction Pseudomonas aeruginosa room temperature Salmonella typhimurium Staphylococcus aureus *breast cancer resistance protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] carbamazepine/pd [Pharmacology] efflux protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] elacridar/pd [Pharmacology] fluorescent dye fumitremorgen C/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glibenclamide/pd [Pharmacology] glycoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *glycoprotein P/ec [Endogenous Compound] methylprednisolone/pd [Pharmacology] probenecid/pd [Pharmacology] progesterone/pd [Pharmacology] protein inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] rifampicin/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug valspodar/pd [Pharmacology] verlukast/pd [Pharmacology]","531-542","5","2011",-1

Albini","Diet-derived phytochemicals: From cancer chemoprevention to cardio-oncological prevention","Cardiovascular diseases and cancer are the leading causes of death in most countries. These diseases share many common risk factors as well as pathogenetic determinants, and their incidence is related to age in an exponential manner. Furthermore, it has become apparent that several treatments used in therapy or even in prevention of cancer can impair the structural and functional integrity of the cardiovascular system, giving rise to an interdisciplinary field: cardiooncology. However, tumors and cardiovascular diseases also share common protective factors: they can be prevented either by avoiding exposure to recognized risk factors, and/or by favoring the intake of protective compounds and by modulating the host defense machinery. These latter approaches are generally known as chemoprevention. A great variety of dietary and pharmacological agents have been shown to be potentially capable of preventing cancer in preclinical models, most of which are of plant origin. Phytochemicals, in particular diet-derived compounds, have therefore been proposed and applied in clinical trials as cancer chemopreventive agents. There is now increasing evidence that some phytochemicals can be also protective for the heart, having the potential to reduce cancer, cardiovascular disease and even anticancer drug-induced cardiotoxicity. We introduce the concept that these compounds induce pre-conditioning, a low level cellular stress that induces strong protective mechanisms conferring resistance to toxins such as cancer chemotherapeutics. Cancer cells and cardiomyocytes have fundamental differences in their metabolism and sensitivity to preconditioning, autophagy and apoptosis, so that dosage of the prevention compounds is important. Here we discuss the mechanisms responsible for the cardiotoxicity of anticancer drugs, the possibility to prevent them and provide examples of diet-derived phytochemicals and other biological substances that could be exploited for protecting the cardiovascular system according to a joint cardio-oncological preventative approach. 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"antiinflammatory activity apoptosis article atrioventricular block/si [Side Effect] autophagy breast cancer/pc [Prevention] caloric intake cancer adjuvant therapy cancer incidence cancer invasion cancer mortality *cancer prevention cancer risk carcinogenesis cardiotoxicity/dt [Drug Therapy] cardiotoxicity/pc [Prevention] cardiotoxicity/si [Side Effect] cardiovascular risk cause of death cell stress *chemoprophylaxis colon cancer/pc [Prevention] *diet DNA damage drug efficacy drug induced disease/dt [Drug Therapy] drug mechanism drug megadose drug safety fibrosis/si [Side Effect] glucose blood level heart arrhythmia/si [Side Effect] *heart disease/pc [Prevention] heart failure/dt [Drug Therapy] heart infarction prevention heart muscle cell heart ventricle tachycardia/si [Side Effect] human hypertension/si [Side Effect] irradiation low drug dose metabolic syndrome X metastasis *neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy] *neoplasm/pc [Prevention] nonhuman nutrition oxidative stress phase 1 clinical trial (topic) phase 2 clinical trial (topic) prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] side effect/si [Side Effect] sinus bradycardia/si [Side Effect] thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] triacylglycerol blood level tumor growth 7 monohydroxyetylrutoside/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] anthocyanin/an [Drug Analysis] anthocyanin/pd [Pharmacology] anthracycline antibiotic agent/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *antineoplastic agent/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *antineoplastic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] calceolarioside/an [Drug Analysis] calceolarioside/pd [Pharmacology] capecitabine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] cruceriferous/an [Drug Analysis] cruceriferous/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/an [Drug Analysis] curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] cyclophosphamide/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] cytarabine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] doxorubicin/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] doxorubicin/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] doxorubicin/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] fluorouracil/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] genistein/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] glucoraphanin/an [Drug Analysis] glucoraphanin/pd [Pharmacology] grape seed extract/an [Drug Analysis] grape seed extract/pd [Pharmacology] melatonin/an [Drug Analysis] melatonin/dt [Drug Therapy] melatonin/pd [Pharmacology] naringenin/an [Drug Analysis] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] organosulfur derivative/an [Drug Analysis] organosulfur derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] organosulfur derivative/pd [Pharmacology] paclitaxel/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *plant medicinal product/an [Drug Analysis] *plant medicinal product/dt [Drug Therapy] *plant medicinal product/pd [Pharmacology] protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] pycnogenol/an [Drug Analysis] pycnogenol/pd [Pharmacology] resveratrol/an [Drug Analysis] resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] selective estrogen receptor modulator/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] sulforaphane/an [Drug Analysis] sulforaphane/pd [Pharmacology] thioctic acid/an [Drug Analysis] thioctic acid/pd [Pharmacology] ubidecarenone/an [Drug Analysis] ubidecarenone/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug Vinca alkaloid/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction]","1909-1924","12","2011",-1

Due to their estrogenic activity, isoflavones are a focus of safety concerns about their potential to promote the growth of hormone-dependent cancer cells. In this study, isoflavones and plant extracts were tested for their effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest. Isoflavones and plant extracts were applied in proliferation assays on 11 human cancer cell lines (representing cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, cervix, liver, pancreas, stomach and ovaries) and a fibroblast line to detect cytotoxic activity. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to detect the induction of apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. Isoflavones and plant extracts significantly reduced the proliferation activity of the treated cancer cell lines. Growth promotion was not observed, but apoptosis or necrosis induction was, as was cell cycle arrest, with genistein as the most potent isoflavone. Isoflavones and plant extracts from soy and red clover, respectively, do not promote the growth of human cancer cells but induce decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

Red clover (RC) isoflavones inhibits transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-induced androgenicity. Mechanisms controlling those activities were explored. Three hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs), 3beta-HSD, HSD-17beta1 and HSD-17beta5 involved in metabolizing DHEA to testosterone (TESTO) were investigated. Individual depletion of HSDs in 6S cells significantly reduced TGF-beta1/DHEA-induced PSA in LAPC-4 cells in cocultures. Monomer amounts of 3beta-HSD were similar without or with TGF-beta1 in both cell types but aggregates of 3beta-HSD in 6S cells were much higher than those in LAPC-4 cells and were upregulated by TGFbeta in 6S cells. Basal and TGF-beta1-treated levels of HSD-17beta1 and HSD-17beta5 in LAPC-4 cells were significantly lower than in 6S cells, whereas levels of HSD-17beta1 but not HSD-17beta5 were TGFbeta inducible. 6S cell HSD genes expression induced by TGFbeta or androgen signaling was insignificant to contribute TGF-beta1/DHEA-upregulated protein levels of HSDs. RC decreased TGF-beta1- upregulation of aggregates of 3beta-HSD but not HSD-17beta1. Depletion of TGFbeta receptors (TGFbeta Rs) reduced TGF-beta1/DHEA-upregulated HSDs and TESTO. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that TGF-beta1 disrupted associations of TGFbeta Rs/HSDs aggregates, whereas RC suppressed the dissociations of aggregates of 3beta-HSD but not HSD-17beta1 from the receptors. Given that TGFbeta Rs are recycled with or without ligand, TGF-beta1-induced disassociation of the HSDs from TGFbeta Rs may increase stability and activity of the HSDs.

Soy products are able to affect PSA kinetics in some men with prostate cancer, and this effect has been attributed to the decreased expression of the androgen receptor and other mechanisms. METHODS:: We treated 10 men with rising PSA levels after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy with commercially available soy products. Scans revealed no gross metastatic disease. Three men also had been receiving androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and had rising PSA levels that were consistent with castration-resistant (CR) disease. We reported the results of this modality on PSA levels, PSA kinetics, and the duration of PSA response. RESULTS:: Responses occurred in 4 of 7 (57%) patients with ADT-naive disease and 1 of 3 (33%) patients with CR disease. The median duration of treatment response was 24 months. The overall clinical benefit, therefore, was noted in 5 of 10 (50%) patients. Therapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS:: Our findings are fairly congruent with what has been described in the literature on the use of this modality in prostate cancer. We used commercially available soy products.

Jamieson","Clinical potential of microRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma","Objectives: Aggressive invasion and early metastases are characteristic features of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). More than 90% of patients have surgically nonresectable disease at presentation. Despite increasing knowledge of the genetics of this complex disease, systemic therapies, particularly gemcitabine, have modest clinical benefit and marginal survival advantage. MicroRNAs have been shown to have a role in oncogenesis, invasion, and metastases via epigenetic posttranscriptional gene regulation. Our objective was to discuss the clinical impact of microRNAs within PDAC. Methods: This review details the understanding of microRNAs to date and explores the clinical utility of microRNAs in PDAC. Results: Recent studies have focused on the impact of microRNA expression in PDAC, many of which have shown the diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic utility of microRNA profiling in PDAC identifying numerous potential targets including miR-21, miR-196a, and miR-217. Conclusions: MicroRNA stability in body fluid and tissue samples makes this area one of the most promising for earlier detection of PDAC. Indeed, microRNAs may in the future serve as a long-awaited screening tool for PDAC. Furthermore, microRNA expression profiling in PDAC may be incorporated into modern treatment algorithms to enhance therapeutic management.

But their molecular mechanisms of action are largely unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of genistein and quercetin on proliferation and apoptosis in HER2-expressing breast cancer cells. Materials and Methods: The antiproliferative effects of phytoestrogens were tested by proliferation assays. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the cell cycle. The effect of phytoestrogens on cell-signaling molecules was determined by Western blotting. Results: Genistein and quercetin inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 vec and MCF-7 HER2 cells. This growth inhibition was accompanied with an increase of subG0/G1 apoptotic fractions. Genistein and quercetin induced extrinsic apoptosis pathway, up-regulating p53. Genistein and quercetin reduced the phosphorylation level of IBalpha, and abrogated the nuclear translocation of p65 and its phosphorylation within the nucleus.

Yim","Identification of a natural compound by cell-based screening that enhances interferon regulatory factor-1 activity and causes tumor suppression","The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is induced by many tumor-suppressive stimuli and can mediate antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in cancer cells. Thus, identifying agents that enhance IRF-1 activity may be an effective approach to cancer therapy. A cell-based screening assay was developed to identify extracts and compounds that could enhance IRF-1 activity, using an IRF-1-dependent luciferase reporter cell line. Through this approach, we identified a natural product extract and a known active component of this extract, baicalein, which causes a marked increase in IRF-1-dependent reporter gene expression and IRF-1 protein, with modulation of known IRF-1 targets PUMA and cyclin D1. Baicalein causes suppression of growth in vitro in multiple cancer cell lines in the low micromolar range. IRF-1 plays a role in this growth suppression as shown by significant resistance to growth suppression in a breast cancer cell line stably transfected with short hairpin RNA against IRF-1. Finally, intraperitoneal administration of baicalein by repeated injection causes inhibition of growth in both xenogeneic and syngeneic mouse models of cancer without toxicity to the animals. These findings indicate that identifying enhancers of IRF-1 activity may have utility in anticancer therapies and that cell-based screening for activation of transcription factors can be a useful approach for drug discovery. 2011 AACR.",NA,"animal cell animal model article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer cell culture *cancer inhibition cell assay controlled study drug screening drug toxicity female gene expression genetic transfection human human cell in vitro study modulation mouse nonhuman priority journal randomized controlled trial reporter gene transgenic mouse tumor growth 3 (4,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide *baicalein/dv [Drug Development] *baicalein/dt [Drug Therapy] *baicalein/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *baicalein/pd [Pharmacology] cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *interferon regulatory factor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] PUMA protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] short hairpin RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1774-1783","10","2011",-1

Dietary lignans are metabolized to enterolignans, which are subsequently absorbed and become bioavailable. Patients and Methods: We assessed the prognosis of 1,140 postmenopausal patients with breast cancer age 50 to 74 years who were diagnosed between 2002 and 2005. Vital status through the end of 2009 was ascertained via local population registries, and deaths were verified by death certificates. Information on recurrences and secondary tumors was verified by clinical records and attending physicians. Associations of postdiagnostic serum enterolactone (a biomarker for dietary lignans) with overall survival and distant disease-free survival were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age at diagnosis and adjusted for prognostic factors. Results: Median enterolactone levels for deceased patients and those still alive were 17.0 and 21.4 nmol/L, respectively. During a median of 6.1 years of follow-up after diagnosis, 162 deaths were confirmed. Higher serum enterolactone levels were associated with significantly reduced hazard ratios (HRs) for death (HR per 10 nmol/L increment, 0.94; P = .04; HR for the highest quartile, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.99). For distant disease, HR was 0.94 per 10 nmol/L increment (P = .08) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.35 to 1.09) for the highest quartile. The highest quartile of serum enterolactone was associated with a significantly reduced risk of death only for estrogen receptor-negative tumors (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.87) but not for estrogen receptor-positive tumors (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.84: P for heterogeneity = .09).

Thus, designing potent and selective Src kinase inhibitors as anticancer agents is a subject of major interest. A series of 4-aryl substituted derivatives of 2-amino-7-dimethylamino-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile were synthesized using one-pot reaction of appropriate substituted aromatic aldehydes, malononitrile, and 3-(dimethylamino)phenol in the presence of piperidine. All 23 compounds were evaluated for inhibition of Src kinase and cell proliferation in human colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) and leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cell lines. Among the tested compounds, 2-chlorophenyl-(4c), 3-nitrophenyl-(4h), 4-trifluoromethyphenyl-(4i), and 2,3-dichlorophenyl-(4k) substituted chromenes showed Src kinase inhibitory effect with IC50 values of 11.1-18.3 muM. Compound 4c was relatively selective against Src (IC50 = 11.1 muM), when compared with selected kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, IC50 > 300 muM), C-terminal Src kinase (Csk, IC50 = 101.7 muM), and lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck, IC50 = 46.8 muM). 3-Chlorophenyl substituted thiazole (4v) and 2-chlorophenylsubstituted thiazole (4u) chromene derivatives inhibited the cell proliferation of HT-29 and CCRF-CEM by 80% and 50%, respectively, at a concentration of 50 muM.

A 4 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments comprising 4 dietary DTP levels (0, 8, 16 and 24%) with and without enzyme supplementation was used. Each diet was fed to 4 replicates pens of 8 broiler chicks from 1 to 42 days posthatch as a coarse mash. The addition of DTP up to 16% to broiler diets did not significantly affect feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) during starter (1 to 21 days), growing (22 to 42 days) and entire experimental (1 to 42 days) periods. Inclusion of 24% DTP into the diet significantly decreased FI at starter and entire experimental periods. Also, inclusion of 24% DTP into the diets significantly decreased BWG and increased FCR at all periods. Birds fed the diets supplemented with Rovabio Excel had significantly higher BWG during the starter and entire experimental periods. No significant effect of enzyme addition was observed on FI and FCR. The dietary treatments with or without enzyme did not significantly affect mortality. The 8% DTP-fed group had comparable carcass weight, carcass yield, yield of breast, thigh, abdominal fat, heart, liver and gizzard with those of control group. The higher levels of DTP significantly decreased carcass weight and yield, yield of breast and thigh when compared to the control group. Enzyme supplementation significantly increased carcass weight and yield of abdominal fat. No significant interactions between the DTP and enzyme were observed for performance parameters and carcass characteristics. These results demonstrate that supplementation of DTP up to 8% to broiler diets had no significant adverse effects on performance parameters and carcass characteristics.

Sarkar","Over-expression of FoxM1 leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell phenotype in pancreatic cancer cells","FoxM1 is known to play important role in the development and progression of many malignancies including pancreatic cancer. Studies have shown that the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and induction of cancer stem cell (CSC) or cancer stem-like cell phenotypes are highly inter-related, and contributes to drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and metastasis. The molecular mechanism(s) by which FoxM1 contributes to the acquisition of EMT phenotype and induction of CSC self-renewal capacity is poorly understood. Therefore, we established FoxM1 over-expressing pancreatic cancer (AsPC-1) cells, which showed increased cell growth, clonogenicity, and cell migration. Moreover, over-expression of FoxM1 led to the acquisition of EMT phenotype by activation of mesenchymal cell markers, ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail2, E-cadherin, and vimentin, which is consistent with increased sphere-forming (pancreatospheres) capacity and expression of CSC surface markers (CD44 and EpCAM). We also found that over-expression of FoxM1 led to decreased expression of miRNAs (let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, miR-200b, and miR-200c); however, re-expression of miR-200b inhibited the expression of ZEB1, ZEB2, vimentin as well as FoxM1, and induced the expression of E-cadherin, leading to the reversal of EMT phenotype. Finally, we found that genistein, a natural chemo-preventive agent, inhibited cell growth, clonogenicity, cell migration and invasion, EMT phenotype, and formation of pancreatospheres consistent with reduced expression of CD44 and EpCAM. These results suggest, for the first time, that FoxM1 over-expression is responsible for the acquisition of EMT and CSC phenotype, which is in part mediated through the regulation of miR-200b and these processes, could be easily attenuated by genistein.

"865","774"," O. Zierau, K. A. Power","Lifelong and prenatal effects of phytoestrogens","Molecular and cellular effects of lifelong or even multigenerational exposure of phytoestrogens (PEs) are still controversially discussed and gain substantial public attention. While PE-rich diets may be preventive towards menopausal complications as well towards hormone dependent cancer formation, it seems as if late PE exposure at an advanced age results in increased risk of hormonal carcinogenesis in certain animal studies. Long-term epidemiological studies imply a protective effect of PEs on breast tissue as indicated by reduced rates of breast cancer in countries with high consumption of PE-rich soy products, as in Southeast Asia. Although, it is still speculative if the biological effects of soy products derive only from the contained PE. It is known for a number of endocrine modulating substances that the timing of exposure is a crucial element of its final effects. Therefore, exposure during critical developmental windows, such as the embryonal or fetal, the early postnatal and pubertal period, is most likely to have an important impact and result in longest-lasting effects. Thus, these effects may not only result from direct exposure to specific tissues but also by germline modifications. In summary, a number of new studies demonstrate that lifelong PE exposure is able to affect estrogen sensitive tissues, apparently in a tissue selective manner, effects which differ from later life exposure. With respect to health risks and benefits, these data indicates that the situation is much more complex then expected, and these results are highly relevant for the interpretation of regional differences in endocrine-related cancer incidence. 2011 Bentham Science Publishers.",NA,"aging article *breast cancer/et [Etiology] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer prevention dietary intake drug activity embryo development estrogen activity fetus development germ line health hazard hormonal carcinogenesis hormonal regulation human menopausal syndrome nonhuman postnatal development priority journal puberty Southeast Asia soybean daidzein/cm [Drug Comparison] daidzein/dv [Drug Development] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/dv [Drug Development] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] isoflavone derivative/dv [Drug Development] isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] lignan derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] lignan derivative/dv [Drug Development] lignan derivative/pd [Pharmacology] matairesinol/cm [Drug Comparison] matairesinol/dv [Drug Development] matairesinol/pd [Pharmacology] *phytoestrogen/dv [Drug Development] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] secoisolariciresinol/cm [Drug Comparison] secoisolariciresinol/dv [Drug Development] secoisolariciresinol/pd [Pharmacology]","172-179","7","2011",-1

Di Pietro","Targeting the multidrug ABCG2 transporter with flavonoidic inhibitors: In Vitro optimization and in vivo validation","This review describes the breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2 through its structure, functional roles and involvement in cell multidrug resistance, especially in cancer cells resistance to chemotherapeutics. The different types of known inhibitors are described, some being non-selective, since they also bind to other targets, and others being quite specific such as flavonoids. The different classes of active flavonoids and other polyphenols are described, some as plant natural compounds, but most of them being prepared and derivatized through medicinal chemistry. Quantitative structure-activity relationships of the ability of flavones, chalcones, xanthones, acridones and various benzopyrane/benzofurane derivatives to inhibit ABCG2-mediated drug efflux have led to pharmacophores and molecular models allowing to optimize the available hit compounds and to design new-generation lead compounds. Interestingly, inhibitory flavonoids are quite specific for ABCG2 versus ABCB1 and ABCC1, and appear either non-competitive or partially competitive towards mitoxantrone efflux. Most compounds do not inhibit ATPase activity, and are assumed not to be transported themselves by the transporter. Some acridones, firstly optimized in vitro as potent inhibitors, are indeed efficient in vivo, against human xenografts in SCID mice, more efficiently than gefitinib taken as a control. Future developments should open the way to more efficient/targeted modulators including (i) the potential interest of bimodulation by combining two different inhibitors, (ii) computer-assisted ligand-based drug design for getting more potent and more specific inhibitors, (iii) structure-based drug design from ABCG2 molecular models allowing in silico screening and docking of new inhibitors. 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"computer model conference paper drug design drug potentiation drug targeting enzyme activity human in vitro study in vivo study nonhuman quantitative structure activity relation validation study 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a octahydro 6 isobutyl 9 methoxy 1,4 dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4 b]indole 3 propanoic acid tert butyl ester/it [Drug Interaction] 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12a octahydro 6 isobutyl 9 methoxy 1,4 dioxopyrazino[1',2':1,6]pyrido[3,4 b]indole 3 propanoic acid tert butyl ester/pd [Pharmacology] 3',4',7 trimethoxyflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 3',4',7 trimethoxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] 5,7 dimethoxyflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 5,7 dimethoxyflavone/dv [Drug Development] 5,7 dimethoxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] 6 prenylchrysin/an [Drug Analysis] 6 prenylchrysin/dv [Drug Development] 6 prenylchrysin/pd [Pharmacology] 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin/pd [Pharmacology] 8 methylflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 8 methylflavone/dv [Drug Development] 8 methylflavone/pd [Pharmacology] 8 prenylchrysin/an [Drug Analysis] 8 prenylchrysin/dv [Drug Development] 8 prenylchrysin/pd [Pharmacology] *antineoplastic agent biochanin A/an [Drug Analysis] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] boeravinone g/pd [Pharmacology] *breast cancer resistance protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *breast cancer resistance protein inhibitor canertinib/pd [Pharmacology] cannabidiol/pd [Pharmacology] cannabinol/pd [Pharmacology] chrysin/an [Drug Analysis] chrysin/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] dronabinol/pd [Pharmacology] elacridar/an [Drug Analysis] elacridar/dv [Drug Development] elacridar/pd [Pharmacology] fumitremorgin C/pd [Pharmacology] imatinib/pd [Pharmacology] isokaempferide/pd [Pharmacology] multidrug resistance protein 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] novobiocin/it [Drug Interaction] novobiocin/pd [Pharmacology] piperazinedione/pd [Pharmacology] tariquidar/pd [Pharmacology] tectochrysin/an [Drug Analysis] tectochrysin/pd [Pharmacology] topotecan/it [Drug Interaction] topotecan/pd [Pharmacology] tryprostatin a/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug","3387-3401","18","2011",-1

BBI can resist both acidic conditions and the action of proteolytic enzymes, and transit through the stomach and small intestine without major degradation, permitting significant amounts to reach the large intestine in active form to exert their reported anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. These potential pharmacological benefits have been linked recently to the intrinsic ability of BBI to inhibit serine proteases, and the data suggest that both trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like proteases involved in carcinogenesis should be considered as potential targets of BBI. However, the therapeutic targets and the action mechanisms of BBI remain unknown. Their elucidation will provide insights into the properties of these plant protease inhibitors as colorectal chemopreventive agents, providing a strong base for the development of legume crops and their products as pro-nutritional, health-promoting food. The deployment of modern genomic tools and genome sequence information are underpinning studies of natural and induced polymorphism in BBI.

It has long been established that distinct glycan structures are associated with specific forms of cancer, but far less is known about the complete array of glycans associated with certain tumors. The cancer glycome has great potential as a source of biomarkers, but progress in this field has been hindered by a lack of available techniques for the elucidation of disease-associated glycosylation. In the present study, lectin microarrays consisting of 45 lectins with different binding preferences covering N-and O-linked glycans were coupled with evanescent-field activated fluorescent detection in the glycomic analysis of primary breast tumors and the serum and urine of patients with metastatic breast cancer. A single 50 m section of a primary breast tumor or <1 L of breast cancer patient serum or urine was sufficient to detect glycosylation alterations associated with metastatic breast cancer, as inferred from lectin-binding patterns. The high-throughput, sensitive and relatively simple nature of the simultaneous analysis of N-and O-linked glycosylation following minimal sample preparation and without the need for protein deglycosylation makes the lectin microarray analysis described a valuable tool for discovery phase glycomic profiling. 2011 The Author.",NA,"article *breast cancer breast tumor cancer cell cancer growth cancer patient disease association human intraductal carcinoma *metastasis priority journal protein binding protein determination protein glycosylation *protein microarray protein structure fetuin glycan jacalin *lectin/ec [Endogenous Compound] n acetylgalactosamine peanut agglutinin plant lectin soybean agglutinin","1060-1070","21","2011",-1

Deaths from CRC account for around 8% of all cancer deaths, making it the fourth most common cause of death from cancer. The high mortality rate of colon cancer is mainly attributable to its metastasis. Efforts have been made to identify metastasis suppressor genes, which encode proteins responsible for inhibiting the metastasis but not suppressing the growth of primary tumors. Studies on metastasis suppressor genes demonstrated that epigenetic modifications, such as DNA promoter methylation and histone modification, play crucial roles in regulating the expression of many metastasis suppressor genes, which indicates the association between aberrant epigenetic alterations and cancer metastasis. This review will focus on the recent findings regarding metastasis suppressors regulated by epigeneticmodifications, particularly DNA methylation and histone modification, in CRC metastasis. Also, we will discuss recent progress on the suppression of CRC metastasis by genistein, a soy isoflavone, with a focus on epigenetic mechanisms. 2011 Landes Bioscience.",NA,"article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer inhibition cancer mortality cancer patient cancer survival cell adhesion cell differentiation cell migration chromatin immunoprecipitation *colon cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] colorectal cancer *DNA methylation DNA modification *epigenetics gene overexpression gene silencing *histone modification human in vitro study in vivo study *metastasis n myc downstream regulated gene 1 nonhuman oncogene c myb polymerase chain reaction prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] protein expression protein methylation receptor down regulation receptor upregulation 5 aza 2' deoxycytidine/pd [Pharmacology] agouti protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] butyric acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] gelsolin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] green fluorescent protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] matrix metalloproteinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] nucleoside diphosphate kinase A/ec [Endogenous Compound] phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] trichostatin A/pd [Pharmacology] uvomorulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] vorinostat/pd [Pharmacology]","849-852","6","2011",-1

The specific mechanisms of action of most phytochemicals in cancer prevention are not yet clear but appear to be varied. One class of compounds currently under investigation is flavonoids, a large group of molecules with similar structure. Although their bioavailability is discussed, numerous in vitro and animal model data suggest that flavonoids modulate important cellular and molecular mechanisms related to carcinogenesis, a multistep process involving the transformation, survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of the tumor cells. Epidemiological studies confirmed that, among many flavonoids, apigenin, epigallocatechin gallate, delphinidin and genistein appear to be beneficial compounds in various stages of carcinogenesis. Therefore, according to in vitro and in vivo studies, this review attempts to increase our understanding about the preventive and therapeutic effects of these compounds to facilitate extrapolation of results from animal studies to human situations. 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"angiogenesis antiangiogenic activity antiinflammatory activity *antineoplastic activity antioxidant activity apoptosis article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer inhibition cancer survival *carcinogenesis cell cycle arrest cell cycle G0 phase cell cycle G1 phase cell invasion cell proliferation chemoprophylaxis cytotoxicity degenerative disease/dt [Drug Therapy] diabetes mellitus/dt [Drug Therapy] digestive system cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] disease free survival DNA damage endothelium cell esophagus cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] health promotion heart disease/dt [Drug Therapy] human in vivo culture lung cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman oxidative stress prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] skin cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] skin tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] tumor growth tumor microenvironment angiogenesis inhibitor/an [Drug Analysis] angiogenesis inhibitor/dv [Drug Development] antiinflammatory agent/an [Drug Analysis] antiinflammatory agent/dv [Drug Development] *antineoplastic agent/an [Drug Analysis] *antineoplastic agent/dv [Drug Development] antioxidant/an [Drug Analysis] antioxidant/dv [Drug Development] apigenin/an [Drug Analysis] apigenin/dv [Drug Development] apigenin/dt [Drug Therapy] apigenin/po [Oral Drug Administration] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] cyclin dependent kinase 2 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 cytochrome c delphinidin/an [Drug Analysis] delphinidin/dv [Drug Development] delphinidin/dt [Drug Therapy] delphinidin/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] delphinidin/pd [Pharmacology] delphinidin/tp [Topical Drug Administration] epigallocatechin gallate/an [Drug Analysis] epigallocatechin gallate/dv [Drug Development] epigallocatechin gallate/dt [Drug Therapy] epigallocatechin gallate/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin gallate/tp [Topical Drug Administration] *flavonoid/an [Drug Analysis] *flavonoid/dv [Drug Development] focal adhesion kinase 1 free radical gelatinase B genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/dv [Drug Development] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/po [Oral Drug Administration] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] interleukin 12 Ki 67 antigen oncoprotein ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor p21 activated kinase polyphenol protein Bak protein Bax protein bcl 2 protein p16 protein p27 reactive oxygen metabolite steroid receptor coactivator 3 vasodilator agent/an [Drug Analysis] vasodilator agent/dv [Drug Development]","62-77","9","2011",-1

Botta","Fyn kinase in brain diseases and cancer: The search for inhibitors","Fyn is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the Src family kinases. It has been shown to play important roles in neuronal functions, including myelination and oligodendrocytes formation, and in inflammatory processes. It has also demonstrated its involvement in signaling pathways that lead to severe brain pathologies, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, Fyn is upregulated in some malignancies. Experimental studies demonstrated that Fyn inhibition could be useful in the disruption of metabolic processes involved in cancer and in neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately no specific Fyn inhibitor has been discovered so far, being the reported compounds active also on other members of Src family or on different tyrosine kinases. However, multitargeted inhibitors might be endowed with therapeutic potential. Indeed, as increasingly reported, also a not completely selective inhibitor of a specific protein could be therapeutically useful, affecting a number of cell pathways involved especially in cancer development. In this review, we report some examples of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors for which data on Fyn inhibition, both in enzymatic and in cell assays, have been reported, with the aim of giving information as starting point for the researchers working in this field. 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"Alzheimer disease article *brain disease breast cancer cell assay central nervous system function chronic myeloid leukemia enzymatic assay human medulloblastoma multiple myeloma *neoplasm nonhuman oncogene src ovary cancer pancreas cancer parkinsonism prostate cancer protein family protein function protein structure squamous cell carcinoma tauopathy 2,3 dihydro 2 oxo 3 (4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 1h indol 2 ylmethylene) 1h indole 5 sulfonic acid dimethylamide/pd [Pharmacology] 4 amino 7 tert butyl 5 (4 chlorophenyl)pyrazolo[3,4 d]pyrimidine/pd [Pharmacology] 4 amino 7 tert butyl 5 (4 methylphenyl)pyrazolo[3,4 d]pyrimidine/pd [Pharmacology] 6 (2,6 dichlorophenyl) 2 [3 (hydroxymethyl)anilino] 8 methylpyrido[2,3 d]pyrimidin 7(8h) one/pd [Pharmacology] [4 [2 cyclopentyl 9 (3 hydroxyphenethyl)purin 6 ylamino]phenyl]dimethylphosphine oxide/pd [Pharmacology] a 420983 bms 279700 bosutinib/pd [Pharmacology] caffeic acid/pd [Pharmacology] coumarin derivative/pd [Pharmacology] ct 5102 ct 5263 dasatinib/pd [Pharmacology] delphinidin/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] imatinib/pd [Pharmacology] kx2 391 myricetin/pd [Pharmacology] n [4 (3 bromoanilino) 6 quinazolinyl]acrylamide/pd [Pharmacology] *protein kinase Fyn/ec [Endogenous Compound] *protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] pyrazolo[3,4 d]pyrimidine derivative/pd [Pharmacology] quinazoline/pd [Pharmacology] quinoline derivative/pd [Pharmacology] rosmarinic acid/pd [Pharmacology] saracatinib/po [Oral Drug Administration] saracatinib/pd [Pharmacology] staurosporine/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","2921-2942","18","2011",-1

Utian Translational Science Symposium in Chicago, IL (October 2010)","Objectives: If and to what extent soy protein, soy isoflavones, and their metabolites, including S(-)-equol, have beneficial effects on women's health is currently unclear. The North American Menopause Society (NAMS)/Utian Translational Science Symposium on Soy and Soy Isoflavones convened October 9-10, 2010, to clarify basic and clinical research findings as they relate to the risk and benefits of soy products for peri- and postmenopausal women. Methods: A working group of faculty and panelists composed of clinical and research experts in the fields of women's health and botanicals met during a 2-day translational symposium to cover the latest evidence-based science on isoflavones as they affect menopausal symptoms, breast and endometrial cancer, atherosclerosis, bone loss, and cognition. Full descriptions of the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of isoflavones were also presented. Subspecialty groups then broke off with the goal of translating the information into a report for general medical practice and identifying further research areas. All faculty and panelists reviewed the final report, which was then approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Results: From the hundreds of studies reviewed in this report, there are mixed results of the effects on midlife women. Soy-based isoflavones are modestly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms; supplements providing higher proportions of genistein or increased in S(-)-equol may provide more benefits. Soy food consumption is associated with lower risk of breast and endometrial cancer in observational studies. The efficacy of isoflavones on bone has not been proven, and the clinical picture of whether soy has cardiovascular benefits is still evolving. Preliminary findings on cognitive benefit from isoflavone therapy support a ""critical window"" hypothesis wherein younger postmenopausal women derive more than older women. Conclusions: Several areas for further research have been identified on soy and midlife women. More clinical studies are needed that compare outcomes among women whose intestinal bacteria have the ability to convert daidzein to equol (equol producers) with those that lack that ability (equol nonproducers) in order to determine if equol producers derive greater benefits from soy supplementation. Larger studies are needed in younger postmenopausal women, and more research is needed to understand the modes of use of soy isoflavone supplements in women. The interrelations of other dietary components on soy isoflavones consumed as a part of diet or by supplement on equol production also require further study, as do potential interactions with prescription and over-the-counter medications. And finally, greater standardization and documentation of clinical trial data of soy are needed. 2011 by The North American Menopause Society.",NA,"article atherosclerosis bone density breast cancer cardiovascular effect China climacterium clinical research cognition drug absorption drug bioavailability drug elimination drug half life drug mechanism endometrium cancer food intake general practice human Japanese medical society *menopause metabolite nonhuman North America osteoblast osteolysis postmenopause protein expression randomized controlled trial (topic) risk benefit analysis soybean soybean milk United States vaginal dryness/dt [Drug Therapy] women's health aglycone/ct [Clinical Trial] aglycone/pk [Pharmacokinetics] aglycone/pd [Pharmacology] alkaline phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] daidzein/ct [Clinical Trial] daidzein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] equol/ct [Clinical Trial] equol/pk [Pharmacokinetics] equol/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] genistein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glycitein/ct [Clinical Trial] glycitein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] glycitein/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone derivative/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone derivative/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] placebo puerarin/ct [Clinical Trial] puerarin/pk [Pharmacokinetics] puerarin/pd [Pharmacology] *soy isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *soy isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *soy isoflavone/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *soy isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] soybean oil soybean protein unclassified drug","732-753","18","2011",-1

The process was strongly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium, a known inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, and by nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of lipoxygenases. This led us to suggest that both enzymes could be involved. With the purpose of identifying natural compounds present in food with the ability to decrease the production of acetaldehyde in mammary tissue, in the present studies, several plant polyphenols having inhibitory effects on lipoxygenases and of antioxidant nature were tested as potential inhibitors of the rat mammary tissue microsomal pathway of ethanol oxidation. We included in the present screening study 32 polyphenols having ready availability and that were also tested against the rat mammary tissue cytosolic metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Several polyphenols were also able to inhibit the microsomal ethanol oxidation at concentrations as low was 10-50 muM. The results of these screening experiments suggest the potential of several plant polyphenols to prevent in vivo production and accumulation of acetaldehyde in mammary tissue.

Preclinical evidence suggests vitamin E, selenium, and soy protein may prevent progression of HGPIN to PCa. This hypothesis was tested in a randomized phase III double-blind study of daily soy (40 g), vitamin E (800 U), and selenium (200 mug) versus placebo. Patients and Methods: Three hundred three men in 12 Canadian centers were analyzed. The main eligibility criterion was confirmed HGPIN in at least one of two biopsies within 18 months of random assignment. Treatment was administered daily for 3 years. Follow-up prostate biopsies occurred at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postrandomization. The primary end point was time to development of invasive PCa. Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests were used to compare two treatment groups for this end point. Results: For all patients, the median age was 62.8 years. The median baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA; n = 302) was 5.41 ug/L; total testosterone (n = 291) was 13.4 nmol/L. Invasive PCa developed among 26.4% of patients. The hazard ratio for the nutritional supplement to prevent PCa was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.67 to 1.60; P = .88). Gleason score distribution was similar in both groups with 83.5% of cancers graded Gleason sum of 6. Baseline age, weight, PSA, and testosterone did not predict for development of PCa. The supplement was well tolerated with flatulence reported more frequently (27% v 17%) among men receiving micronutrients. Conclusion: This trial does not support the hypothesis that combination vitamin E, selenium, and soy prevents progression from HGPIN to PCa. 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",NA,"adult article Canada cancer center cancer growth *cancer prevention cancer survival chemoprophylaxis controlled study diarrhea/si [Side Effect] *diet supplementation disease free survival double blind procedure drug safety drug tolerability flatulence/si [Side Effect] follow up gastrointestinal symptom/si [Side Effect] Gleason score *high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia human human tissue hyperglycemia/si [Side Effect] major clinical study male multicenter study patient compliance phase 3 clinical trial priority journal prostate biopsy *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] *prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia randomized controlled trial testosterone blood level *alpha tocopherol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial] *alpha tocopherol/cb [Drug Combination] *alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] *alpha tocopherol/po [Oral Drug Administration] placebo prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *selenium/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *selenium/ct [Clinical Trial] *selenium/cb [Drug Combination] *selenium/dt [Drug Therapy] *selenium/po [Oral Drug Administration] *soybean protein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *soybean protein/ct [Clinical Trial] *soybean protein/cb [Drug Combination] *soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] *soybean protein/po [Oral Drug Administration] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound]","2386-2390","29","2011",-1

In the present study we investigated the effect of feeding cow ghee versus soybean oil on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced mammary cancer in rat and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor- (PPAR-) in mammary gland. Methods: Two groups of 21 day old female rats (30 each) were fed for 44 wk diet containing cow ghee or soybean oil (10%). The animals were given DMBA (30mg/kg body weight) through oral intubation after 5 wk feeding. Another two groups (8 each) fed similarly but not given DMBA served as control for the gene expression study. Results: In DMBA treated groups, the animal fed soybean oil had higher tumour incidence (65.4%), tumour weight (6.18 g) and tumour volume (6285 mm3) compared to those fed cow ghee (26.6%, 1.67 g, 1925 mm3, respectively). Tumour latency period was 23 wk on soybean oil compared to 27 wk on cow ghee. Histological analysis of tumours showed that the progression of carcinogenesis was more rapid on soybean oil than on cow ghee. The expression of cyclooxygenase-2 was observed only in DMBA treated rats and it was significantly less on cow ghee than on soybean oil. The expression of PPAR- was significantly more on cow ghee than on soybean oil. Interpretation & conclusions: Our results show that dietary cow ghee opposed to soybean oil attenuates mammary carcinogenesis induced by DMBA; and the effect is mediated by decreased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and increased expression of PPAR- in the former group.",NA,"animal experiment article *breast cancer *carcinogenesis controlled study fat intake female gene expression histopathology mammary gland nonhuman rat *7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene *cow ghee *cyclooxygenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *milk fat *peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soybean oil unclassified drug","497-503","133","2011",-1

In this manner, they can regulate the occupancy and trans-activation of the androgen, estrogen and progesterone receptors. The AKR1C isoforms also have important roles in the production and inactivation of neurosteroids and prostaglandins, and in the metabolism of xenobiotics. They thus represent important emerging drug targets for the development of agents for the treatment of hormone-dependent forms of cancer, like breast, prostate and endometrial cancers, and other diseases, like premenstrual syndrome, endometriosis, catamenial epilepsy and depressive disorders. We present here the physiological roles of these enzymes, along with their structural properties and an overview of the recent developments regarding their inhibitors.

This study initially investigated the effects of dietary soy consumption on maternal thyroid functions and anti-TPO antibody (TPOAb) production during early pregnancy. Data were collected through questionnaire from 505 women enrolled during early pregnancy by random sampling in Shenyang, China. Based on soy intake frequency, the subjects were divided into three groups (frequent [three or more times per week], conventional [more than twice per month but less than three times per week], and occasional [two or fewer times per month]). Serum thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and TPOAb were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Additionally, the concentrations of two primary isoflavones (daidzein and genistein) and creatinine were assessed in the spot urine samples from representative subjects (about 20%) randomly selected from the three groups. The percentages of frequent, conventional, and occasional consumers were 18.6%, 62.6%, and 18.8%, respectively. No difference was found in age, medical records, family history of thyroid diseases, serum FT4, TSH, and TPOAb levels, TPOAb-positive percentages, or prevalence of thyroid dysfunctions among the groups. Both urinary daidzein and genistein levels were significantly higher in the frequent consumers compared with the other two groups. No correlations were found between urinary isoflavone levels and serum FT4 or TSH.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the activity of magnolia bark extract added to isoflavones and lactobacilli in menopausal women with typical menopausal symptoms and concomitant borderline psychoaffective and/or sleep alterations, of severity not requiring a psychopharmacological therapy. Methods. Menopausal women were enrolled in a multicenter, controlled, parallel-group study and randomized to E (isoflavones 60 mg + Lactobacillus sporogenes + calcium and vitamin D3 - Estromineral, Rottapharm Madaus) versus ES (magnolia bark extract + E - Estromineral serena) 1 tablet/night for 12 weeks. Results. In 91 gynecological centers, 634 women were treated (300 with E and 334 with ES), mean age 53.1 years and Body Mass Index (BMI) 25.2 kg/m2; 28% were past hormone replacement therapy HRT users and 3.3% had had a previous breast cancer. Both treatments significantly reduced versus baseline the symptoms tested at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. E and ES showed a similar efficacy on hot flushing, nocturnal sweating with awakenings, palpitations and vaginal dryness. ES was more active on insomnia, irritability, anxiety, depressed mood, asthenia and loss of libido. Woman's well-being and physician's final judgment were positive in >70% in both groups. The rate of adverse events was 1% with E (metrorrhagia, cramps and constipation) and 1.2% with ES (gastralgia, blood loss, constipation and breast tension). Conclusion. Isoflavones are effective in improving the classical menopause symptoms. The clinical activity of magnolia bark extract on the relevant psycho-affective symptoms, particularly anxiety, irritability and insomnia, was evident.

"905","813"," J. P. Levine","Treating menopausal symptoms with a tissue-selective estrogen complex","Vasomotor symptoms and vulvar-vaginal atrophy are common consequences of menopause, and the only treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is hormone therapy. Because both physicians and women are concerned with the tolerability and safety profile of estrogen and estrogen plus progestin treatments, alternative menopause therapies are needed. An ideal menopause treatment modality would relieve menopausal vasomotor and vulvar-vaginal symptoms, maintain bone mass, and have neutral or beneficial cardiovascular effects, without stimulating the breast or endometrium. The novel tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC) agent was paired with a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with estrogen(s) in an attempt to achieve a more favorable clinical profile based on the blended tissue activities of its components. This article reviews the published reports from Phase III trials of TSEC, which paired bazedoxifene (BZA) and conjugated estrogens (CEs). BZA/CE alleviated menopausal symptoms and prevented postmenopausal bone loss, had an overall good safety profile with an incidence of amenorrhea and breast pain similar to that with placebo, and did not stimulate the endometrium. The largest (N = 3397) and longest (2 years) study of this TSEC containing BZA/CE demonstrated endometrial hyperplasia rates similar to that with placebo and changes in lumbar spine bone mineral density that were significantly better than that with placebo, when a minimum dose of 20 mg of BZA was used with 0.625 or 0.45 mg of CE. Subsequent smaller studies showed that BZA/CE effectively reduced the incidence and frequency of hot flushes and significantly improved signs and symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Longer term safety with regard to cardiovascular and breast effects have not been established. Given the efficacy and safety reported in these Phase III trials, the TSEC of BZA/CE may be a promising new option for the treatment of menopause.",NA,"amenorrhea article bloating/si [Side Effect] bone density breast discomfort/si [Side Effect] breast disease/si [Side Effect] clinical effectiveness clinical evaluation coronary artery disease/si [Side Effect] depression/si [Side Effect] disease severity drug dose comparison drug effect drug efficacy drug safety drug tolerability drug withdrawal endometrium endometrium hyperplasia/dt [Drug Therapy] endometrium hyperplasia/si [Side Effect] estrogen activity estrogen blood level estrogen therapy fatigue/si [Side Effect] gastrointestinal symptom/si [Side Effect] heart infarction/si [Side Effect] hormone substitution hot flush/dm [Disease Management] hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] hot flush/si [Side Effect] human ischemic heart disease/si [Side Effect] lifestyle modification low drug dose lumbar spine mastalgia *menopausal syndrome/dm [Disease Management] *menopausal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] musculoskeletal pain/si [Side Effect] osteolysis osteopenia phase 3 clinical trial (topic) postmenopause osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] postmenopause osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] postmenopause osteoporosis/th [Therapy] priority journal quality of life side effect/si [Side Effect] triacylglycerol blood level vagina atrophy/dt [Drug Therapy] venous thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] *bazedoxifene/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *bazedoxifene/ct [Clinical Trial] *bazedoxifene/cb [Drug Combination] *bazedoxifene/cm [Drug Comparison] *bazedoxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] bisphosphonic acid derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] calcitonin/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/cm [Drug Comparison] clonidine/dt [Drug Therapy] *conjugated estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *conjugated estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *conjugated estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] *conjugated estrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] *conjugated estrogen/do [Drug Dose] *conjugated estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] denosumab/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] estrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] estrogen/tp [Topical Drug Administration] estrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] gabapentin/cm [Drug Comparison] gabapentin/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] gestagen/cb [Drug Combination] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] parathyroid hormone[1-34]/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo raloxifene/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] raloxifene/cm [Drug Comparison] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor/cm [Drug Comparison] serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] serotonin uptake inhibitor/cm [Drug Comparison] serotonin uptake inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy]","57-68","8","2011",-1

There has been increasing recognition that diet plays an important role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Despite this, the largely heterogenous nature of prostate cancer and nutritional research often means that no definitive conclusions can be drawn for those seeking answers in this important topic. In this review article, we summarize the key evidence available in this topic to date. Although we found mounting evidence on certain nutritional components being important in prostate cancer prevention and progression, further high quality studies are needed to fully understand the complex nature of diet and prostate cancer. There is now increasing evidence that diet plays a major role in prostate cancer biology and tumorigenesis. In a health conscious society, it is becoming increasingly common for Urologists to be asked about the impact of diet on prostate cancer. In the present review, we explore the current evidence for the role of different dietary components and its' effect on prostate cancer prevention and progression. A literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify key studies. There was some evidence to suggest that green tea, isoflavones, lycopenes, cruciferous vegetables and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid intake to be beneficial in the prevention and/or progression of prostate cancer. There was also evidence to suggest that a high total fat, meat (especially well cooked) and multivitamin intake may be associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.

"911","823"," M. Mimeault, S. K. Batra","Potential applications of curcumin and its novel synthetic analogs and nanotechnology-based formulations in cancer prevention and therapy","Curcumin has attracted great attention in the therapeutic arsenal in clinical oncology due to its chemopreventive, antitumoral, radiosensibilizing and chemosensibilizing activities against various types of aggressive and recurrent cancers. These malignancies include leukemias, lymphomas, multiple myeloma, brain cancer, melanoma and skin, lung, prostate, breast, ovarian, liver, gastrointestinal, pancreatic and colorectal epithelial cancers. Curcumin mediates its anti-proliferative, anti-invasive and apoptotic effects on cancer cells, including cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies, through multiple molecular mechanisms. The oncogenic pathways inhibited by curcumin encompass the members of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR and erbB2), sonic hedgehog (SHH)/GLIs and Wnt/beta-catenin and downstream signaling elements such as Akt, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). In counterbalance, the high metabolic instability and poor systemic bioavailability of curcumin limit its therapeutic efficacy in human. Of great therapeutic interest, the selective delivery of synthetic analogs or nanotechnology-based formulations of curcumin to tumors, alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs, may improve their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic efficacies against cancer progression and relapse. Novel curcumin formulations may also be used to reverse drug resistance, eradicate the total cancer cell mass and improve the anticarcinogenic efficacy of the current anti-hormonal and chemotherapeutic treatments for patients with various aggressive and lethal cancers. 2011 Mimeault and Batra; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"antineoplastic activity apoptosis brain cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] brain cancer/pc [Prevention] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer cell cancer growth/pc [Prevention] *cancer prevention cancer relapse/pc [Prevention] cancer stem cell *cancer therapy chemoprophylaxis clinical trial (topic) colorectal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] colorectal cancer/pc [Prevention] cytotoxicity diarrhea/si [Side Effect] digestive system cancer/pc [Prevention] drug bioavailability drug formulation drug induced headache/si [Side Effect] drug mechanism feces color human leukemia/pc [Prevention] liver cancer/pc [Prevention] lung adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] lung cancer/pc [Prevention] lymphoma/pc [Prevention] melanoma/pc [Prevention] multiple myeloma/pc [Prevention] nanotechnology nausea/si [Side Effect] nonhuman ovary cancer/pc [Prevention] pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] pancreas cancer/pc [Prevention] progeny prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] review side effect/si [Side Effect] skin cancer/pc [Prevention] skin tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] systematic review therapy effect antineoplastic agent/an [Drug Analysis] antineoplastic agent/dv [Drug Development] antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] beta catenin/ec [Endogenous Compound] celecoxib/cb [Drug Combination] celecoxib/dt [Drug Therapy] cisplatin/cb [Drug Combination] cisplatin/pd [Pharmacology] *curcumin/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *curcumin/ct [Clinical Trial] *curcumin/an [Drug Analysis] *curcumin/cb [Drug Combination] *curcumin/dv [Drug Development] *curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] *curcumin/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *curcumin/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] *curcumin/po [Oral Drug Administration] *curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] *curcumin/tp [Topical Drug Administration] dasatinib/cb [Drug Combination] dasatinib/dt [Drug Therapy] daunorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] daunorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] demethoxycurcumin/an [Drug Analysis] demethoxycurcumin/dv [Drug Development] demethoxycurcumin/pd [Pharmacology] didemethoxycurcumin/pd [Pharmacology] dimethoxycurcumin/an [Drug Analysis] dimethoxycurcumin/dv [Drug Development] dimethoxycurcumin/pd [Pharmacology] doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] doxorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] ef 24/an [Drug Analysis] ef 24/dv [Drug Development] ef 24/pd [Pharmacology] epidermal growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] epigallocatechin gallate/cb [Drug Combination] epigallocatechin gallate/dt [Drug Therapy] fluorouracil/cb [Drug Combination] fluorouracil/dt [Drug Therapy] fluorouracil/pd [Pharmacology] gemcitabine/cb [Drug Combination] gemcitabine/dt [Drug Therapy] go y030 immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone/cb [Drug Combination] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] omega 3 fatty acid/cb [Drug Combination] omega 3 fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] oxaliplatin/cb [Drug Combination] oxaliplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] phenethyl isothiocyanate/cb [Drug Combination] phenethyl isothiocyanate/dt [Drug Therapy] phenethyl isothiocyanate/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] phenethyl isothiocyanate/pd [Pharmacology] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] resveratrol/cb [Drug Combination] resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] sonic hedgehog protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] STAT protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand/dt [Drug Therapy] tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] unclassified drug unindexed drug vincristine/cb [Drug Combination] vincristine/pd [Pharmacology] Wnt protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"6","2011",-1

We investigated the effects of GEN on mouse uterine cells, in vivo and in vitro. Oral administration of GEN for 1. week induced mild proliferation of the endometrium in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, which was accompanied by the induction of steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) gene expression. GEN administration induced demethylation of multiple CpG sites in the SF-1 promoter; these sites are extensively methylated and thus silenced in normal endometrium. The GEN-mediated promoter demethylation occurred predominantly on the luminal side, as opposed to myometrium side, indicating that the epigenetic change was mainly shown in regenerated cells. Primary cultures of endometrial stromal cell colonies were screened for GEN-mediated alterations of DNA methylation by a high-resolution melting (HRM) method. One out of 20 colony-forming cell clones showed GEN-induced demethylation of SF-1. This clone exhibited a high proliferation capacity with continuous colony formation activity through multiple serial clonings.

Inhibiting aromatase is a major strategy in treating breast cancer patients. However, suppression on the transcriptional activity may be equally important in controlling aromatase. Dietary flavones and flavonones have been previously demonstrated to be the most potent aromatase-inhibitory flavonoids. In the present study we examined their effects on the transcription regulation of CYP19 in MCF-7 cells. Real-time PCR results indicated that luteolin suppressed CYP19 mRNA expression while hesperetin increased it. Reporter gene assays were employed to look into the transactivity of CYP19 driven by promoters I.3 and II, and the result was consistent with the observation in mRNA expression. Further investigation using truncation reporter gene and electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggested that luteolin and hesperetin differentially influenced AP-1- and C/EBP-binding on the CYP19 promoter. Western blot analysis indicated that signaling transduction pathways involving JNK and ERK could be the underlying mechanisms for their actions. The present study showed that dietary flavones and flavonones might differentially regulate aromatase transcription in breast cells in addition to the inhibition at the enzyme level. 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,"article *breast cancer *cancer cell controlled study *dietary intake differential display enzyme inhibition estrogen synthesis gel mobility shift assay gene expression human human cell IC 50 priority journal real time polymerase chain reaction reporter gene signal transduction transcription regulation Western blotting apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] *aromatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] *flavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] *flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] *flavonone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] hesperetin/pd [Pharmacology] luteolin/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","51-58","344","2011",-1

Wake","Effects of S-equol and natural S-equol supplement (SE5-OH) on the growth of MCF-7 in vitro and as tumors implanted into ovariectomized athymic mice","Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for treatment of menopausal symptoms is controversial because of reported breast cancer resulting from estrogen treatment and consequent estrogenic stimulation. S-equol, a natural metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein produced by intestinal bacteria, has been shown to ameliorate menopausal symptoms, with relatively low concomitant estrogenic receptor stimulation. Although synthesis of equol produces the racemate, the S-isomer may be produced in commercial amounts by bacterial fermentation of soy germ, during the production of the supplement SE5-OH. This study aims to investigate the effects of S-equol and SE5-OH on the growth of MCF-7 in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, purified S-equol, and the isoflavonoid mixture present in SE5-OH stimulated estrogenic transcriptional activity and proliferation of MCF-7-E10 cells, similar to that observed for genistein (another soy isoflavone), but at concentrations from 104-fold to 106-fold higher than seen with 17beta-estradiol (E2).Ovariectomized (OVX) mice implanted with MCF-7-E10 cells were fed diets containing 250 or 500. ppm of purified S-equol, isoflavonoid mixture, or genistein. There were no significant differences in tumor growth between the treatment groups and control group.

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling regulates proliferation, differentiation and fate specification in developmental stages and controls tissue homeostasis in adult life. For these reasons, this pathway has received great attention in the last years as potential pathway involved in distinct Human pathologies.

(Du-zhong), a well known Chinese herbal medicine, has been increasingly used as a nutraceutical supplement. The aim of this study was to identify and characterise novel estrogenic compounds in E. ulmoides. We report that six compounds, namely pinoresinol 4'-O-beta-d- glucopyranoside, pinoresinol di-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, aucubin, wogonin, baicalein, and alpha-O-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-4,2',4'- trihydroxydihydrochalcone, activated estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent transcription of both transfected and endogenous target genes. Strikingly, these compounds exhibited significant difference in ER subtype (alpha vs. beta) selectivity. Cell proliferation and ER subcellular localisation analyses also demonstrated that they mediated the estrogenic effects by the genomic action of ERalpha. This study suggests that E. ulmoides is a rich source of new selective estrogen receptor modulators and evaluations of its health benefit and safety as a food additive should take into account the diverse phytoestrogen activities of the individual components. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the association between BMI20y and ER/PR-defined breast cancer risk among 41,594 women in the population-based Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Anthropometric factors were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Through to the end of 2006, 452 breast cancer cases were identified. We observed a statistically significant inverse association between BMI20y and breast cancer incidence [multivariable-adjusted RR for each 5-unit increment 0.75 (95%CI = 0.61-0.92)], which was not modified by menopausal or recent BMI status. In contrast, recent BMI and subsequent BMI gain were not associated with increased risk among premenopausal women, but were substantially associated with increased risk among postmenopausal women [corresponding RR recent BMI = 1.31 (95%CI = 1.07-1.59); RR subsequent BMI gain = 1.32 (95%CI = 1.09-1.60)]. In subanalyses by receptor status (~50% of cases), the observed inverse association of BMI20y with risk was consistent with the result for ER-PR- [0.49 (95%CI = 0.27-0.88)], while the observed positive associations of BMI gain with postmenopausal breast cancer risk appeared to be confined to ER+PR+ tumors [corresponding RR for subsequent BMI gain =2.24 (95%CI = 1.50-3.34)]. Low BMI at age 20 years was substantially associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. In contrast, high recent BMI and subsequent BMI gain from age 20 were associated with increased risk of postmenopausal ER+PR+ tumors.

Liu","Synthesis of nanocarriers with remote magnetic drug release control and enhanced drug delivery for intracellular targeting of cancer cells","Nanotherapeutic strategy is well recognized as the therapeutic approach of the future. Numerous reports have demonstrated the use of nanoparticulate drug carriers for the development of targeted nanotherapeutics by, for instance, incorporation of a moiety that specifically targets certain diseased cells. However, systematic investigation of this aspect has been inadequate, especially with regard to nanosystems with remotely controlled drug delivery. The authors previously designed a magnetic-responsive core-shell drug delivery nanosystem which proved to be technically feasible in vitro. In the present study, this nanosystem is modified for targeted delivery of an anticancer agent (encapsulated camptothecin (CPT)) to cancer cells overexpressing epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) with accurate intracellular drug release. The endocytosis of the nanocarriers by cancer cells, the pathway of cellular uptake and the subsequent intracellular controlled drug delivery were systematically investigated. It was found that the modified nanocarriers showed reasonably high drug load efficiency for CPT and a high uptake rate by cancer cells overexpressing EGFR through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The intracellular release of the CPT molecules via an external magnetic stimulus proved to be technically successful and ensured much higher therapeutic efficacy than that obtained with the free drug. This study employs multiple functions for nanotherapeutic treatment of specific target cells, i.e. cell-specific targeting, controlled cellular endocytosis and magnetic-responsive intracellular drug release. 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

Sarkar","Notch-1 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition consistent with cancer stem cell phenotype in pancreatic cancer cells","Activation of Notch-1 is known to be associated with the development and progression of human malignancies including pancreatic cancer. Emerging evidence suggest that the acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and induction of cancer stem cell (CSC) or cancer stem-like cell phenotype are interrelated and contributes to tumor recurrence and drug resistance. The molecular mechanism(s) by which Notch-1 contributes to the acquisition of EMT phenotype and CSC self-renewal capacity has not been fully elucidated. Here we show that forced over-expression of Notch-1 leads to increased cell growth, clonogenicity, migration and invasion of AsPC-1 cells. Moreover, over-expression of Notch-1 led to the induction of EMT phenotype by activation of mesenchymal cell markers such as ZEB1, CD44, EpCAM, and Hes-1. Here we also report, for the first time, that over-expression of Notch-1 leads to increased expression of miR-21, and decreased expression of miR-200b, miR-200c, let-7a, let-7b, and let-7c. Re-expression of miR-200b led to decreased expression of ZEB1, and vimentin, and increased expression of E-cadherin. Over-expression of Notch-1 also increased the formation of pancreatospheres consistent with expression of CSC surface markers CD44 and EpCAM. Finally, we found that genistein, a known natural anti-tumor agent inhibited cell growth, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, EMT phenotype, formation of pancreatospheres and expression of CD44 and EpCAM. These results suggest that the activation of Notch-1 signaling contributes to the acquisition of EMT phenotype, which is in part mediated through the regulation of miR-200b and CSC self-renewal capacity, and these processes could be attenuated by genistein treatment. 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",NA,"antineoplastic activity article *cancer cell cell growth cell migration cell renewal controlled study down regulation *epithelial mesenchymal transition gene expression regulation gene overexpression human human cell morphology *pancreas cancer phenotype priority journal signal transduction upregulation wound healing beta actin/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] epithelial cell adhesion molecule/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein Hermes antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *Notch1 receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] oncoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein zeb1/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein zeb2/ec [Endogenous Compound] synaptotagmin I/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor HES 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor RelA/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug vimentin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","26-36","307","2011",-1

Priebe","A genistein derivative, ITB-301, induces microtubule depolymerization and mitotic arrest in multidrug-resistant ovarian cancer","Purpose: To investigate the mechanistic basis of the anti-tumor effect of the compound ITB-301. Methods: Chemical modifications of genistein have been introduced to improve its solubility and efficacy. The anti-tumor effects were tested in ovarian cancer cells using proliferation assays, cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescence, and microscopy. Results: In this work, we show that a unique glycoside of genistein, ITB-301, inhibits the proliferation of SKOv3 ovarian cancer cells. We found that the 50% growth inhibitory concentration of ITB-301 in SKOv3 cells was 0.5 muM. Similar results were obtained in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines. ITB-301 induced significant time- and dose-dependent microtubule depolymerization. This depolymerization resulted in mitotic arrest and inhibited proliferation in all ovarian cancer cell lines examined including SKOv3, ES2, HeyA8, and HeyA8-MDR cells. The cytotoxic effect of ITB-301 was dependent on its induction of mitotic arrest as siRNA-mediated depletion of BUBR1 significantly reduced the cytotoxic effects of ITB-301, even at a concentration of 10 muM. Importantly, efflux-mediated drug resistance did not alter the cytotoxic effect of ITB-301 in two independent cancer cell models of drug resistance. Conclusion: These results identify ITB-301 as a novel anti-tubulin agent that could be used in cancers that are multidrug resistant. We propose a structural model for the binding of ITB-301 to alpha- and beta-tubulin dimers on the basis of molecular docking simulations. This model provides a rationale for future work aimed at designing of more potent analogs. 2011 The Author(s).",NA,"acute granulocytic leukemia article breast cancer cancer cell culture cancer inhibition cell proliferation concentration response controlled study drug cytotoxicity drug mechanism female human human cell *microtubule depolymerization *mitosis inhibition *multidrug resistance *ovary cancer/dr [Drug Resistance] priority journal protein depletion *protein modification Bub1 related protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] colchicine doxorubicin *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *itb 301/cm [Drug Comparison] *itb 301/pd [Pharmacology] nocodazole/cm [Drug Comparison] paclitaxel/cb [Drug Combination] paclitaxel/cm [Drug Comparison] small interfering RNA unclassified drug verapamil/cb [Drug Combination]","1033-1044","68","2011",-1

In this study, the eVects of the lignan secoisolariciresinol and the isoXavone glycosides and aglycones genistein, genistin, daidzein and daidzin were tested on MCF-7 and BT20 cells in vitro. Methods First, the cellular expression of hormone receptors was examined by immunohistochemical procedures. The eVects of the phytooestrogens on the cells were detected by using three diVerent assays measuring cell letality, viability and proliferation. The phytooestrogens were tested in concentrations of 1, 5, 10 and 50 mug/mL, respectively. 17beta-oestradiol and tamoxifen were used as controls, respectively, in the same concentrations as the phytooestrogens. Results The immunohistochemistry showed evidence of oestrogen- and progesterone receptors at the MCF-7 cell line, whereas no expression could be seen at the BT20 cells. Among the phytooestrogens, genistein and secoisolariciresinol showed various anti-cancerogenic eVects on both cell lines, respectively, but only in the highest concentration. Regarding the controls, tamoxifen showed a stronger antivital and anti-proliferative eVect on BT20 than on MCF-7. Oestradiol caused sporadic anti-cancer eVects on both cell lines, respectively, at its highest concentration. Conclusions Genistein and Secoisolariciresinol have anticancer properties on MCF-7 and BT20 in vitro. There are diVerences in the eVects of isoXavones depending on the glycolysation status. The role of the oestrogen receptors in the mechanisms of action of both the phytooestrogens and controls is of less importance. Further investigations have to be carried out, especially concerning the mechanisms of action. Phytooestrogens may be potential substances in the therapy of mamma carcinomas.

Katzenellenbogen","Estrogen receptor beta ligands: Recent advances and biomedical applications","Recent work elucidating the role that the estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays in regulating various physiological functions has highlighted the potential of this receptor subtype as a therapeutic target for several pathologies. In fact, molecules that are able to selectively activate ERbeta hold promise for the treatment of certain cancers, as well as endometriosis, inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular and CNS conditions. Nevertheless, ERbeta remains a challenging target because its ligand-binding cavity is very similar to that present in ERalpha, and this makes it difficult to develop ligands having sufficient levels of ERbeta selectivity for therapeutic use. Nevertheless, considerable advances have recently been made in developing both nonsteroidal and steroidal ERbeta-selective agonists. These molecules constitute not only important tools to probe the biological effects of the selective stimulation of ERbeta, but some of them appear to be agents with considerable therapeutic potential. This study provides a detailed review of selective ERbeta ligands that have been developed recently. After a brief introduction to the structure and nature of the two ERs and the biology of ERbeta and its isoforms, the ligands are classified on the basis of their structures and activities. Common pharmacophore elements are highlighted throughout the description of the various chemical classes analyzed, and these elements are presented in a concluding summary overview along with a discussion of potential therapeutic applications of these agents in biomedicine. 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,"antiinflammatory activity article biomedicine breast breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cardiovascular disease central nervous system disease colon disease/dt [Drug Therapy] drug receptor binding drug structure endometriosis fertility hormone substitution hot flush human IC 50 metabolic regulation neuropathic pain/dt [Drug Therapy] neuroprotection nonhuman protein localization rheumatoid arthritis/dt [Drug Therapy] RNA translation structure activity relation 21 (4 diethylaminomethyl 2 methoxyphenoxy) 7alpha methyl 19 norpregna 1,3,5(10) trien 3 ol/pd [Pharmacology] 3beta androstanediol/cm [Drug Comparison] 3beta androstanediol/pd [Pharmacology] androstanediol/cm [Drug Comparison] androstanediol/pd [Pharmacology] androstenediol/cm [Drug Comparison] androstenediol/pd [Pharmacology] androstenediol derivative/pd [Pharmacology] apigenin/cm [Drug Comparison] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] benzofuran derivative/pd [Pharmacology] benzothiophene derivative/pd [Pharmacology] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] coumestrol/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] diarylpropionitrile/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol derivative/pd [Pharmacology] estriol/cm [Drug Comparison] *estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] ginsenoside Rb 1/pd [Pharmacology] imidazole derivative/pd [Pharmacology] indene derivative/pd [Pharmacology] indole derivative/pd [Pharmacology] kaempferol/cm [Drug Comparison] kaempferol/pd [Pharmacology] liquiritigenin/pd [Pharmacology] naringenin/cm [Drug Comparison] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] phthalimide derivative/pd [Pharmacology] prinaberel/an [Drug Analysis] prinaberel/dt [Drug Therapy] prinaberel/pd [Pharmacology] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] unindexed drug","364-442","31","2011",-1

We demonstrated that this approach can be used to elucidate new molecular targets using a model TCM herbal formula Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) which is widely used for women's health. The human breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with 0.1 muM estradiol or 2.56 mg/ml of SWT showed dramatic gene expression changes, while no significant change was detected for ferulic acid, a known bioactive compound of SWT. Pathway analysis using differentially expressed genes related to the treatment effect identified that expression of genes in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) cytoprotective pathway was most significantly affected by SWT, but not by estradiol or ferulic acid. The Nrf2-regulated genes HMOX1, GCLC, GCLM, SLC7A11 and NQO1 were upreguated by SWT in a dose-dependent manner, which was validated by real-time RT-PCR. Consistently, treatment with SWT and its four herbal ingredients resulted in an increased antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity in MCF-7 and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of differentially expressed genes related to SWT treatment was used to compare with those of 1,309 compounds in the CMAP database. The CMAP profiles of estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells showed an excellent match with SWT treatment, consistent with SWT's widely claimed use for women's diseases and indicating a phytoestrogenic effect. The CMAP profiles of chemopreventive agents withaferin A and resveratrol also showed high similarity to the profiles of SWT. This study identified SWT as an Nrf2 activator and phytoestrogen, suggesting its use as a nontoxic chemopreventive agent, and demonstrated the feasibility of combining microarray gene expression profiling with CMAP mining to discover mechanisms of actions and to identify new health benefits of TCMs.",NA,"antioxidant responsive element article cell protection cell strain HEK293 cell strain MCF 7 Chinese medicine concentration response controlled study drug mechanism gene expression profiling gene identification human human cell microarray analysis oxidative stress reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validation study carrier proteins and binding proteins/ec [Endogenous Compound] *Chinese drug/pd [Pharmacology] glutamate cysteine ligase/ec [Endogenous Compound] heme oxygenase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone)/ec [Endogenous Compound] *si wu tang/pd [Pharmacology] solute carrier family 7 member 11 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Nrf2/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug",NA,"6","2011",-1

Objective: The effects of Griff C on the regulation of the expression of proliferation markers such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D1 (CD1) and Ki-67 are investigated here. Its role in apoptosis or cell survival, through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) signaling pathway is further studied. Materials and methods: Semiquantitative real-time PCR was performed to analyze the effects of Griff C on gene expression in MCF-7 cells. Western blot analysis was used to assess the role of Griff C on the expression of phosphorylated Akt in MCF-7 cells. Results: Griff C induced a 4.84-fold increase in the expression of Ki-67 mRNA at the concentration of 10-8 M and a 3.90-fold increase of CD1 mRNA at 10-7 M. Griff C slightly increased the phosphorylation of Akt at its serine 473 residue. Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, but not by the specific estrogen receptor antagonist, fulvestrant. Discussion and conclusion: These findings suggest that Griff C can modulate proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Our results also suggest that Griff C can affect the PI3K-related signaling pathway. Thus, Griff C may exert part of its low proliferative and antiapoptotic effects by a nongenomic mode of action. 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",NA,"apoptosis article *breast adenocarcinoma cancer cell culture carcinoma cell cell proliferation cell strain MCF 7 cell survival controlled study drug effect drug mechanism drug structure enzyme activation enzyme phosphorylation estrogen responsive element *gene expression regulation human human cell human cell culture Millettia Millettia griffoniana real time polymerase chain reaction signal transduction upregulation Western blotting 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone antineoplastic agent chloroform cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] cycline/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] fulvestrant *griffonianone C/an [Drug Analysis] *griffonianone C/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] millettia griffoniana extract phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] plant extract protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] serine/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","341-347","49","2011",-1

Garcia-Martinez","Neuroprotective actions of flavonoids","The experimental evidences accumulated during last years point out a relevant role of oxidative stress in neurodegeneration. As anti-cellular oxidative stress agents flavonoids can act either as direct chemical antioxidants, the classic view of flavonoids as antioxidants, or as modulators of enzymes and metabolic and signaling pathways leading to an overshot of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, a more recently emerging concept. Flavonoids, a large family of natural antioxidants, undergo a significant hepatic metabolism leading to flavonoid-derived metabolites that are also bioactive as antioxidant agents. The development of more efficient flavonoid's based anti-oxidative stress therapies should also take into account their bioavailability in the brain using alternate administration protocols, and also that the major ROS triggering the cellular oxidative stress are not the same for all neurodegenerative insults and diseases.On these grounds, we have reviewed the reports on neuroprotection by different classes of flavonoids on cellular cultures and model animals. In addition, as they are now becoming valuable pharmacological drugs, due to their low toxicity, the reported adverse effects of flavonoids in model experimental animals and humans are briefly

CHP was efficiently obtained from soybean meal by hydrolysis with flavourzyme and alcalase. In this study, the effects of CHP on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis were investigated in rat insulinoma cells (RINm5F) secreting insulin. When the RINm5F cells were treated with 2mM STZ, insulin secretion decreased to approximately 54% that of control cells. However, CHP treatment restored the insulin-secreting activity of RINm5F cells to approximately 71% that of the untreated control cells. Moreover, CHP significantly protected the cells from STZ-mediated cytotoxicity via reduction of nitric oxide (NO) production (2.3-fold) and lipid peroxidation (1.9-fold), which were induced by STZ. Moreover, CHP treatment also attenuated STZ-induced apoptotic events, such as activation of caspase-3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in RINm5F cells, indicating that CHP could protect the cells from apoptotic cell death induced by oxidative stress of STZ by increasing the expression of an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. These results suggest that CHP could be a candidate material for a protective and therapeutic agent against STZ-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis 2009 by the Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.",NA,"animal cell *apoptosis article cell proliferation *cell protection cell viability concentration response controlled study *cytotoxicity DNA fragmentation drug effect drug mechanism enzyme activity in vitro study insulin release insulinoma lipid peroxidation nonhuman oxidative stress pancreas islet beta cell protein cleavage protein expression rat upregulation caspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] *cyclo(histidylproline)/pd [Pharmacology] insulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] nitric oxide/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein Bax/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] streptozocin","218-227","21","2011",-1

Sundar","Insight into the enzyme-inhibitor interactions of the first experimentally determined human aromatase","Aromatase is an important pharmacological target in the anti-cancer therapy as the intratumoral aromatase is the source of local estrogen production in breast cancer tissues. Suppression of estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase inhibition represents an effective approach for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Because of the membrane-bound character and heme-binding instability, no crystal structure of aromatase was reported for a long time, until recently when crystal structure of human placental aromatase cytochrome P450 in complex with androstenedione was deposited in PDB. The present study is towards understanding the structural and functional characteristics of aromatase to address unsolved mysteries about this enzyme and elucidate the exact mode of binding of aromatase inhibitors. We have performed molecular docking simulation with twelve different inhibitors (ligands), which includes four FDA approved drugs; two flavonoids; three herbal compounds and three compounds having biphenyl motif with known IC50 values into the active site of the human aromatase enzyme. All ligands showed favorable interactions and most of them seemed to interact to hydrophobic amino acids Ile133, Phe134, Phe221, Trp224, Ala306, Val370, Val373, Met374 and Leu477 and hydrophilic Arg115 and neutral Thr310 residues. The elucidation of the actual structure-function relationship of aromatase and the exact binding mode described in this study will be of significant interest as its inhibitors have shown great promise in fighting breast cancer.

Few studies have investigated the association between ovarian cancer and intake of phytoestrogens. We evaluated the associations between intake of phytoestrogens (isoflavonoids/lignans/coumestrol) and fiber (vegetable/cereal) and risk of ovarian cancer. Methods: In 1991-1992 a prospective population-based cohort study among Swedish women was conducted, including 47,140 women with complete dietary questionnaire data. During follow-up until December 2007, 163 women developed invasive (n = 117) and borderline (n = 46) ovarian cancers. The median follow-up time was 16 years and total person year was 747,178. Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to estimate multivariate risk ratios, 95% CI for associations with risk of ovarian cancer. Results: We found no association between intake of phytoestrogens or fiber and overall ovarian cancer risk. In addition, we found no statistically significant association between intake of specific food items rich in phytoestrogens (berries, nuts, beans/soy, and crisp or whole-grain bread) and ovarian cancer risk overall. Fiber and coumestrol was inversely associated with borderline ovarian cancer, but not with invasive ovarian cancer. Conclusions: We found no association between intake of phytoestrogens or fiber and overall ovarian cancer risk. Impact: Phytoestrogens do not play a major etiologic role in ovarian cancer, at least among women in this Swedish cohort with low bean/soy intake. However, our results of a difference in the effect of fiber or coumestrol between invasive and borderline ovarian cancer need to be evaluated in larger studies. 2011 AACR.",NA,"adult article bean berry bread cancer risk cereal controlled study *dietary intake disease association female follow up grain human lifestyle major clinical study nut *ovary cancer/et [Etiology] population based case control study priority journal prospective study vegetable coumestrol isoflavonoid lignan *phytoestrogen","308-317","20","2011",-1

In addition, 2 large studies have shown that there is an association between hormone therapy and breast cancer risk in women without an earlier history of breast cancer.

One such agent is the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, which has demonstrated clinical activity both in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and in the frontline setting. Other attractive agents being explored in the maintenance setting include epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, and the citrus pectin-derived galectin-3 inhibitor GCS-100.

The sscMap method has been shown to provide enhanced sensitivity in mapping meaningful connections leading to testable biological hypotheses and in identifying drug candidates with particular pharmacological and/or toxicological properties. Challenges remain, however, as to how to prioritise the large number of discovered connections in an unbiased manner such that the success rate of any following-up investigation can be maximised. We introduce a new concept, gene-signature perturbation, which aims to test whether an identified connection is stable enough against systematic minor changes (perturbation) to the gene-signature. We applied the perturbation method to three independent datasets obtained from the GEO database: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cervical cancer, and breast cancer treated with letrozole. We demonstrate that the perturbation approach helps to identify meaningful biological connections which suggest the most relevant candidate drugs. In the case of AML, we found that the prevalent compounds were retinoic acids and PPAR activators. For cervical cancer, our results suggested that potential drugs are likely to involve the EGFR pathway; and with the breast cancer dataset, we identified candidates that are involved in prostaglandin inhibition. Thus the gene-signature perturbation approach added real values to the whole connectivity mapping process, allowing for increased specificity in the identification of possible therapeutic candidates. 2011 McArt, Zhang.",NA,"acute granulocytic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy] *analytic method article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer cell cell adhesion cell proliferation gene expression *gene signature pertubation genetic database scoring system treatment indication uterine cervix cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *antineoplastic agent chlorpromazine/dt [Drug Therapy] dilazep/dt [Drug Therapy] diphemanil methylsulfate/cb [Drug Combination] diphemanil methylsulfate/dt [Drug Therapy] fluphenazine/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] histone deacetylase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] letrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] paclitaxel/cb [Drug Combination] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma phenothiazine derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] retinoic acid riluzole/cb [Drug Combination] riluzole/dt [Drug Therapy] solasodine/dt [Drug Therapy] sulfamethoxazole/cb [Drug Combination] sulfamethoxazole/dt [Drug Therapy] tranylcypromine/dt [Drug Therapy] trichostatin A/dt [Drug Therapy]",NA,"6","2011",-1

Schmitz-Drager","Nutritional aspects of primary prostate cancer prevention","There are three well-known and indisputable risk factors for development of prostate cancer, namely heredity, ethnic origin, and increasing age. Geographic variations in incidence rates are considerable and, therefore, it has been suggested that environmental factors may also play a role. Data from migration studies clearly show that men with the same genetic background raised in different environments present the risk of the disease associated with their country of residency. Prostate cancer is a good candidate for studies on primary prevention due to several specific features such as high prevalence, long latency, hormonal dependency, serum markers for monitoring (prostate specific antigen), and histological precursor lesions (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). Nutritional factors that may influence the disease include total energy intake (as reflected by body mass index), dietary fat, cooked meat, micronutrients and vitamins (carotenoids, retinoids, vitamins C, D and E), fruit and vegetable intake, minerals (calcium, selenium), and phytoestrogens (isoflavonoids, flavonoids, lignans). Most studies reported to date are case-control analysis. The selenium and vitamin E cancer prevention trial (SELECT), however, is a population-based, prospective, randomized clinical trial to examine the effect of selenium and vitamin E alone or in combination on prostate cancer risk reduction. The trial was discontinued recently as there was no evidence of a benefit from either agent. Nevertheless, lifestyle changes could be recommended to men at risk for developing clinical prostate cancer. 2010 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,"age alcohol consumption antioxidant activity article caloric intake cancer incidence cancer prevention cancer risk diabetes mellitus diet supplementation *diet therapy environmental factor ethnic difference evidence based medicine fat intake food intake fruit geographic distribution heredity high risk patient hormone dependence human kinesiotherapy lifestyle modification meat Mediterranean diet nutritional assessment obesity physical activity population migration practice guideline primary prevention priority journal *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/et [Etiology] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] *prostate cancer/th [Therapy] prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia risk assessment risk reduction vegetable weight control alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial] alpha tocopherol/cb [Drug Combination] alpha tocopherol/cm [Drug Comparison] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] ascorbic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] ascorbic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] beta carotene/ct [Clinical Trial] beta carotene/cb [Drug Combination] beta carotene/cm [Drug Comparison] beta carotene/dt [Drug Therapy] calcitriol/pd [Pharmacology] calcium carotenoid phytoestrogen placebo prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] retinoid selenium/ct [Clinical Trial] selenium/cb [Drug Combination] selenium/cm [Drug Comparison] selenium/dt [Drug Therapy] trace element vitamin D","101-107","188","2011",-1

I. substituent effects, hormone potency, and receptor subtype selectivity in a new family of flexible estrogenic compounds","Long-term use of estrogen supplements by women leads to an increased risk of breast and uterine cancers. Possible mechanisms include metabolism of estradiol and compounds related to tumor-initiating quinones, and ligand-induced activation of the estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta which can cause cancer cell proliferation, depending on the ratio of receptors present. One therapeutic goal would be to create a spectrum of compounds of variable potency for ERalpha and ERbeta, which are resistant to quinone formation, and to determine an optimum point in this spectrum. We describe the synthesis, modeling, binding affinities, hormone potency, and a measure of quinone formation for a new family of A-CD estrogens, where the A-C bond is formed by ring coupling. Some substituents on the A-ring increase hormone potency, and one compound is much less quinone-forming than estradiol. These compounds span a wide range of receptor subtype selectivities and may be useful in hormone replacement therapy. 2010 American Chemical Society.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment animal model article binding affinity controlled study drug potency drug synthesis hormone substitution male nonhuman rat *equilenin/an [Drug Analysis] *equilenin/dv [Drug Development] *equilenin/pd [Pharmacology] *estradiol/an [Drug Analysis] *estradiol/cb [Drug Combination] *estradiol/dv [Drug Development] *estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrone/an [Drug Analysis] *estrone/cb [Drug Combination] *estrone/dv [Drug Development] *estrone/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/an [Drug Analysis] *genistein/dv [Drug Development] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] quinone derivative/to [Drug Toxicity] receptor subtype/ec [Endogenous Compound]","433-448","54","2011",-1
"969","879"," L. Mologni","Development of RET kinase inhibitors for targeted cancer therapy","RET (Rearranged during Transfection) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase expressed in central and peripheral nervous system and neural crest-derived cells and acts as a co-receptor of GDNF family neurotrophic factor in complex with GRFa family proteins. RET protein comprises an extracellular portion with four cadherine-like domains and a cysteine-rich region important for intermolecular interactions; a hydrophobic transmembrane domain; an intracellular part comprising the juxtamembrane domain with regulatory function and the catalytic domain that phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of substrates. RET is involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life. Mutations of RET are associated to a subset of colorectal cancer and are commonly found in hereditary and sporadic thyroid cancer. Activating point mutations in the cystein-rich or the kinase domain of RET cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), a group of familial cancer syndromes characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, parathyroid hyperplasia and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastroenteric mucosa. Rearranged forms of RET (termed RET/PTC) are detected in the majority of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC). At present, the therapeutic treatment available for these pathologies is the total or partial surgical removal of thyroid, associated with radio-iodine therapy or chemotherapy: despite widespread use of multimodality treatment, survival rates have not improved much in the past few decades, which suggests that new treatment options should be explored. Several small-molecule inhibitors of RET kinase activity have been described in the last decade, some of which are currently undergoing clinical evaluation. Here, I review the large preclinical effort to the development of specific RET inhibitors, including medicinal chemistry analyses that may help refine potency and selectivity of future RET-targeted

The objective of this study is to examine the association between dairy products, calcium intake, and breast cancer risk among Chinese women. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted among Chinese women in the Guangdong province from June 2007 to August 2008. Four hundred and thirty-eight consecutively recruited cases with primary breast cancer were frequency-matched to 438 controls on age and residence. Dietary intake information was collected by interviewers using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression adjusted for various potential confounders. We observed a statistically significant inverse association of dietary calcium intake with breast cancer risk, with the adjusted OR (95% CI) of 0.35 (0.22-0.56) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile. No significant association was found between dairy products measured either by dry weight of dairy product or dairy product protein intake and breast cancer risk. Our study supports a protective effect of high intake of dietary calcium on breast cancer risk, and no association with dairy product intake.

Vervoort","Quantitative proteomics and transcriptomics addressing the estrogen receptor subtypemediated effects in T47D breast cancer cells exposed to the phytoestrogen genistein","The present study addresses, by transcriptomics and quantitative stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics, the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta)-mediated effects on gene and protein expression in T47D breast cancer cells exposed to the phytoestrogen genistein. Using the T47D human breast cancer cell line with tetracycline-dependent ERbeta expression (T47D-ERbeta), the effect of a varying intracellular ERalpha/ERbeta ratio on genistein-induced gene and protein expression was characterized. Results obtained reveal that in ERalpha-expressing T47D-ERbeta cells with inhibited ERbeta expression genistein induces transcriptomics and proteomics signatures pointing at rapid cell growth and migration by dynamic activation of cytoskeleton remodeling. The data reveal an interplay between integrins, focal adhesion kinase, CDC42, and actin cytoskeleton signaling cascades, occurring upon genistein treatment, in the T47D-ERbeta breast cancer cells with low levels of ERalpha and no expression of ERbeta. In addition, data from our study indicate that ERbeta-mediated gene and protein expression counteracts ERalpha-mediated effects because in T47D-ERbeta cells expressing ERbeta and exposed to genistein transcriptomics and proteomics signatures pointing at a clear down-regulation of cell growth and induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were demonstrated. These results suggest that ERbeta decreases cell motility and metastatic potential as well as cell survival of the breast cancer cell line. It is concluded that the effects of genistein on proteomics and transcriptomics end points in the T47D-ERbeta cell model are comparable with those reported previously for estradiol with the ultimate estrogenic effect being dependent on the relative affinity for both receptors and on the receptor phenotype (ERalpha/ERbeta ratio) in the cells or tissue of interest. 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,"actin filament apoptosis article *breast cancer cancer cell culture cell cycle arrest cell growth cell migration cell motility cell survival controlled study gene expression human human cell metastasis potential priority journal protein expression proteomics quantitative analysis transcriptomics actin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] focal adhesion kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] fulvestrant/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] integrin/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein Cdc42/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"10","2011",-1

Sarkar","Restoring sensitivity to oxaliplatin by a novel approach in gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo","Oxaliplatin (OxP) has been used in combination therapy with gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic cancer (PC), but the beneficial effect was marginal, which is believed to be due to de novo and acquired drug resistance of PC. Here, we report our in vitro and in vivo preclinical evidence in support of chemosensitization of drug-resistant cells by a nontoxic chemopreventive agent (genistein). Genistein pretreatment together with low concentration of OxP showed significant reduction in cell viability and colony formation concomitant with increased apoptosis (p < 0.01), which was highly synergistic. Drug resistance of PC is allegedly linked with both constitutive and OxP-induced activation of NF-B, and we found that inactivation of (nuclear factor kappa B) NF-B by genistein before treatment of cells with OxP was required for cell killing, which was consistent with the downregulation of NF-B and its downstream antiapoptotic genes (Bcl-2, XIAPs and survivin). Most importantly, our in vivo experiments using orthotopic mouse model showed significant reduction in tumor size (p < 0.01) and reduction of locoregional lymph node metastasis by combination treatment. These results were also consistent with inactivation of NF-B and the downregulation of NF-B downstream genes, decreased proliferation marker (Ki-67) and increased apoptosis (TUNEL) in tumor remnants, all of which was consistent with in vitro findings. From these results, we conclude that genistein sensitizes drug-resistant PC to OxP, which is mechanistically linked with inactivation of NF-B signaling, resulting in greater antitumor effects, and thus our data suggest that this approach could be useful in improving the treatment outcome for patients diagnosed with PC. 2010 UICC.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment animal model animal tissue antineoplastic activity apoptosis article cell viability chemosensitization colony formation controlled study down regulation enzyme inhibition female histopathology human human cell immunohistochemistry in vitro study in vivo study lymph node metastasis/co [Complication] mouse nick end labeling nonhuman *pancreas cancer/dr [Drug Resistance] *pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] priority journal protein expression signal transduction tumor volume breast cancer resistance protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase 9/ec [Endogenous Compound] gelatinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] *gemcitabine/cb [Drug Combination] *gemcitabine/dt [Drug Therapy] *gemcitabine/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/po [Oral Drug Administration] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound] Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *oxaliplatin/cb [Drug Combination] *oxaliplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] *oxaliplatin/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] *oxaliplatin/pd [Pharmacology] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] small interfering RNA survivin/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor RelA/ec [Endogenous Compound] vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] X linked inhibitor of apoptosis/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1240-1250","128","2011",-1

The research focused on the kinetics of alterations in urinary 8-isoPGF2at the early stage of carcinogenesis as well as the influence of dietary factors on the process. The impact of selected compounds on the intensity of DMBA - induced carcinogenesis was also assessed. Result and conclusions. Administration of DMBA, a compound that inducers mammary tumors in experimental animals, increased the serum and urinary 8-isoPGF2levels in study rats. In the rat model, diet supplementation with zinc, combined with selected polyphenolic compounds (resveratrol or genistein) yielded a statistically significant decrease in the rat serum and urinary biomarker concentration with a simultaneously significant stimulation of carcinogenesis.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of herbal medicine use among cancer patients in the West Midlands, and determine the characteristics predicting herbal medicine use.Methods:A cross-sectional survey of oncology patients (n1498) being followed up at a hospital in Coventry was undertaken. Recipients were asked about herbal medicine use since their cancer diagnosis, and the association between sociodemographic and cancer-related characteristics and herbal medicine use was evaluated.Results:A total of 1134 responses were received (75.7%). The prevalence of herbal medicine use was 19.7% (95% CI: 17.4-22.1; n223). Users were more likely to be affluent, female, and aged under 50 years. Usage increased with time since cancer diagnosis (X 2 for trend4.63; P0.031). A validation data set, derived from a survey of oncology patients in Birmingham (n541) with differing socioeconomic characteristics showed no significant difference in estimated prevalence (16.6%; 95% CI: 11.9-22.2).Conclusion:A substantial number of people with cancer are likely to be taking herbal medicines.

Wiese","Structure-activity relationships of flavonoids as inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)","Flavonoids are an interesting group of natural products ubiquitously present in human diet. Their consumption has been associated with various and differing beneficial health effects. However, several flavonoids have been reported to inhibit the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) encoded by the ABCG2 gene. Thus, the consumption of flavonoids with high inhibitory activity could change pharmacokinetics and drug levels of drugs that are BCRP substrates. In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy an increased intake of such flavonoids could lead to adverse effects. We investigated a structurally diverse set of flavonoids, including derivatives with a rare C-methylated structure that were isolated from plants used in traditional medicine. The flavones retusin and ayanin were found to be highly potent inhibitors of BCRP, showing only slightly less potency than Ko143, the most potent ABCG2 inhibitor known so far. The activity data were analyzed by 2D and 3D QSAR analyses and the results revealed the impact of the different substituents at the various positions of the flavonoid core on activity. Additionally, a lateral 2D QSAR analysis of data collected from the literature was performed aiming to derive more general information about the influence of distinct structural features on the inhibitory potency of flavonoids. The comparative QSAR analyses led to a consistent picture of the effects of the different substituents at various positions of the flavone backbone. The following structural features were found to contribute positively to BCRP inhibition: a hydroxyl group in position 5, double bond between position 2 and 3, and a methoxy group in position 3. The exchange of a 3-methoxy group by an OH-group acting also as a hydrogen bond donor, resulted in decrease in activity underlining the potential role of the hydrogen bond acceptor 3-OCH3 for the interaction with BCRP. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Methods.We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study among 53,578 women in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Leisure-time physical activity was assessed by self-reported questionnaires. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to derive relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Results.From 1990-1993 to the end of 2007, 652 cases were identified. The breast cancer rates (per 100,000 person-years) in the sedentary groups (<3days/month) was 84 in overall, 97 in premenopausal and 75 in postmenopausal women. We observed a statistically significant inverse association between leisure-time physical activity and breast cancer risk (relative risk<3days/week vs <3days/month=0.73; 95% confidence interval 0.54-1.00; ptrend 0.037), particularly in estrogen receptor+progesterone receptor+ (relative risk 0.43; 0.19-1.00; ptrend 0.022), and this inverse trend was apparent among postmenopausal women (relative risk 0.25; 0.06-1.06; ptrend 0.041). An inverse trend was also observed between daily total physical activity and postmenopausal estrogen receptor+progesterone receptor+ risk (p=0.046). Among body mass index >25kg/m2 group, leisure-time physical activity was associated with decreased risk (relative risk>1day/week vs <3days/month=0.65; 0.43-0.97; ptrend 0.033).

These steroids were incubated with increasing concentrations of equol (0-2,000 nM) and analyzed by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography. 14C5alpha-DHT peak/profiles were determined by scintillation counting of column fractions. Using the 14C5alpha-DHT peak (0 nM equol) as a reference standard, a binding curve was generated by quantifying shifts in the 14C5alpha-DHT peaks as equol concentrations increased. Second, equol's in vitro effects on LNCap cells were determined by culturing cells (48 hours) in the presence of increasing concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (vehicle-control), 5alpha-DHT, equol or 5alpha-DHT+equol. Following culture, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were quantified via ELISA. Finally, the in vivo effects of equol were tested in sixteen male Long-Evans rats fed a low isoflavone diet. From 190-215 days, animals received 0.1cc s.c. injections of either DMSO-control vehicle (n = 8) or 1.0 mg/kg (body weight) of equol (in DMSO) (n = 8). At 215 days, body and prostate weights were recorded, trunk blood was collected and serum assayed for luteinizing hormone (LH), 5alpha-DHT, testosterone and 17beta-estradiol levels.Results: Maximum and half maximal equol binding to 5alpha-DHT occurred at approximately 100 nM and 4.8 nM respectively. LNCap cells cultured in the presence of 5alpha-DHT significantly increased PSA levels. However, in the presence of 5alpha-DHT+equol, equol blocked the significant increases in PSA levels from LNCap cells. In vivo equol treatment significantly decreased rat prostate weights and serum 5alpha-DHT levels but did not alter LH, testosterone, and estradiol levels.Conclusions: Equol administration appears to have potential beneficial effects for prostate health and other 5alpha-DHT mediated disorders. Equol administration: reduces PSA levels from LNCap cells under 5alpha-DHT stimulation, decreases rat prostate size, decreases serum 5alpha-DHT levels and androgen hormone action, while not altering other circulating sex steroids or LH levels. 2011 Lund et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"animal cell animal experiment animal model animal tissue article assay binding affinity blood sampling cancer cell cell culture cell strain LNCaP column chromatography controlled study drug effect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay evidence based practice health status hormone blood level human human cell human tissue in vitro study in vivo study male nonhuman *prostate cancer rat scintillation counting standard *androstanolone/cb [Drug Combination] dimethyl sulfoxide *equol/cb [Drug Combination] *equol/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavonoid luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] sephadex steroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"9","2011",-1

The osteocalcin/deoxypyridinoline ratio and osteopontin/calcium ratio of cortical bone were selected as significant predictors. Introduction: Measurement of bone mineral density is widely used to assess bone strength, but this also depends on other bone components and on bone structure. The objective of this study was to investigate risk factors for fracture related to bone quality, the patient's history, and the patient's lifestyle. Methods: Twenty-one patients with femoral neck fracture and 18 patients with osteoarthritis were enrolled. Blood and urine samples were collected on admission to hospital, and bone samples were obtained from femoral necks resected during surgery. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using osteoarthritis and femoral neck fracture as combined variables to assess the influence of alcohol or coffee intake, eating natto (fermented soybeans), osteocalcin and calcium concentrations, the osteocalcin/ deoxypyridinoline ratio and osteopontin/calcium ratios of cortical bone and cancellous bone, various bone histomorphometric parameters, the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and the intact contralateral femoral neck, and various radiographic parameters of the spine Results: By forward stepwise multivariate analysis, the osteocalcin/deoxypyridinoline and osteopontin/calcium ratios of cortical bone were selected as significant factors for fracture (the odds ratios were 0.493 and <0.001, respectively; both P<0.001). Conclusions: A decrease of osteopontin and osteocalcin in bone is important for promoting vulnerability to hip fracture. 2010 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",NA,"adult aged alcohol consumption article blood sampling bone density *bone level bone metabolism bone tissue calcium bone level cancellous bone clinical article coffee controlled study cortical bone female femur head femur neck *femur neck fracture/et [Etiology] fermented product fragility fracture hip fracture hip radiography hip surgery hospital admission human human tissue lifestyle lumbar spine medical history morphometrics *osteoarthritis priority journal protein blood level protein urine level risk factor soybean spine radiography urinalysis alkaline phosphatase bone isoenzyme/ec [Endogenous Compound] amino terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] calcium/ec [Endogenous Compound] collagen type 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound] deoxypyridinoline/ec [Endogenous Compound] *osteocalcin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *osteopontin/ec [Endogenous Compound] phosphate/ec [Endogenous Compound]","587-597","22","2011",-1

Methods: One hundred fifty-three patients undergoing radiation therapy for various neoplasms at rural cancer centers in Minnesota completed the Mayo Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use Survey and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations questionnaires. Data regarding CAM use was also compared with provider consultation notes in the medical record at the onset of radiation therapy to determine rates of patient disclosure of CAM use to their healthcare providers. Results: A total of 153 participants completed the study with 61.4% females and 38.6% males and a mean age of 64.9 years. The two most frequent diagnoses of participants were breast cancer (43.8%) and prostate cancer (22.9%). CAM use was reported in 95% of the participants and was categorized into three domains: treatments and techniques, vitamins, and herbs and supplements. The three most frequently reported treatments and techniques were spiritual healing/prayer (62.1%), exercise (19.6%), and music (17.6%). The top three most frequently used biologically based CAM therapies were multivitamins (48.1%), calcium (37.3%), and vitamin with minerals (21.5%). The most frequently used herbs and other dietary supplements were fish oil (19.0%), flaxseed (15.0%), glucosamine (15.0%), and green tea (15.0%). The most common reason cited for CAM treatments and techniques use was previous use (26.1%), for use of vitamins and minerals was recommendation by a physician (33.0%), and for use of herbs and other supplements was previous use (19.0%). One hundred twelve participants reported taking vitamins, minerals, or supplements, and 47% of those 112 did not disclose this use to their providers. Conclusions: Consistent with previous research, our study found that the majority of cancer patients used CAM treatments. Spiritual healing/prayer was the most commonly reported, followed by multivitamins. Patients reported using CAM primarily due to previous use and physician recommendation.

The enteritis is linked to alcohol soluble components in SBM, but the mechanisms have not been established. Previous studies show that bacterial meal (BM) containing mainly Methylococcus capsulatus grown on natural gas is a suitable protein source for salmonids. The BM is rich in nucleotides, phospholipids, and small peptides that might be beneficial for intestinal homeostasis. In this study, a fish meal (FM)-based control diet (FM diet) and diets with 200 g/kg SBM (SBM diet), 300 g/kg BM(BM diet), and 300 g/kg BMand 200 g/kg SBM (BM-SBM diet) were fed to juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for 80 d. Dietary inclusion of SBM reduced growth (P = 0.007). Inclusion of BM reduced digestibility of protein (P = 0.002) and lipids (P = 0.011) and increased (P < 0.01) the relative weights (g/kg whole body) of total gut, liver, and stomach, and mid and distal intestine. Fish fed the SBM diet developed enteritis, lacked carbonic anhydrase 12 in the brush border of epithelial cells in distal intestine, and had more epithelial cells reacting for proliferating cell nuclear antigen compared with fish fed the other diets. Fish fed the same amount of SBM combined with BM showed no signs of inflammation in the distal intestine.

Protein S (PS) is mainly synthesized by hepatocytes, and its plasma level is decreased in high-estrogen conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate whether resveratrol affects PS expression in HepG2 cells. Methods and Results: The secreted and intracellular levels of PS were determined by an enzyme-linked ligandsorbent assay and Western blotting. The mRNA expressions of PS, protein C (PC) and beta chain of C4b-binding protein (C4BP-beta) were analyzed by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction. The PS gene promotor activities in HepG2 cells transiently expressing estrogen receptor (ER) alpha were examined by a luciferase reporter assay. Resveratrol dose- and timedependently down-regulated the PS expression in HepG2 cells at a transcriptional level, resulting in a significant decrease in secreted PS; however, the PC and C4BP-beta mRNA expressions were not affected. This action of resveratrol was not mediated through either the ER signaling or those of mitogen-activated protein kinases and protein kinase C. Piceatannol, a hydroxylated metabolite of resveratrol, and genistein, an isoflavone found in soy products, also down-regulated the PS expression. Diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic estrogen used for treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer, inhibited the PS expression in HepG2 cells. Conclusions: Resveratrol down-regulates the PS expression in HepG2 cells in an ER-independent manner. Other polyphenolic stilbene compounds, piceatannol and diethylstilbestrol, also inhibited the PS expression. It is reported that plasma PS levels of prostate cancer patients significantly decrease after treatment with diethylstilbestrol.

The bacteria and fungi's community is dynamic and diverse, and it can be modified with the environmental disturbance generating beneficial or harmful interactions to mares. It is suggested that the molecular mechanisms rule the physical associations, the communication inter spices, changes of the microbial behavior and the survival that happens when the bacteria and fungi occupy the same sites. The cooperative effects observed in infections caused for eukaryotes and prokaryotes might be due to the formation mixed biofilms. This growth it can promote the resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Uterine infections in not pregnant mares have become frequently by the widespread use of antibiotics and the manipulation in the intensive reproduction. Streptococcus equi zooepidemiccus, (Sez) is the most frequently isolated bacterium of endometritis. It is considered a part-mucosal of the vagina commen-sally. On the other hand the Candida (C) is isolated of vagina and uterus too, but the relations with the clinical uterine disease are confused because the recovery in culture is more frequent than it participations in the etiology of vaginal or uterine disease The aim of this study was to standardize a technology to evaluate the biofilm formation of to reference laboratory strain of Sez and C.

Zang","ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 inhibit proliferation and promote Tamoxifen-sensitivity in breast cancer cells","Introduction: Signalling through 17beta-Estradiol (E2) is mediated by two estrogen receptors (ERs), ERalpha and ERbeta. ERbeta is well established as a prognostic marker in breast cancer due to the beneficial effect of ERbeta-antagonist Tamoxifen (TAM) in adjuvant therapy. However, the roles of ERbeta-isoforms remain less clear, especially in relation to TAM-resistance of breast cancer cells. In this study, we analyzed the influence of ERbeta-isoforms, notably ER-2 and ERbeta5, on cell-proliferation and TAM-sensitivity in ERalpha+/beta-, ERalpha-/beta+, ERalpha+/beta+-breast cancer cells. Methods: The expression of ERbeta-isoforms in seven different breast cancer cell lines, including TAM-resistant cells (MCF-7-Tam), was examined by RT-PCR. The effects of ERbeta-activation on the proliferation of these cells were analyzed by MTT-assays, after incubation with TAM, the ERbeta-agonists Genistein, Diarylpropionitrile (DPN) or their combinations. In order to further characterize the roles of ERbeta2 and ERbeta5, we first assessed the expression of ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 by RT-PCR in TAM-sensitive cells (MCF-7; T47D) and MCF7-Tam after incubation with ERb-agonists or TAM. Secondly, we transfected MCF-7 and MCF-7-Tam cells with ERbeta2-or ERbeta5-expression-vectors. Then proliferation and sensitivity to TAM were analyzed in these genetically altered cells by proliferation assays. Results: Activation of ERbeta by Genistein and DPN increased the sensitivity to TAM in ERalpha+/beta+ cells (MCF-7; T47D) and dramatically re-sensitized MCF-7-Tam cells to TAM. Slight proliferation was measured in ERalpha-/beta+ cells (MDA-MB231; MDA-MB436) and no reaction was measured in Her-2 overexpressing cells (BT474; SKBR3). ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 were differently regulated by TAM or Genistein in TAM-sensitive cells and MCF-7-Tam cells. Moreover, overexpression of ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 increased the sensitivity of TAM-sensitive cells to TAM and, most interestingly, re-sensitized MCF-7-Tam cells to TAM. Conclusion: Our study strongly suggests the crucial impact of ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 on cellular proliferation and TAM-sensitivity of ERalpha+/beta+ breast cancer cells. These data provide insights in the complexity of response to antiestrogen therapy of breast cancer, especially in regards of primary and acquired TAMresistance.",NA,"*breast cancer *cancer cell cell proliferation assay agonist adjuvant therapy cancer cell culture expression vector therapy *tamoxifen genistein diarylpropionitrile antiestrogen estrogen receptor marker estradiol","209","34","2011",-1

Knowledge of effects of administration of other parts of pomegranate (e.g., peels) in laboratory animals is scarce, and effects in the vagina, uterus and mammary gland after administration have not been studied. We administered two doses of methanolic extract of pomegranate peels [mean daily uptake 100 (low) or 1000 mg/kg (high) body weight (bw)] orally over a period of 2 months to ovariectomized (ovx) rats and compared the effects with a treatment with two doses of 17 beta-estradiol [E2; 0.17(low) or 0.7 mg/kg bw (high)]. Vaginae, uteri, and mammary glands were investigated histologically. In rats treated with either of the E2 doses or the high dose of pomegranate, we found increases in uterine weight, and histologic analysis showed estrogeninduced features in the uteri.

Wang","Estrogen receptor-selectivity of phytoestrogens from traditional Chinese medicine","Estrogen replacement therapy (HRT) markedly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. However, the use of HRT as a cardioprotective strategy is greatly limited owing to carcinogenic effects of estrogens on the endometrium and breast in women. Recently, interest has focused on phytoestrogens, which are natural dietary plant compounds with estrogenic activity. Epidemiological studies also suggest that phytoestrogens are associated with a lower risk of breast and prostate cancer and cardiovascular disease. We found some phytoestrogens come from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with estrogen-like activity, which can increases ERE-luciferase activity in an ER subtype-dependent manner, but with different affinity to ER. We got seven compounds with estrogen-like activities from Psoralea corylifolia L. by chromatographic purification which are the two coumarins isopsoralen and psoralen, the four flavonoids isobavachalcone, bavachin, corylifol A and neobavaisoflavone, and the meroterpene phenol, bakuchiol. In reporter gene assay, the two coumarins acted as ER8-selective agonists while the other compounds activated both ER8 and ER8with more activation to ER8. From Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE we found Tan IIA can activate ER8 and ER8 transcription in transient transfected assay, with more activation to ER8. From Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., there were seven compounds including two lignans, one iridoids aucubin and four flavonoids(wogonin,baicalein,oroxylinA,a-0-p-D-glucopyranosyl-4,2',4' trihydroxydihydrochalcone), activated ER-dependent reporter gene on both ER subtypes. While, baicalein and wogonin had less potent on transactivation through ERalpha and exhibited ERbeta selectivity. From the study we found phytoestrogens from TCM showed different effection to ER and with cell specificity. The reasous can be summarized as follows: 1) different ER ligands (e.g., SERMs) may bind ER8 and ER8selectively; 2) the nature of the ligand and of the ER subtype determine the conformation of the ER-ligand complex; 3) the structure of the ER-ligand complex determines its ability to interact with other molecules, et al.",NA,"*Chinese medicine assay breast risk cardiovascular disease reporter gene human postmenopause endometrium female prostate cancer Psoralea purification agonist Salvia miltiorrhiza transactivation cell specificity estrogen therapy plant *phytoestrogen *estrogen receptor *steroid ligand estrogen coumarin derivative wogonin baicalein flavonoid bakuchiol luciferase angelicin psoralen phenol lignan iridoid aucubin","e190","126","2011",-1

Gunduz","Reversal of multidrug resistance in zoledronic acid resistant MCF7 cell line","Background: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is developed in tumor cells against various cytotoxic agents. Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate which interferes with cell-to-bone matrix attachment and prevents bone fractures in breast cancer treatment. Development of resistance to zoledronic acid was previously examined in our laboratory. Overexpression of breast cancer resistance protein could correlate with zoledronic acid resistance in MCF7 cell line. In the current study, the effect of isoflavonoid class inhibitor Biochanin-A was investigated in a zoledronic acid resistant MCF7 (MCF7/8000nMZol) cell line to reverse BCRP-mediated MDR. Methods: The MCF7/8000nMZol cell line was developed by stepwise selection in drug concentration increments and its resistance was confirmed by XTT cell proliferation assay. The expression of BCRP, MDR1, MRP1 and (beta-actin were analyzed by real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) after Biochanin-A treatment at different concentrations. The effect of Biochanin-A on proliferation of MCF-7/8000nMZol cells was investigated using XTT cell proliferation assay. Results: The MCF7/8000nMZol cell line showed approximately 3.5 fold resistance against zoledronic acid compared to MCF7/S. RT-qPCR results indicated increased BCRP expression level in MCF7/8000nMZol cells. MDR] and MRP1 expressions were not detected in both cell lines. Biochanin-A did not show toxic effects at low concentrations. Conclusion: These results indicate that overexpression of BCRP correlates with zoledronic acid resistance.

Easton","Associations between mammographic density and phytoestrogens","Introduction: Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that structurally resemble estradiol. By competing for estrogen receptors phytoestrogens may inhibit the binding of endogenous estrogens and reduce breast cancer risk. However, it is not clear if phytoestrogens act as weak estrogens in an environment of relatively low endogenous hormones as seen in post-menopausal women. Mammographic density(MD) is an independent risk factor for breast cancer and is known to be responsive to hormonal changes. Using MD as an intermediate marker of breast cancer risk, we studied the effect of phytoestrogen exposure to breast tissue composition. Methods: A cross-sectional study was done among postmenopausal women (n=1420) who were not on hormone replacement therapy from within the EPIC-Norfolk cohort(n=25,000). Dietary intake and urinary measurements were used to measure phytoestrogen exposure. Percent den-sity(PD) was measured using Boyd six-category scales for all women and in a smaller subset separate components of density [absolute dense area (DA) and non-dense area(ND)] was measured using computer-assisted method. Equol producer status was estimated using a urinary log10 equol: daidzein ratio of greater than-1.75 as an indication of equol production. Results: DA was not associated with urinary or dietary phytoestrogens. Enterolactone level in the urine was found to increase PD and decrease ND. However, these effects were lost on additional adjustments for BMI. Dietary enterolactone levels were also found to increase PD, which persisted after multi-variate adjustments. Stratified analysis showed the association to be among equol non-producers (6 = 0.53, P = 0.01). Dietary isoflavones intake was also found to decrease PD among equol non-producers (6 =-0.35, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Limited evidence for associations between phytoestro-gens and mammographic density offers reassurance that phytoestrogens do not act as estrogenic agents on breast tissue among post-menopausal women with habitual low consumption of phytoestrogens.",NA,"*density *breast surgery breast cancer female cancer risk exposure breast odontoid process computer plant reassurance environment risk factor urine cross-sectional study postmenopause hormone substitution dietary intake *phytoestrogen equol estrogen enterolactone daidzein hormone estradiol marker isoflavone derivative estrogen receptor","S28","37","2011",-1

Bergan","Circulating tumor cells in prostate cancer patients: Novel immunomagnetic enrichment method","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Pharmacological prevention of metastases would improve quality of life for many prostate cancer (PCa) patients. To metastasize, cancer cells must invade through the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix of the organ's stromal compartment to intravasate into the bloodstream thereby becoming circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The number of CTCs correlates with the formation of distant metastases. Rates of PCa death are ~10 fold lower among soy-consuming Southeast Asians than among non-soy consumers in the US. Genistein is a soy protein derivative that has been shown in vitro and in murine models to inhibit these early steps in the cascade. We implemented a Clinical Phase II Trial to determine whether genistein could decrease CTCs in men with prostate cancer (PCa). To measure this effect, we have developed a novel assay to detect and quantify CTCs in whole human blood. In addition to PSA, CTCs also express CK18. METHODS: Patients were randomized to genistein treatment (2mg/kg of genistein per day three weeks prior to radical prostatectomy) or no treatment (placebo). A whole blood sample was obtained prior to surgery. After RNA extraction the expression of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and cytokeratin 18 (CK18) genes was measured by quantitative RT/PCR, and we have optimized this method by using SABiosciences qPCR Master Mix. We also employ an additional technique of immunomagnetic precipitation to extract RNA from CTCs. Specifically, we coat Dynabeads (Invitrogen) with equal amounts of antibody to epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). RESULTS: Using a specific primer/probe set, we demonstrate that our qRT/PCR assay is linear over a wide range, and that we can detect PSA transcript in RNA from < 1 LNCaP cell. When LNCaP cells are spiked into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) from men without PCa, we demonstrate that we can detect 1 human prostate cell per 10 7 PBMNCs. In our phase II clinical trial we successfully detected CTCs in 13/17 (76.5%) patients. Our technique of dual antigen pull-down can detect 1 CTC per ml of whole blood of PCa patients. PSA transcripts have not been detected in negative control blood. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a novel, rapid and sensitive assay suitable for the detection of CTCs in peripheral blood of PCa patients.

Xenoestrogens are environmental estrogens that have endocrine impact, acting as both estrogen agonists and antagonists, but whose effects are not well characterized. In this investigation we sought to delineate effects of xenoestrogens. Using human cervical cancer cells (HeLa cells) as a model, the effects of representative xenoestrogens (Coumestrol-a phytoestrogen, tetrachlorodioxin (TCDD)-a herbicide and DDT-a pesticide) on proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis were examined. These xenoestrogens and estrogen inhibited the proliferation of Hela cells in a dose dependent manner from 20 to 120 nM suggesting, that 17-beta-estrtadiol and xenoestrogens induced cytotoxic effects. Coumestrol produced accumulation of HeLa cells in G2/M phase, and subsequently induced apoptosis. Similar effects were observed in estrogen treated cells. These changes were associated with suppressed bcl-2 protein and augmented Cyclins A and D proteins. DDT and TCDD exposure did not induce apoptosis. These preliminary data taken together, suggest that xenoestrogens have direct, compound-specific effects on HeLa cells.

Soy isoflavones possesses chemical structure similar to endogenous estrogen and may promote the carcinogenesis of breast cancer. This study was to investigate the relationship between the polymorphism of COMT, soy isoflavones, and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Methods: In total, 176 patients newly diagnosed histopathologically with breast cancer were recruited from May 2007 to July 2009, and 176 age-matched cancer-free women as controls were selected from a community-based physical check-up population at the same period. The food-frequency questionnaire was used to collect information on soy food intake. Allelespecific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) was employed to analyze genetic polymorphism VaU58Met of COMT. Adjusted odd ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence Intervals (95% CI) were estimated by multivariable nonconditional logistic regression. Results: The proportion of susceptible genotype (COMT-LL) in breast cancer patients was significantly higher than that in the controls. After adjusting selected risk factors, the aOR and 95% CI of COMT-LL were 3.14 (1.48-6.66) as compared with those of COMT-HH genotype. The intake of soy isoflavones had a negative correlation with breast cancer in a dose-dependent manner (X2=28.26, P<0.001). The women with high intake of soy isoflavones (> 16.26 mg/d) and carrying susceptible genotype (COMT-LL), as compared with the women carrying the COMT-HH+COMT-HL genotypes and consuming low level of soy isoflavones (> 16.26 mg/d), had no significantly increased risk for breast cancer [ aOR (95% CI)=1.66(0.52-5.24)]. Conclusions: In postmenopausal women, carrying COMT-LL genotype may increase the risk for breast cancer, and soy isoflavones intake may protect them from breast cancer.

"1029","923"," D. Chen, Q. P. Dou","The ubiquitin-proteasome system as a prospective molecular target for cancer treatment and prevention","Proteasomes are large multicatalytic proteinase complexes located in the cytosol and the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for the degradation of most intracellular proteins and therefore plays an essential regulatory role in critical cellular processes including cell cycle progression, proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Besides involving in normal cellular functions and homeostasis, the alteration of proteasomal activity contributes to the pathological states of several clinical disorders including inflammation, neurodegeneration and cancer. It has been reported that human cancer cells possess elevated level of proteasome activity and are more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than normal cells, indicating that the inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system could be used as a novel approach for cancer therapy. In this review we summarize several specific aspects of research for the proteasome complex, including the structure and catalytic activities of the proteasome, properties and mechanisms of action of various proteasome inhibitors, and finally the clinical development of proteasome inhibitors as novel anticancer agents. 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"acute granulocytic leukemia/dt [Drug Therapy] advanced cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] antiangiogenic activity antineoplastic activity apoptosis arthralgia/si [Side Effect] article asthenia/si [Side Effect] blood toxicity/si [Side Effect] bone marrow suppression/si [Side Effect] breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *cancer chemotherapy cancer combination chemotherapy *cancer prevention cancer resistance cancer survival carcinogenesis cell cycle regulation cell metabolism chemosensitization chemotherapy induced emesis/si [Side Effect] colon tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] crystal structure decreased appetite/si [Side Effect] diarrhea/si [Side Effect] dizziness/si [Side Effect] drug effect drug efficacy drug eruption/si [Side Effect] drug induced headache/si [Side Effect] drug mechanism drug penetration drug targeting dyspnea/si [Side Effect] enzyme activity enzyme structure enzyme substrate complex erythropenia/si [Side Effect] face edema/si [Side Effect] fatigue/si [Side Effect] gastrointestinal symptom/si [Side Effect] hand edema/si [Side Effect] hematologic malignancy/dt [Drug Therapy] herpes zoster/si [Side Effect] human infection/si [Side Effect] insomnia/si [Side Effect] kidney carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] leukopenia/si [Side Effect] lung cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] lung non small cell cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] mantle cell lymphoma/dt [Drug Therapy] mesothelioma/dt [Drug Therapy] *molecularly targeted therapy multiple myeloma/dr [Drug Resistance] multiple myeloma/dt [Drug Therapy] multiple myeloma/pc [Prevention] myalgia/si [Side Effect] nausea/si [Side Effect] neuroblastoma/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhodgkin lymphoma/dt [Drug Therapy] nonhuman paresthesia/si [Side Effect] peripheral edema/si [Side Effect] peripheral neuropathy/si [Side Effect] prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] protein degradation protein function proteinase inhibition signal transduction single drug dose skin tingling/si [Side Effect] solid tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] tea thrombocytopenia/si [Side Effect] tumor vascularization ubiquitination weakness/si [Side Effect] anaphase promoting complex/ec [Endogenous Compound] antineoplastic agent/cb [Drug Combination] antineoplastic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] arsenic trioxide/cb [Drug Combination] arsenic trioxide/cm [Drug Comparison] ascorbic acid/cb [Drug Combination] ascorbic acid/it [Drug Interaction] benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal/pk [Pharmacokinetics] benzyloxycarbonylleucylleucylleucinal/pd [Pharmacology] bortezomib/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] bortezomib/ct [Clinical Trial] bortezomib/cb [Drug Combination] bortezomib/cm [Drug Comparison] bortezomib/it [Drug Interaction] bortezomib/dt [Drug Therapy] bortezomib/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] bortezomib/pd [Pharmacology] cullin/ec [Endogenous Compound] curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] cyclin dependent kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination] cyclophosphamide/cm [Drug Comparison] dexamethasone/cb [Drug Combination] dexamethasone/cm [Drug Comparison] docetaxel/cb [Drug Combination] docetaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] doxorubicin/cm [Drug Comparison] epicatechin/dv [Drug Development] epicatechin/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin/dv [Drug Development] epigallocatechin/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin gallate/dv [Drug Development] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] F box protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] flavonoid/cb [Drug Combination] flavonoid/it [Drug Interaction] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] gliotoxin/dv [Drug Development] gliotoxin/pd [Pharmacology] lactacystin/dv [Drug Development] lactacystin/pd [Pharmacology] melphalan/cb [Drug Combination] melphalan/cm [Drug Comparison] *proteasome/ec [Endogenous Compound] *proteasome inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] salinosporamide A/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] salinosporamide A/ct [Clinical Trial] salinosporamide A/cm [Drug Comparison] salinosporamide A/dt [Drug Therapy] salinosporamide A/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] salinosporamide A/pd [Pharmacology] thalidomide/cb [Drug Combination] thalidomide/cm [Drug Comparison] *ubiquitin/ec [Endogenous Compound] ubiquitin protein ligase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","459-470","11","2010",-1

Calvo","Use of transgenic mice as models for prostate cancer chemoprevention","Prostate cancer is a long latency type of tumor that usually develops in men older than 50 years of age. Prostate epithelial neoplasia (PIN), the initial malignant lesion, progresses to invasive carcinoma over the course of years. Because of the particular features of prostate carcinogenesis, this type of tumor may represent a paradigm for cancer prevention. Several clinical trials have evaluated the effect of different compounds on prostate tumor development, including finasteride, selenium, vitamin E, and carotenes. Although some results are promising, no conclusive data have been achieved as to recommend any of these compounds as preventive agents. Results from some trials, such as SELECT, where supplementation of selenium and/or vitamin-E was used, have been rather disappointing. However, many novel chemopreventive agents that target different cancer-related pathways are being developed lately. Appropriate animal models (in particular, genetically modified mice) are being used to assess the efficacy of these novel compounds. The transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model has been validated as an accurate model to test a variety of preventive agents. Genistein, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, toremifene, R-flurbiprofen, celecoxib, and green tea polyphenols have been shown to prevent prostate cancer development in TRAMP mice. In conclusion, new chemopreventive compounds which are effective in animal models are likely to be tested soon in clinical trials, with the final goal of reducing prostate cancer incidence in men. 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"alopecia/si [Side Effect] animal model article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer cell cancer prevention cancer risk carcinogenesis cardiovascular disease/si [Side Effect] cell cycle arrest cell growth chemoprophylaxis dermatitis/si [Side Effect] diabetes mellitus/si [Side Effect] diet supplementation double blind procedure drug targeting drug tolerability genotoxicity/si [Side Effect] human low drug dose multicenter study (topic) nonhuman prostate biopsy *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] *prostate cancer/si [Side Effect] randomized controlled trial (topic) sexual dysfunction/si [Side Effect] tea *transgenic mouse xenograft *alpha tocopherol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *alpha tocopherol/cb [Drug Combination] *alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] *alpha tocopherol/pd [Pharmacology] beta carotene/dt [Drug Therapy] celecoxib/cb [Drug Combination] celecoxib/dt [Drug Therapy] celecoxib/pd [Pharmacology] cyclooxygenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *dutasteride/dt [Drug Therapy] eflornithine/dt [Drug Therapy] eflornithine/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen *finasteride/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *finasteride/dt [Drug Therapy] *finasteride/pd [Pharmacology] flurbiprofen/dt [Drug Therapy] flurbiprofen/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/cb [Drug Combination] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/cr [Drug Concentration] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent/dt [Drug Therapy] *nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent/pd [Pharmacology] placebo polyphenol/cb [Drug Combination] polyphenol/dt [Drug Therapy] polyphenol/po [Oral Drug Administration] rofecoxib/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *selenium/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *selenium/cb [Drug Combination] *selenium/dt [Drug Therapy] selenoprotein P/ec [Endogenous Compound] silymarin/dt [Drug Therapy] silymarin/pd [Pharmacology] steroid 5alpha reductase/ec [Endogenous Compound] tamoxifen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] testosterone toremifene/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] toremifene/dt [Drug Therapy] toremifene/pd [Pharmacology] tyrosine kinase receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] vitamin D/cb [Drug Combination] vitamin D/cm [Drug Comparison] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/pd [Pharmacology]","705-718","10","2010",-1

Urine samples were analyzed for genistein, daidzein, equol (isoflavones), and enterolactone (lignan) among newly diagnosed cases (n = 175) and controls (n = 194). Urinary concentrations of enterolactone (lignan) were higher among cases. There were no significant differences in median concentrations of isoflavone excretion. Compared with non-producers of equol (reference tertile), men who produced equol were at decreased risk of total prostate cancer (tertile 2: OR, 0.42; CI, 0.23-0.75) (tertile 3: OR, 0.48; CI, 0.26-0.87) (p trend, 0.020) and high-grade disease (tertile 2: OR, 0.31; CI, 0.15-0.61) (tertile 3: OR, 0.29; CI, 0.13-0.60) (p trend, 0.001). Higher concentrations of enterolactone were positively related to total prostate cancer (OR, 1.85; CI, 1.01-3.44; p trend, 0.027) as well as high-grade disease (OR, 2.46; CI, 1.11-5.46; p trend, 0.023). There were no associations between urinary excretion of genistein and daidzein with risk of prostate cancer.

Abbas","The role of medicinal herbs in angiogenesis related diseases","Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels from existing one, is essential in normal growth processes. Uncontrolled angiogenesis is a main contributor to a number of disease states such as asthma, AIDS, bacterial infections, autoimmune disease, cirrhosis, diabetes, obesity, multiple sclerosis and endometriosis, Angiogenesis also considered a key step in tumour growth, invasion and metastasis. Angiogenesis is required for suitable nourishment and removal of metabolic wastes from tumour sites. Therefore, modulation of angiogenesis is considered as therapeutic strategies of great importance for human health. Numerous bioactive plant extracts are recently tested for their anti-angiogenic potential. Among the most frequently studied are plants rich with polyphenols and terpens present in fruits, vegetables and other plants which have high antioxidant compounds. Plant polyphenols inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis through regulation of multiple signaling pathways. Specifically, flavonoids regulate expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and inhibit nuclear factor _B (NF_B), phosphatidylinosito 1-3-kinase (PI3-K/Akt) and Extra Cellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways, thereby causing strong anti-angiogenic effects.

Methods: LCL which was prepared with HSPC, cholesterol, DSPE-PEG2000 and DSPE-PEG-MAL was modified with an RGD motif confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The encapsulation efficiency of RGD-M-LCL was also detected by HPLC. MTT assay was used to examine the effects of RGD-M-LCL on the proliferation of Bcap-37, HT-29 and A375 cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells and morphological changes in Bcap-37 cells treated with RGD-M-LCL were detected by Annexin-V-FITC/PI affinity assay and observed under light microscope, respectively. Results: Spherical or oval single-chamber particles of uniform sizes with little agglutination or adhesion were observed under transmission electronic microscope. The RGD motif was successfully coupled to the DSPE-PEG-MAL on liposomes, as confirmed by HPLC. An encapsulation efficiency of 83.13% was obtained when the drug-lipid molar ratio was 0.1, and the encapsulation efficiency was negatively related to the drug-lipid ratio in the range of 0.1~0.4, and to the duration of storage. We found that, compared with free matrine, RGD-M-LCL had much stronger in vitro activity, leading to anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against cancer cells (P<0.01). Conclusion: RGD-M-LCL, a novel delivery system for anti-cancer drugs, was successfully prepared, and we demonstrated that the use of this material could augment the effects of matrine on cancer cells in vitro.

Gutkowska","Cardiac oxytocin receptor blockade stimulates adverse cardiac remodeling in ovariectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats","An increasing amount of evidence demonstrates the beneficial role of oxytocin (OT) in the cardiovascular system. Similar actions are attributed to genistein, an isoflavonic phytoestrogen. The treatment with genistein activates the OT system in the aorta of ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low doses of genistein on the OT-induced effects in rat hypertension. The hypothesis tested was that treatment of OVX spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) with genistein improves heart structure and heart work through a mechanism involving the specific OT receptor (OTR). OVX SHRs or SD rats were treated with genistein (in mug/g body wt sc, 10 days) in the presence or absence of an OT antagonist (OTA) [d(CH 2)5, Tyr(Me)2, Orn8]-vasotocin or a nonspecific estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI-182780). Vehicle-treated OVX rats served as controls. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that left ventricular (LV) OTR, downregulated by ovariectomy, increased in response to genistein. In SHRs or SD rats, this effect was blocked by OTA or ICI-182780 administration. The OTR was mainly localized in microvessels expressing the CD31 marker and colocalized with endothelial nitric oxide synthase. In SHRs, the genistein-stimulated OTR increases were associated with improved fractional shortening, decreased blood pressure (12 mmHg), decreased heart weight-to-body weight ratio, decreased fibrosis, and lowered brain natriuretic peptide in the LV. The prominent finding of the study is the detrimental effect of OTA treatment on the LV of SHRs. OTA treatment of OVX SHRs resulted in a dramatic worsening of ejection fractions and an augmented fibrosis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that cardiac OTRs are involved in the regulation of cardiac function of OVX SHRs. The decreases of OTRs may contribute to cardiac pathology following menopause.

We administered a food frequency questionnaire by face-to-face interview to assess the intake of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted for potential confounders. Comparing the highest to lowest intake quartiles, the adjusted ORs for daidzein were 1.94 (95% CI = 1.20-3.32) and 2.18 (95% CI = 1.28-3.73) for ER positive and PR positive tumors, respectively, in premenopausal patients. The ORs for both ER and PR positive status combined were 2.48 (95% CI = 1.37-4.49) for daidzein and 1.94 (95% CI = 1.21-3.14) for genistein in premenopausal patients with statistically significant tests for trend. There was little or no evidence of associations in postmenopausal patients. We conclude that higher intake of daidzein and genistein before diagnosis was associated with ER and PR positive status in premenopausal Chinese women with breast cancer. The association might confer a more favorable prognosis.

Early intervention correlates with nearly 100% patient survival, but greater than 80% mortality is associated with advanced disease. Currently, few treatment options are available for patients with metastatic melanoma, and the global incidence of melanoma is increasing faster than that of other cancers. Therefore, it is vitally important to uncover and use genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms at work during the development and progression of melanoma for better prevention, diagnosis, and clinical management. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a set of small, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs that target the 3'-untranslated region of an estimated 30% of all human genes to inhibit their expression. Our understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation of cancers has grown immensely over the past decade. Here we review currently available data on melanoma-associated miRNAs, highlighting those deregulated miRNAs targeting important genes and signaling pathways involved in the progression of melanocytes to primary and metastatic melanoma. Understanding the important roles of miRNAs in melanoma progression and metastasis development will contribute to the development of miRNA-targeted therapy in the future.

Further, effect modification by intake of isoflavones and alcohol-induced facial flushing, which are prevalent in Asian populations, have not been investigated. We investigated the association between alcohol intake and breast cancer risk and whether the association is modified by these factors among 50,757 premenopausal and postmenopausal women (aged 40-69 years) in the population-based Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Alcohol consumption and other related factors were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Through to the end of 2006, 572 patients were identified. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by hazard ratios derived from Cox proportional hazards regression models. Compared with never-drinkers, regular alcohol drinkers (>150 g of ethanol/week) had a higher risk of the development of breast cancer; the multivariable-adjusted RRs were 1.75 (95% CI = 1.16-2.65; ptrend 5 0.035) for overall, 1.78 (95% CI = 1.09-2.90) for premenopausal and 1.21 (95% CI = 0.53-2.75) for postmenopausal women.

Horie","Combined inhibitory effects of soy isoflavones and curcumin on the production of prostate-specific antigen","BACKGROUND. Sustained chronic inflammation in the prostate promotes prostate carcinogenesis. Since an elevated level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) per se reflects the presence of inflammation in the prostate, intervention to improve the PSA value might potentially have beneficial effects for the prevention of the development of prostate cancer. Isoflavones and curcumin have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. We examined the biological effects of soy isoflavones and curcumin on LNCaP cells. After that, we conducted a clinical trial for men who received prostate biopsies, but were not found to have prostate cancer, to evaluate the effects of soy isoflavones and curcumin on serum PSA levels. METHODS. The expression of androgen receptor and PSA were examined in LNCaP cells before and after treatment of isoflavones and/or curcumin. Eighty-five participants were randomized to take a supplement containing isoflavones and curcumin or placebo daily in a double-blind study. Subjects were subdivided by the cut-off of their baseline PSA value at 10 mg/ml. We evaluated values of PSA before and 6 months after treatment. RESULTS. The production of PSA were markedly decreased by the combined treatment of isoflavones and curcumin in prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. The expression of the androgen receptor was also suppressed by the treatment. In clinical trials, PSA levels decreased in the patients group with PSA>10 treated with supplement containing isoflavones and curcumin (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Our results indicated that isoflavones and curcumin could modulate serum PSA levels. Curcumin presumably synergizes with isoflavones to suppress PSA production in prostate cells through the anti-androgen effects. 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"adult aged antiinflammatory activity antioxidant activity article blood level *cancer prevention cell strain LNCaP clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study double blind procedure drug effect human immunoblotting major clinical study male priority journal *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] protein expression randomized controlled trial statistical analysis androgen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *curcumin/ct [Clinical Trial] *curcumin/cb [Drug Combination] *curcumin/it [Drug Interaction] *curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] *curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/cb [Drug Combination] *isoflavone/it [Drug Interaction] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] placebo *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1127-1133","70","2010",-1

Kaplan","Women gynecologists' attitude toward their own health","Background: Following the publication of the results of Women's Health Initiative in 2002 there have been gross changes in the attitude of women and physicians towards the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). We evaluated the attitude of women gynecologist towards their own health, including adherence to recommended screening tests and self usage and prescription of hormone replacement therapy. Material/Methods: Questionnaires regarding performance of screening tests, self usage and recommendation of HRT were posted by mail to all Israel's women gynecologists. Results: Ninety questionnaires were eligible for analysis (43.2% response rate). Average age was 48+7.7 years. Only 7/90 (7.8%) gynecologists smoke regularly and average body mass index was 25+3.8 kg/m2. Most participants performed at least one screening tests in the past 2 years. The median interval from the last self breast exam, mammography, gynecologisy exam, Papanicolaou test, colonoscopy and bone density test was 0.2, 1.82, 1.79, 1.95, 3.27 and 1.41 years, respectively. Most of them (68.3%) did not routinely recommend HRT to their patients. The duration of self HRT usage ranged between 1-20 years (average 5.1+3.4 years). Most gynecologists (87.7%) recommended continuous estrogen and progesterone for women with their uterus in place. Conclusions: The health profile of Israeli women gynecologists is chracterized by a high performance of screening tests for cancer and low rate of smoking. Our study also demonstrates that the impact of the results of the WHI trial is still well manifested and most Israeli women gynecologists do not routinely recommend HRT to postmenopausal women.

The current study aimed to (1) describe communication patterns between oncologists and breast cancer patients regarding the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and (2) assess the relationship between CAM discussions and anxiety levels. Methods. Interaction analysis of audiotaped initial consultations of 102 early-stage breast cancer patients with Australian and New Zealand oncologists was carried out. Preconsultation and postconsultation anxiety levels were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results. At least 1 instance of CAM discussion was found in 24 of the 102 consultations (24%). CAM discussions were mainly patient initiated (73%). The most common doctor's response to a patient's mention of CAM was encouragement (38%), although 23% of CAM references elicited a discouraging comment, and 20% were ignored. No patient demographics were significantly associated with CAM discussion. Patients who discussed CAM reported higher preconsultation and postconsultation anxiety levels than those who did not discuss CAM. Conclusions. CAM discussions during initial consultations between early-stage breast cancer patients and oncologists appear to be limited and linked with higher patient anxiety before and after the consultation. These findings indicate that doctors require further education about CAM therapies and supplements as well as guidance in how to raise and effectively discuss CAM issues with concern for their safety while balancing respect for the patients' beliefs.

Marques","Bioactive chromone derivatives - structural diversity","Chromones (1-benzopyran-4-ones) and chromone derivatives are naturally occurring compounds ubiquitously found in the plant kingdom, and therefore present in representative amounts in a normal human diet. These phytochemicals possess a wide spectrum of biological activities - such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumour and anticancer - mainly due to their well-recognised antioxidant properties, which stem from their ability to neutralise active forms of oxygen and to cut off free radical processes. Since oxidative stress is known to be the basis for numerous severe pathologies, from cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders to cancer, the development of effective antioxidant agents from natural origin (namely dietary constituents) has been the object of vigorous research in the last decade, in view of establishing novel chemopreventive strategies against such diseases which are nowadays the main cause of death worldwide. In fact, the chromone moiety is an important element of pharmacophores of many biologically active molecules displaying diverse medicinal applications. These potential health benefits arising from the antioxidant activity of chromone derivatives are ruled by strict structureactivity/structure-property relationships, which, apart from determining their biological action, modulate their systemic distribution and bioavailability in sites of oxidation within the cell. The present work aims at reviewing the main reported studies on the cytoprotective and anticancer activities of chromone derivatives, with particular emphasis on the effect of their structural features and conformational behaviour on activity, which is the basis of a tailored design of novel chromone-based antioxidants for chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic use. 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"antiangiogenic activity antifungal activity antiinflammatory activity antimicrobial activity antineoplastic activity antiviral activity apoptosis article bacterial infection biological activity breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer inhibition cell cycle arrest cell protection chemoprophylaxis clinical trial colon cancer colorectal cancer degenerative disease diabetes mellitus DNA fragmentation drug activity drug binding drug conformation drug structure human Huntington disease like syndrome immunostimulation larynx cancer mouth cancer nonhuman ovary cancer pharynx cancer priority journal promyelocytic leukemia psychosis 2 phenyl chromone/pd [Pharmacology] 2 styrylchromone/pd [Pharmacology] aloesin/pd [Pharmacology] alpha tocopherol antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] antioxidant/pd [Pharmacology] ascorbic acid baicalein/pd [Pharmacology] carotenoid chromanone a/pd [Pharmacology] *chromone derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *chromone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] eugenitine/pd [Pharmacology] eugenitol/pd [Pharmacology] flavopiridol/ct [Clinical Trial] flavopiridol/an [Drug Analysis] flavopiridol/it [Drug Interaction] flavopiridol/pd [Pharmacology] hydrocortisone hyperimone a/an [Drug Analysis] hyperimone a/pd [Pharmacology] hyperimone b/an [Drug Analysis] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] nimesulide nobiletin/an [Drug Analysis] nobiletin/pd [Pharmacology] noduliprevenone/pd [Pharmacology] paclitaxel/ct [Clinical Trial] paclitaxel/it [Drug Interaction] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] polyphenol/pd [Pharmacology] retinol styrylchromone/pd [Pharmacology] tangeretin/an [Drug Analysis] tangeretin/pd [Pharmacology] uncinoside A/pd [Pharmacology] uncinoside B/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug zapotin/an [Drug Analysis] zapotin/pd [Pharmacology]","76-89","6","2010",-1

Studies with indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its dimeric product, 3, 3'-diindolylmethane (DIM), have indicated efficacy of these compounds against a number of human cancers. Available as well as emerging data suggests that these compounds act on a number of cellular signaling pathways leading to their observed biological effects. Such pleiotropic effects of these compounds are also considered crucial for their chemosensitization activity wherein they help reduce the toxicity and resistance against conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. These observations have major clinical implications especially in chemotherapy. Through this review, we have attempted to update current understanding on the state of anti- cancer research involving indole compounds. We have also summarized the available literature on modulatory effects of indoles on molecular targets such as survivin, uPA/uPAR and signaling pathways such as the NF- B pathway, which are important for the apoptosis-inducing and chemosensitizing properties of these compounds. 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"absence of side effects/si [Side Effect] antineoplastic activity antioxidant activity *apoptosis article bone metastasis/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] breast tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] breast tumor/pc [Prevention] cancer cell culture cancer combination chemotherapy cancer inhibition cancer research cancer resistance cancer risk cell cycle arrest cell cycle regulation chemoprophylaxis chemosensitization clinical trial colon cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] colon tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] colorectal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] dietary intake dose response drug absorption drug dose increase drug efficacy drug potentiation drug safety drug tolerability human larynx papillomatosis/dt [Drug Therapy] larynx papillomatosis/pc [Prevention] liver cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] lung cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] lung cancer/pc [Prevention] monotherapy nonhuman pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] pleiotropy prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] signal transduction stomach cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] uterine cervix cancer/pc [Prevention] *3 indolemethanol/ct [Clinical Trial] *3 indolemethanol/cb [Drug Combination] *3 indolemethanol/do [Drug Dose] *3 indolemethanol/it [Drug Interaction] *3 indolemethanol/dt [Drug Therapy] *3 indolemethanol/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *3 indolemethanol/po [Oral Drug Administration] *3 indolemethanol/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *3 indolemethanol/pd [Pharmacology] *3,3' diindolylmethane/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *3,3' diindolylmethane/ct [Clinical Trial] *3,3' diindolylmethane/cb [Drug Combination] *3,3' diindolylmethane/it [Drug Interaction] *3,3' diindolylmethane/dt [Drug Therapy] *3,3' diindolylmethane/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *3,3' diindolylmethane/pd [Pharmacology] butyric acid/cb [Drug Combination] butyric acid/it [Drug Interaction] butyric acid/pd [Pharmacology] cisplatin/cb [Drug Combination] cisplatin/it [Drug Interaction] cisplatin/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] docetaxel/cb [Drug Combination] docetaxel/it [Drug Interaction] docetaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] docetaxel/pd [Pharmacology] doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] doxorubicin/it [Drug Interaction] doxorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] erlotinib/cb [Drug Combination] erlotinib/it [Drug Interaction] erlotinib/dt [Drug Therapy] erlotinib/pd [Pharmacology] gemcitabine/cb [Drug Combination] gemcitabine/it [Drug Interaction] gemcitabine/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/it [Drug Interaction] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] oxaliplatin/cb [Drug Combination] oxaliplatin/it [Drug Interaction] oxaliplatin/pd [Pharmacology] paclitaxel/cb [Drug Combination] paclitaxel/it [Drug Interaction] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor/it [Drug Interaction] phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] survivin/ec [Endogenous Compound] tamoxifen/cb [Drug Combination] tamoxifen/it [Drug Interaction] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] urokinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] urokinase receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","652-666","11","2010",-1

Among them, isoflavone genistein and curcumin are very promising anti-cancer agents because of their non-toxic and potent anti-cancer properties. However, it is important to note that the low water solubility, poor in vivo bioavailability and unacceptable pharmacokinetic profile of these natural compounds limit their efficacy as anti-cancer agents for solid tumors. Therefore, the development of synthetic analogs of isoflavone and curcumin based on the structure-activity assay, and the encapsulation of isoflavone and curcumin with liposome or nanoparticle for enhancing the anti-tumor activity of these natural agents, is an exciting area of research. Emerging in vitro and in vivo studies clearly suggest that these analogs and formulations of natural compounds could be much more potent for the prevention and/or treatment of various cancers. In this review article, we will summarize the current knowledge regarding the anti-cancer effect of natural compounds and their analogs, the regulation of cell signaling by these agents, and the structure-activity relationship for better design of novel anti-cancer agents, which could open newer avenues for the prevention of tumor progression and/or treatment of human malignancies. 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"adenomatous polyp antiinflammatory activity *antineoplastic activity antioxidant activity apoptosis article biological activity bladder cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] Bowen disease/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer chemotherapy cancer growth cancer prevention cell communication cell proliferation clinical trial colorecetal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] diet drug absorption drug design drug mechanism drug structure gastrointestinal absorption human intestine metaplasia/dt [Drug Therapy] leukoplakia/dt [Drug Therapy] liposomal delivery oxidative stress pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] priority journal prostate cancer protein DNA binding protein phosphorylation signal transduction structure activity relation uterine cervix carcinoma in situ/dt [Drug Therapy] 1,5 diarylpentadienone/an [Drug Analysis] 1,5 diarylpentadienone/dv [Drug Development] 2,4 dimethyl 5 (2 oxo 1h indol 3 ylmethylene) 3 pyrrolepropionic acid/dv [Drug Development] 4 hydroxy 3 methoxybenzoic acid methyl ester/dv [Drug Development] 4 hydroxy 3 methoxybenzoic acid methyl ester/pd [Pharmacology] benzyloxime/dv [Drug Development] biochanin A/dv [Drug Development] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] CDF/dv [Drug Development] CDF/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *curcumin/ct [Clinical Trial] *curcumin/an [Drug Analysis] *curcumin/cm [Drug Comparison] *curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] *curcumin/po [Oral Drug Administration] *curcumin/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein ef 24/dv [Drug Development] flll 11/dv [Drug Development] flll 11/it [Drug Interaction] flll 12/dv [Drug Development] flll 12/it [Drug Interaction] fluoride/dv [Drug Development] fluoride/pk [Pharmacokinetics] genistein/dv [Drug Development] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glycitein go y030/dv [Drug Development] go y030/it [Drug Interaction] hydroxyflutamide/cm [Drug Comparison] I kappa B kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] *isoflavone derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *isoflavone derivative/dv [Drug Development] isoxazole/dv [Drug Development] novasoy phenoxodiol/dv [Drug Development] phenoxodiol/pd [Pharmacology] prostaglandin synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] semaxanib/dv [Drug Development] STAT3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] su 1433/dv [Drug Development] unclassified drug unindexed drug","1801-1812","16","2010",-1

The effects of the root cultures of P. candollei (r-PC) on cytochrome P450 enzymes in mouse liver and antioxidant activity in mouse brain including gross anatomy were examined. r-PC significantly enlarged the uterus length while no change in weight was noted. The total P450 content was not significantly altered by either estradiol benzoate (ES) or r-PC. Benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity was significantly increased by r-PC, comparable to the increase induced by ES. Correspondingly, r-PC demonstrated a tendency to upregulate CYP2B9 mRNA expression. Furthermore, assessment of lipid peroxidation in mouse brain using the thiobarbituric acid assay demonstrated that r-PC remarkably decreased the level of malondealdehyde formation.

This study suggested that G2/M cell cycle arrest was triggered by ROS/NO productions with regulations of p53, p21, cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), Cdc2 and cyclin B1, which were able to be prevented by protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity inhibitor genistein or JNK inhibitor SP600125. The decreased JNK phosphorylation by addition of Ras or Raf inhibitor, as well as the increased cell viability by addition of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), Ras, Raf or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, further demonstrated that the Ras-Raf-JNK pathway was responsible for this PTK-mediated signalling.

S-(2)equol, a ligand for ERbeta, is an intestinally derived metabolite formed by many humans and by rodents consuming diets containing soy isoflavones. Whether the well-documented chemopreventive effect of a soy diet could be explained by equol's action was unclear because neither diastereoisomers had been tested in animal models of chemoprevention. Sprague-Dawley rats (n 5 40-41 per group) were fed a soy-free AIN-93G diet or an AIN-93G diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg of S-(2)equol or R-(1)equol beginning day 35. On day 50, mammary tumors were induced by dimethylbenz[a]anthracene and thereafter, animals were palpated for number and location of tumors. On day 190, animals were killed and mammary tumors were removed and verified by histology, and the degree of invasiveness and differentiation was determined. S-(2)equol and R-(1)equol plasma concentrations measured on days 35, 100 and 190 by tandem mass spectrometry confirmed diet compliance and no biotransformation of either diastereoisomer. In this model, S-(2)equol had no chemopreventive action, nor was it stimulatory. In contrast, R-(1)equol compared with Controls reduced palpable tumors (P = 0.002), resulted in 43% fewer tumors (P = 0.004), increased tumor latency (88.5 versus 66 days, P = 0.003), and tumors were less invasive but showed no difference in pattern grade or mitosis. Both enantiomers had no effect on absolute uterine weight but caused a significant reduction in body weight gain. In conclusion, the novel finding that the unnatural enantiomer, R-(1)equol, was potently chemopreventive warrants investigation of its potential for breast cancer prevention and treatment.

Aggarwal","Sesamin manifests chemopreventive effects through the suppression of NF-B-regulated cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenic gene products","Agents that are safe, affordable, and efficacious are urgently needed for the prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer. Sesamin, a lipid-soluble lignan, is one such agent that belongs to a class of phytoestrogens, isolated from sesame (Sesamum indicum), and has been linked with prevention of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and carcinogenesis through an unknown mechanism. Because the transcription factor NF-B has been associated with inflammation, carcinogenesis, tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis of cancer, we postulated that sesamin might mediate its effect through the modulation of the NF-B pathway. We found that sesamin inhibited the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, pancreas, and lung. Sesamin also potentiated tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced apoptosis and this correlated with the suppression of gene products linked to cell survival (e.g., Bcl-2 and survivin), proliferation (e.g., cyclin D1), inflammation (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2), invasion (e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-9, intercellular adhesion molecule 1), and angiogenesis (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor). Sesamin downregulated constitutive and inducible NF-B activation induced by various inflammatory stimuli and carcinogens, and inhibited the degradation of IBalpha, the inhibitor of NF-B, through the suppression of phosphorylation of IBalpha and inhibition of activation of IBalpha protein kinase, thus resulting in the suppression of p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and NF-B-mediated reporter gene transcription. The inhibition of IBalpha protein kinase activation was found to be mediated through the inhibition of TAK1 kinase. Overall, our results showed that sesamin may have potential against cancer and other chronic diseases through the suppression of a pathway linked to the NF-B signaling. 2010 AACR.",NA,"antiangiogenic activity antineoplastic activity apoptosis article cancer cell cancer invasion carcinogenesis cell proliferation cell survival cell type controlled study down regulation drug effect enzyme activation gene expression genetic transcription human human cell inflammation leukemia cell myeloma cell priority journal protein degradation protein DNA binding protein phosphorylation reporter gene carcinogen cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclooxygenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] gelatinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] gene product/ec [Endogenous Compound] I kappa B alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] I kappa B kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] intercellular adhesion molecule 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *sesamin/dv [Drug Development] *sesamin/pd [Pharmacology] survivin/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor RelA/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor necrosis factor alpha vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","751-761","8","2010",-1

Grain legumes such as soybean, chickpea, pea, lentil, common bean, faba bean or peanut are the main protein source together with cereals in many developing countries. They also form part of the Mediterranean diet and some of them are consumed after microbial fermentation as probiotics. Legumes may be produced in a sustainable way for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with a group of bacteria called rhizobia. In the development of this symbiosis, legume flavonoids play a fundamental role, being excreted by the plant in response to nodulation factors produced by the bacteria. Isoflavones, which are molecules mainly found in legumes, may have beneficial effects on human health, and their use can be of help in the fight against many diseases, including several types of cancer and cardiovascular disorders.

Tolrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor (ARI), is known to be the most potent inhibitor of the enzyme. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effects of other ARIs including flavonoids on AKR1B10 and aldose reductase to evaluate their specificity. However, ARIs showed lower inhibitory potency for AKR1B10 than for aldose reductase. In the search for potent and selective inhibitors of AKR1B10 from other drugs used clinically, we found that non-steroidal antiinflammatory N-phenyl-anthranilic acids, diclofenac and glycyrrhetic acid competitively inhibited AKR1B10, showing Ki values of 0.35-2.9 muM and high selectivity to this enzyme (43-57 fold versus aldose reductase). Molecular docking studies of mefenamic acid and glycyrrhetic acid in the AKR1B10-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) complex and site-directed mutagenesis of the putative binding residues suggest that the side chain of Val301 and a hydrogen-bonding network among residues Val301, Gln114 and Ser304 are important for determining the inhibitory potency and selectivity of the non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Thus, the potent and selective inhibition may be related to the cancer chemopreventive roles of the drugs, and their structural features may facilitate the design of new anti-cancer agents targeting AKR1B10. 2010 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",NA,"*antiinflammatory activity article cancer prevention competitive inhibition complex formation controlled study drug potency drug selectivity drug specificity drug structure drug targeting *enzyme inhibition hydrogen bond IC 50 molecular docking site directed mutagenesis structure activity relation aldehyde reductase/ec [Endogenous Compound] aldose reductase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] chrysin/pd [Pharmacology] diclofenac/pd [Pharmacology] *efenamic acid/pd [Pharmacology] epalrestat/pd [Pharmacology] fenoprofen/pd [Pharmacology] fidarestat/pd [Pharmacology] flufenamic acid/pd [Pharmacology] flurbiprofen/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glutamine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *glycyrrhetinic acid/pd [Pharmacology] ibuprofen/pd [Pharmacology] indometacin/pd [Pharmacology] meclofenamic acid/pd [Pharmacology] mefenamic acid/pd [Pharmacology] minalrestat/pd [Pharmacology] myricetin/pd [Pharmacology] nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate/ec [Endogenous Compound] *protein akr1b10 quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] serine/ec [Endogenous Compound] sulindac/pd [Pharmacology] suprofen/pd [Pharmacology] tolrestat/pd [Pharmacology] *tumor marker unclassified drug unindexed drug valine/ec [Endogenous Compound] zopolrestat/pd [Pharmacology]","886-890","33","2010",-1

Boye","Signal transduction mechanisms involved in S100A4-induced activation of the transcription factor NF-B","Background: The metastasis-promoting protein S100A4 activates the transcription factor NF-B through the classical NF-B activation pathway. The upstream signal transduction mechanisms leading to increased NF-B activity are, however, incompletely characterized.Methods: The human osteosarcoma cell line II-11b was stimulated with recombinant S100A4 in the presence or absence of inhibitors of common signal transduction pathways, and NF-B activity was examined using a luciferase-based reporter assay and phosphorylation of IBalpha. mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, protein expression was examined by Western blotting and IKK activity was measured using an in vitro kinase assay. The role of upstream kinases and the cell surface receptor RAGE was investigated by overexpression of dominant negative proteins and by siRNA transfection.Results: The Ser/Thr kinase inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine inhibited S100A4-induced IBalpha phosphorylation and subsequent NF-B activation. The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and the phospholipase C inhibitor compound 48/80 had a partial inhibitory effect on IBalpha phosphorylation, whereas inhibitors of protein kinase C, G-protein coupled receptors and PI 3-kinases had no effect on the level of phosphorylation. Interestingly, S100A4 treatment induced activating phosphorylations of IKKalpha/beta, but neither H-7 nor staurosporine was able to significantly inhibit IKK activation. Dominant negative MEKK1 or NIK did not inhibit S100A4-induced NF-B activity, and S100A4 stimulation did not influence AKT phosphorylation. Furthermore, diminished expression of the putative S100 protein receptor RAGE did not affect the observed phosphorylation of IBalpha.Conclusions: S100A4 activates NF-B by inducing phosphorylation of IKKalpha/beta, leading to increased IBalpha phosphorylation. The Ser/Thr kinase inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine attenuated S100A4-induced NF-B activation and inhibited IKK-mediated phosphorylation of IBalpha. S100A4-induced NF-B activation was independent of the putative S100 protein receptor RAGE and the Ser/Thr kinases MEKK1, NIK and AKT. These findings lead to increased understanding of S100A4 signaling, which may contribute to the identification of novel targets for anti-metastatic therapy. 2010 Grotterod et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"article cancer cell culture controlled study enzyme assay genetic transfection human human cell immunoprecipitation in vitro study osteosarcoma cell plasmid protein expression protein phosphorylation reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction *signal transduction Western blotting 1 (5 isoquinolinesulfonyl) 2 methylpiperazine advanced glycation end product/ec [Endogenous Compound] *calvasculin compound 48-80 G protein coupled receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein I kappa B alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] I kappa B beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] *immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] luciferase messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase C inhibitor protein S 100/ec [Endogenous Compound] small interfering RNA staurosporine",NA,"10","2010",-1

Our aim was to examine the glycan composition of histiotrophe from first trimester decidua and to compare it with secretions present in endometrial glands from the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Study design: Twenty samples of decidua from pregnancies between 8 and 11 weeks were processed into epoxy resin and sections stained with a panel of 22 lectins, together with six late secretory phase endometrial biopsies. Main outcome measures: Specimens were analysed using a semi-quantitative ranking system and the density of lectin binding to the glandular secretions and the epithelium assessed. Results: With the onset of pregnancy, beta-galactose, alpha-N-acetyl galactosamine and N-Acetyl lactosamine bound by Arachis hypogaea, Glycine max, Helix pomatia and Erythrina crystagalli agglutinins appeared in terminal positions on oligosaccharide chains, suggesting loss of the capping sialic acid residues present in the non-pregnant state. Conclusions: Suppression of terminal sialylation is evident during early pregnancy, suggesting that modifications to endometrial glandular activity occur in response to placental signals. The changes may facilitate absorption of histiotrophe by the trophoblast and enhance availability of substrates for degradation. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

"1091","993"," H. Zhou, Y. Luo, S. Huang","Updates of mTOR inhibitors","Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a central controller of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and angiogenesis. mTOR signaling is often dysregulated in various human diseases and thus attracts great interest in developing drugs that target mTOR. Currently it is known that mTOR functions as two complexes, mTOR complex 1/2 (mTORC1/2). Rapamycin and its analogs (all termed rapalogs) first form a complex with the intracellular receptor FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and then bind a domain separated from the catalytic site of mTOR, blocking mTOR function. Rapalogs are selective for mTORC1 and effective as anticancer agents in various preclinical models. In clinical trials, rapalogs have demonstrated efficacy against certain types of cancer. Recently, a new generation of mTOR inhibitors, which compete with ATP in the catalytic site of mTOR and inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with a high degree of selectivity, have been developed. Besides, some natural products, such as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), caffeine, curcumin and resveratrol, have been found to inhibit mTOR as well. Here, we summarize the current findings regarding mTOR signaling pathway and review the updated data about mTOR inhibitors as anticancer agents. 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"anemia/si [Side Effect] *antineoplastic activity article asthenia/si [Side Effect] breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer cell culture cancer inhibition clinical trial dose response drug activity drug bioavailability drug efficacy drug formulation drug half life drug potentiation drug safety drug stability drug structure drug tolerability fatigue/si [Side Effect] glioblastoma/dt [Drug Therapy] human kidney carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] lung cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] mantle cell lymphoma/dt [Drug Therapy] melanoma/dt [Drug Therapy] mucosa inflammation/si [Side Effect] neuroendocrine tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] neutropenia/si [Side Effect] nonhuman pancreas tumor/dt [Drug Therapy] pneumonia/si [Side Effect] rash/si [Side Effect] stomatitis/si [Side Effect] thrombocytopenia/si [Side Effect] 1 (1 cyano 1 methylethyl) 3 methyl 8 (3 quinolinyl)imidazo[4,5 c]quinolin 2(1h,3h) one/cb [Drug Combination] 1 (1 cyano 1 methylethyl) 3 methyl 8 (3 quinolinyl)imidazo[4,5 c]quinolin 2(1h,3h) one/do [Drug Dose] 1 (1 cyano 1 methylethyl) 3 methyl 8 (3 quinolinyl)imidazo[4,5 c]quinolin 2(1h,3h) one/pd [Pharmacology] 2 (4 hydroxyphenyl) 4 morpholinopyrido[3',2':4,5]furo[3,2 d]pyrimidine 3,3' diindolylmethane 32 deoxy rapamycin/dv [Drug Development] 32 deoxy rapamycin/pd [Pharmacology] bortezomib/cb [Drug Combination] caffeine curcumin deforolimus/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] deforolimus/an [Drug Analysis] deforolimus/pd [Pharmacology] doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] epigallocatechin gallate everolimus/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] everolimus/an [Drug Analysis] everolimus/dt [Drug Therapy] everolimus/po [Oral Drug Administration] everolimus/pk [Pharmacokinetics] everolimus/pd [Pharmacology] genistein gne 477 ku 0063794 mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] melphalan/cb [Drug Combination] pp 242 pp 30 rapamycin resveratrol sar 943 temsirolimus/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] temsirolimus/ct [Clinical Trial] temsirolimus/an [Drug Analysis] temsirolimus/do [Drug Dose] temsirolimus/dt [Drug Therapy] temsirolimus/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] temsirolimus/pd [Pharmacology] torin1 unclassified drug way 600 wjd 008 wye 345 wye 687 xl 765 zotarolimus/dv [Drug Development] zotarolimus/pd [Pharmacology]","571-581","10","2010",-1

Aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of genistein and daidzein, in combination, on immunoexpression pattern of ER, PR and HER2/neu receptors during 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced mammary carcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats. A single subcutaneous injection of DMBA (25 mg/rat) in the mammary gland developed mammary carcinoma in rats. Mammary tissues of control and experimental rats were routinely processed and paraffin embedded, 2-3mum sections were cut in a rotary microtome and mounted on clean glass slides. Immunohistochemical staining of mammary tissue was performed and each slide was micro-scopically analyzed and enumerated for the percentage of the positively stained cells semi-quantitatively and grading was then made. Immunohistochemical analysis showed over expression of ER, PR and HER2/neu in the mammary tissues of DMBA treated rats. Oral administration of genistein+daidzein (20mg+20mg/kg body weight) in combination, to DMBA treated rats significantly prevented the over expression of ER, PR and HER2/neu in the mammary tissues. Genistein and daidzein inhibited mammary epithelial cell proliferation probably by preventing the over expression of ER, PR and HER2/neu in the mammary tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats, during DMBA in-duced mammary carcinogenesis.

A human pilot study showed increased apoptosis after consumption of rye bran bread. In this study, we investigated the effect of high intake of rye whole grain and bran on prostate cancer progression as assessed by PSA concentration in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Seventeen participants were provided with 485 g rye whole grain and bran products (RP) or refined wheat products with added cellulose (WP), corresponding to ~50% of daily energy intake, in a randomized controlled, crossover design. Blood samples were taken from fasting men before and after 2, 4, and 6 wk of treatment and 24-h urine samples were collected before the first intervention period and after treatment. Plasma total PSA concentrations were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP, with a mean treatment effect of -14% (P = 0.04). Additionally, fasting plasma insulin and 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP (P<0.01 and P=0.01, respectively). Daily excretion of 5 lignans was higher after the RP treatment than after the WP treatment (P<0.001). We conclude that whole grain and bran from rye resulted in significantly lower plasma PSA compared with a cellulose-supplemented refined wheat diet in patients with prostate cancer. The effect may be related to inhibition of prostate cancer progression caused by decreased exposure to insulin, as indicated by plasma insulin and urinary C-peptide excretion. 2010 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"aged article blood sampling *bran caloric intake cancer growth clinical article controlled study diet restriction excretion *food intake human inflammation *insulin blood level male *prostate cancer protein urine level *rye urinalysis *wheat *C peptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] C reactive protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] cellulose glucose/ec [Endogenous Compound] *insulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] phytoestrogen *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","2180-2186","140","2010",-1

The treatment group consumed a supplement containing 450 mg genistein, 300 mg daidzein, and other isoflavones daily for 6 mo. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured in both groups at baseline, 3 mo, and 6 mo, and serum concentrations of genistein, daidzein, and equol were assessed at baseline and 6 mo in the treatment group. Following the completion of the 6-mo double-blind study, men were enrolled in a 6-mo open label trial with the same isoflavone-rich supplement, and PSA was measured at 3 and 6 mo. PSA concentrations did not change in either group after 6 mo or after 12 mo when the open-label study was included. The 6 mo serum concentrations of genistein and daidzein (39.85 and 45.59 mumol/l, respectively) were significantly greater than baseline values and substantially higher than levels previously reported in other studies. Equol levels did not change. Although high amounts of aglycone isoflavones may result in significantly elevated serum concentrations of genistein and daidzein, these dietary supplements alone did not lower PSA levels in men with low-volume prostate cancer.

With the recently published results of the reduce (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) trial, interest in this topic is at a peak. Primary pca prevention will be unlikely to affect mortality significantly, but the reduction in overtreatment and the effect on quality of life from the avoidance of a cancer diagnosis are important factors to consider. This review provides a comparative update on the reduce and pcpt trials and some clinical recommendations. Other potential primary preventive strategies with statins, selective estrogen response modulators, and nutraceutical compounds-including current evidence for these agents and their roles in clinical practice-are discussed.

In further in vitro studies, the glyceollin mixture exhibits potential antiestrogenic, therapeutic activity preventing estrogen-stimulated tumorigenesis and displaying a differential pattern of gene expression from tamoxifen. By isolating the individual glyceollin isomers, we identified the active antiestrogenic component using competition binding assays with human ERalpha and estrogen-responsive element-based luciferase reporter assays. We identified glyceollin I as the active antiestrogenic component of the mixture. Ligand-receptor modeling (docking) of the isomers within the ERalpha ligand binding cavity demonstrated a unique type II antiestrogenic confirmation adopted by glyceollin I, but not isomers II and III. Glyceollin I treatment in 17beta- estradiol-stimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cells and BG-1 ovarian cancer cells resulted in a novel inhibition of ER-mediated gene expression and cell proliferation/survival.

Capsanthin and capsorubin, carotenoids iso-lated from paprika, were identified as potent P-gp inhibitors, while lycopene, lutein, antheraxanthin and violaxanthin induced moderate effects. Among flavonoids, effective modulators were rotenone, chrysin, phloretin and sakuranetin. Some chloroform extracts of Chinese herbs were also found to inhibit MDR efflux pumps. The effects of the modulators on P-gp activity were studied by measuring rhodamine 123 uptake in several cancer cells such as the human MDR1 gene-transfected mouse lymphoma cells (L1210) and human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 expressing the MRP1 pump (HTB26). Additionally, the ability to alter biophysical properties of lipid bilayers by selected carotenoids was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The antiproliferative effects as well as the MDR reversal activity of the studied compounds, applied in combination with anticancer drugs, were also discussed. 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"aconitum carmichaeli animal cell article asarum heteropoides Asparagus cochinchinensis Astragalus membranaceus atractylodes macrocephala cancer cell culture Chinese herb Chinese medicine differential scanning calorimetry drug effect drug mechanism gene expression genetic transfection Glehnia littoralis human human cell Ligustrum ligustrum lucidum lymphoma cell mouse *multidrug resistance nonhuman Paris polyphylla *plant product Poria Poria cocos protein expression Selaginella doederleinii antheraxantin/cm [Drug Comparison] antheraxantin/pd [Pharmacology] Astragalus membranaceus extract/pd [Pharmacology] Atractylodes macrocephala extract/pd [Pharmacology] capsaicin/pd [Pharmacology] capsorubin/cm [Drug Comparison] capsorubin/pd [Pharmacology] carotenoid/cm [Drug Comparison] carotenoid/pd [Pharmacology] chrysin/cm [Drug Comparison] chrysin/pd [Pharmacology] dihydrorobinetin dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine epigallocatechin/pd [Pharmacology] flavonoid fustin glehnia littoralis extract/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavonoid kaempferol Ligustrum lucidum extract/pd [Pharmacology] lycopene/cm [Drug Comparison] lycopene/pd [Pharmacology] multidrug resistance protein *natural product/pd [Pharmacology] neohesperidin/pd [Pharmacology] phloretin/cm [Drug Comparison] phloretin/pd [Pharmacology] phlorizin robinetin robinin rotenone/cm [Drug Comparison] rotenone/pd [Pharmacology] sakuranetin/cm [Drug Comparison] sakuranetin/pd [Pharmacology] taxifolin/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug violaxanthin/cm [Drug Comparison] violaxanthin/pd [Pharmacology] xanthophyll/cm [Drug Comparison] xanthophyll/pd [Pharmacology]","1757-1768","10","2010",-1

Horie","Prostate cancer working group report","The incidence of prostate cancer, while still lower than in Western nations, is increasing rapidly in Asian countries due to a more westernized lifestyle. Prostate cancer mortality is declining in the USA, where most prostate cancers are diagnosed in the early stage. In contrast, the mortality rates of prostate cancer in Asian countries are expected to continue to increase, because the percentage of advanced-stage prostate cancers remains high. Therefore, early detection by prostate-specific antigen screening and a comprehensive strategy for cancer prevention are essential for Asian people. The exposure rate of prostatespecific antigen screening is very low in Asian countries. Increased prostate-specific antigen screening may reduce the mortality rate. The stances regarding population screening differ among countries. Urological associations should promote population screening. Reliable data from Asian countries are needed. The prostate cancer incidence is low in Asian countries, perhaps due to high soy consumption. Isoflavones may prevent prostate cancer in Asian countries, but that is not yet clear. A large, multinational study in Asia is needed to clarify whether or not isoflavone consumption shows efficacy in preventing prostate cancer. Clinical data suggest that hormonal therapy is more effective in Asians than in Westerners. Clinical guidelines should consider including hormonal therapy as one of the options for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. At the same time, effort should be made to decrease the adverse effects of each treatment. Collaborative studies on the treatment of prostate cancer should be carried out among Asian countries.

The age patterns of the incidence of breast cancer in Asia differ from in the West: in most Asian countries the peak incidence of breast cancer is at about age 45-50, whereas in western countries the incidence continues to increase even at older ages. Mortality is decreasing in western countries, whereas it is still increasing in Asian nations. There are many epidemiological factors involved in breast cancer, and important known risk factors include diet, obesity and diabetes. Asian studies found that high intake of isoflavones reduced the risk of breast cancer. Pathology of breast cancer: With regard to the pathology of breast cancer, for the molecular subtype, luminal A and luminal B are being used, while HER2 expression and rapid proliferation are also employed. Study results showed a somewhat higher prevalence of luminal A in Japanese compared with Americans. Ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer is less frequent in Asian breast cancer patients than in Americans. The Working Group resolved to establish an international committee for pathological assessment of breast cancer in Asia. Treatment of Breast Cancer: Pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics studies are needed between ethnic backgrounds, investigating aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen (endoxifen), as well as the effects of demographic factors such as diet, medical care, body mass index, etc. Correlations between adverse events and the clinical outcome also need to be studied.

The dysregulation of the cell cycle can promote the development of cancer. A group of proteins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), that control the cell cycle, provide new targets for treating cancer. As a result, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) represent a novel class of chemotherapeutic agents. Of these, flavopiridol, a semisynthetic flavonoidal alkaloid, emerged as the first CDKI to enter clinical trials. Preclinical data indicate that flavopiridol could block the proliferation of neoplastic cells and induce programmed cell death as a single agent. Furthermore, recent emerging data revealed that flavopiridol can potentiate, generally in a dose- and sequence-dependent manner, the anti-tumor effects of many established chemotherapeutic agents.

Although ERalpha phosphorylation correlates with patient outcome, ERbeta is similarly phosphorylated but its significance in breast cancer has not been addressed. We investigated whether ERbeta that is phosphorylated at serine 105 (S105-ERbeta) is expressed in breast cancer and assessed potential clinical implications of this phosphorylation. Following antibody validation, S105-ERbeta expression was studied in tissue microarrays comprising 108 tamoxifen-resistant and 351 tamoxifen-sensitive cases and analyzed against clinical data. S105-ERbeta regulation in vitro was assessed by Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Nuclear S105-ERbeta was observed in breast carcinoma and was associated with better survival (Allred score >3), even in tamoxifen-resistant cases, and additionally correlated with ERbeta1 and ERbeta2 expression. Distinct S105-ERbeta nuclear speckles were seen in some higher grade tumors. S105-ERbeta levels increased in MCF-7 cells in response to 17beta-estradiol, the ERbeta-specific agonist diarylpropionitrile, and the partial ERbeta-agonist genistein. S105-ERbeta nuclear speckles were also seen in MCF-7 cells and markedly increased in size and number at 24 hours following 17beta-estradiol and, in particular diarylpropionitrile, treatment. These speckles were co-expressed with ERbeta1 and ERbeta2. Presence of S105-ERbeta in breast cancer and association with improved survival, even in endocrine resistant breast tumors suggest S105-ERbeta might be a useful additional prognostic marker in this disease.

Objective: We investigated whether soy protein with isoflavones and soy isoflavone extracts could improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women with early hyperglycemia. Design: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that included 180 postmenopausal Hong Kong Chinese women with prediabetes or early untreated diabetes.

Results: Three- or 6-mo treatments with soy protein with or without isoflavone supplementation did not result in favorable changes in the descriptors for glycemic control and insulin resistance, namely fasting and 2-h postload glucose, fasting and postload insulin, glycated serum protein, and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and beta-cell function. Conclusions: This 6-mo randomized controlled trial did not support the hypothesis that soy protein with or without isoflavone supplementation had favorable effects on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity among postmenopausal Chinese women.

Here, we examined the role of MCM2 in prostate cancer and the effect of microRNA-1296 (miR-1296), genistein, and trichostatin A (TSA) on the MCM complex. Profiling results showed that expression of MCM genes was higher in tumor samples. Genistein and TSA significantly downregulated the expression of all MCM genes. Genistein, TSA, and small interfering RNA duplexes caused a significant decrease in the S phase of the cell cycle. There was also downregulation of CDT1, CDC7, and CDK2 genes, which govern loading of the MCM complex on chromatin. We also found that miR-1296 was significantly downregulated in prostate cancer samples. In PC3 cells, inhibition of miR-1296 upregulated both MCM2 mRNA and protein, whereas overexpression caused a significant decrease in MCM2 mRNA, protein, and the S phase of the cell cycle. MCM genes are excellent anticancer drug targets because they are essential DNA replication factors that are highly expressed in cancer cells. This is the first report showing anti-MCM effect by miR-1296, genistein, and TSA. TSA is undergoing clinical trials as a prostate cancer treatment but has high toxicity. Genistein, a natural, nontoxic dietary isoflavone, may be an advantageous therapeutic agent for treating prostate cancer. The use of RNA interference is currently being implemented as a gene-specific approach for molecular medicine.

Objective: The objective was to prospectively evaluate whether the protective effect of soy is due to soy isoflavones alone or to their combination with other beneficial dietary factors in an Asian population. Design: Using principal components analysis, we previously identified a ""meat-dim sum"" pattern characterized by meat, starch, and dim sum items and a ""vegetable-fruit- soy"" pattern characterized by cruciferous vegetables, fruit, and tofu items in a population-based cohort of Singapore Chinese initiated between 1993 and 1998. Component scores representing intakes of each pattern were used in multivariable Cox regression models to analyze the relation between diet at baseline and breast cancer incidence. Results: As of 31 December 2005, 629 incident breast cancer cases had been diagnosed among the 34,028 women. With greater intake of the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern, we observed a dose-dependent trend (P < 0.01) for decreasing breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women [hazard ratio (HR): 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.95 for the fourth compared with first quartile]. A stronger association for the vegetable-fruit-soy pattern was observed among postmenopausal women with >5 y of follow-up (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.88; P for trend <0.01). No trend was observed for a greater intake of the meat-dim sum dietary pattern and increased breast cancer risk.

Forty-five eligible men were supplemented with 40, 60, and 80 mg of purifi ed isoflavones or no supplement from biopsy to prostatectomy. Compliance with the study agent, toxicity, and changes in plasma isoflavones, serum steroid hormones, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and tissue Ki-67 were analyzed from baseline to completion of the study. Forty-four subjects completed the study with a duration of intervention of 30 (+ 3) days. We observed significant increases in plasma isoflavones with treatment for all doses compared with controls without producing any toxicity. Significant increases in serum total estradiol were observed in the 40 and 60 mg isoflavone-treated arms. However, a significant increase in serum free testosterone was observed in the 60 mg isoflavone-treated arm. Changes in serum sex hormone-binding globulin, PSA, and percentage of tissue Ki-67 were not statistically significant with treatment for this sample size and duration of intervention. Our results identify a safe dose of purified isoflavones for future clinical trials and establish the need for further definitive, well-powered trials to examine the role of isoflavones in prostate carcinogenesis. 2010 BC Decker Inc.",NA,"adult aged article cancer localization clinical article clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study diet supplementation drug blood level drug efficacy drug hypersensitivity/si [Side Effect] drug safety estradiol blood level gastrointestinal toxicity/si [Side Effect] human human tissue male patient compliance phase 1 clinical trial prostate biopsy *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] *prostate cancer/su [Surgery] *prostatectomy randomized controlled trial steroid blood level testosterone blood level treatment duration aglycone/dt [Drug Therapy] antineoplastic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] antioxidant daidzein/cr [Drug Concentration] daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/cr [Drug Concentration] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] glycetin/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/cr [Drug Concentration] *isoflavone/do [Drug Dose] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] multivitamin prevastein hc prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] sex hormone binding globulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] steroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","3-13","8","2010",-1

Methods: Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis induction were analyzed by using flow cytometry when breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 were cotreated with daidzein (1, 5 mumol/L) and E2 (0.1-10 nmol/L) for 5 days. Whether daidzein could alter E 2-modulated mRNA expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) and ERbeta-estrogen response element (ERE) dependent transcription was investigated by RT-PCR and luciferase induction assays. The effects of daidzein on E2-modulated expression of proapoptotic p53, bax and antiapoptotic bcl-2 at both mRNA and protein levels were also investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot. Results: Daidzein enhanced the antiapoptotic effect in an E2 dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on E2-induced proliferation. Daidzein antagonized E 2-induced ERbeta mRNA expression and ERbeta-ERE dependent transcription. In addition, daidzein only antagonized E2-upregulated expression of p53 and bax, but had no effect on E2-upregulated expression of bcl-2. Conclusion: Daidzein enhances the antiapoptotic effect of E2 on breast cancer cells by inhibiting E2-mediated p53-bax proapoptotic pathway. These results suggest that dietary daidzein may enhance deleterious effect of endogenous E2 in hormone-dependent breast cancer. 2010 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",NA,"antineoplastic activity apoptosis article *breast cancer cell cycle progression cell proliferation cell strain MCF 7 concentration response controlled study diet therapy drug antagonism drug effect drug mechanism drug potentiation estrogen responsive element flow cytometry human human cell protein expression reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction transcription regulation upregulation Western blotting *daidzein/cb [Drug Combination] *daidzein/it [Drug Interaction] *daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] *estradiol/cb [Drug Combination] *estradiol/it [Drug Interaction] *estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] luciferase messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein Bax/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein p53/ec [Endogenous Compound]","10-16","22","2010",-1

Cancer patients with abnormal receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) tend to have more aggressive disease with poor clinical outcomes. As a result, human epidermal growth factor receptor kinases, such as EGFR (HER1), HER2, and HER3, represent important therapeutic targets. Several plant polyphenols including the type III polyketide synthase products (genistein, curcumin, resveratrol, and epigallocatechin-3-galate) possess chemopreventive activity, primarily as a result of RTK inhibition. However, only a small fraction of the polyphenolic structural universe has been evaluated. Along these lines, we have developed an in vitro route to the synthesis and subsequent screening of unnatural polyketide analogues with N-acetylcysteamine (SNAc) starter substrates and malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and methylmalonyl-CoA as extender substrates. The resulting polyketide analogues possessed a similar structural polyketide backbone (aromatic-2-pyrone) with variable side chains. Screening chalcone synthase (CHS) reaction products against BT-474 cells resulted in identification of several trifluoromethylcinnamoyl-based polyketides that showed strong suppression of the HER2-associated PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, yet did not inhibit the growth of nontransformed MCF-10A breast cells (IC 50>100 mum). Specifically, 4-trifluoromethylcinnamoyl pyrone (compound 2e) was highly potent (IC50< 200 nm) among the test compounds toward proliferation of several breast cancer cell lines. This breadth of activity likely stems from the ability of compound 2e to inhibit the phosphorylation of HER1, HER2, and HER3. Therefore, these polyketide analogues might prove to be useful drug candidates for potential breast cancer therapy. 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Saha","Redox regulation in cancer: A double-edged sword with therapeutic potential","Oxidative stress, implicated in the etiology of cancer, results from an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell's own antioxidant defenses. ROS deregulate the redox homeostasis and promote tumor formation by initiating an aberrant induction of signaling networks that cause tumorigenesis. Ultraviolet (UV) exposures, -radiation and other environmental carcinogens generate ROS in the cells, which can exert apoptosis in the tumors, thereby killing the malignant cells or induce the progression of the cancer growth by blocking cellular defense system. Cancer stem cells take the advantage of the aberrant redox system and spontaneously proliferate. Oxidative stress and gene-environment interactions play a significant role in the development of breast, prostate, pancreatic and colon cancer. Prolonged lifetime exposure to estrogen is associated with several kinds of DNA damage. Oxidative stress and estrogen receptor-associated proliferative changes are suggested to play important roles in estrogen-induced breast carcinogenesis. BRCA1, a tumor suppressor against hormone responsive cancers such as breast and prostate cancer, plays a significant role in inhibiting ROS and estrogen mediated DNA damage; thereby regulate the redox homeostasis of the cells. Several transcription factors and tumor suppressors are involved during stress response such as Nrf2, NFB and BRCA1. A promising strategy for targeting redox status of the cells is to use readily available natural substances from vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices. Many of the phytochemicals have already been identified to have chemopreventive potential, capable of intervening in carcinogenesis. 2010 Landes Bioscience.",NA,"antineoplastic activity apoptosis article breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] cancer cell cancer risk cancer stem cell carcinogenesis cardamom cell damage cell death cell proliferation chemoprophylaxis cinnamon clinical trial clove colon cancer drug sensitivity epidemiological data fruit gene expression health care cost herb human *neoplasm/dt [Drug Therapy] *neoplasm/pc [Prevention] nonhuman *oxidation reduction reaction oxidation reduction state *oxidative stress prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] protein function protein phosphorylation signal transduction skin papilloma/dt [Drug Therapy] spice vegetable 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone/pd [Pharmacology] 3 indolemethanol/dt [Drug Therapy] 3 indolemethanol/pd [Pharmacology] 3,3' diindolylmethane/pd [Pharmacology] BRCA1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] capsaicin/pd [Pharmacology] cardamom extract/dt [Drug Therapy] cardamom extract/ec [Endogenous Compound] cardamom extract/po [Oral Drug Administration] cinnamon extract/pd [Pharmacology] cisplatin/pd [Pharmacology] clove extract/ec [Endogenous Compound] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] cytotoxic agent/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] garlic extract/dt [Drug Therapy] garlic extract/po [Oral Drug Administration] garlic extract/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] n (2,3 dihydroxypropoxy) 3,4 difluoro 2 (2 fluoro 4 iodoanilino)benzamide/cb [Drug Combination] n (2,3 dihydroxypropoxy) 3,4 difluoro 2 (2 fluoro 4 iodoanilino)benzamide/pd [Pharmacology] plant extract/ec [Endogenous Compound] plant medicinal product/dt [Drug Therapy] plant medicinal product/pd [Pharmacology] rapamycin/cb [Drug Combination] rapamycin/pd [Pharmacology] reactive oxygen metabolite/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Nrf2/ec [Endogenous Compound] trastuzumab/pd [Pharmacology] tumor suppressor protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","23-34","3","2010",-1

A xenograft-model, pieces of normal human breast tissue implanted subcutaneously into 9-10-week-old athymic nude mice, was established. The mice were divided into five groups subjected to the following treatments: normal saline (Controls); alpha-ZAL at 1 and 5mg/kg; and estradiol benzoate (B-E 2) at 1 and 5mg/kg. Treatment was given every other day, and human breast tissues were removed for experiments after treatment for 30 days. The expression of c-myc, c-fos, and EGFR mRNAs were determined by in situ hybridization. alpha-ZAL decreased expression of c-myc (p<0.05). About 1mg/kg alpha-ZAL increased EGFR expression (p<0.05) and two dosage of alpha-ZAL increased c-fos expression (p<0.01) compared with control. B-E2 significantly increased expression of c-myc, c-fos, and EGFR mRNAs expression compared with controls (p<0.01). The extents of the increases in EGFRmRNA expression induced by alpha-ZAL and in c-fos mRNA by 5mg/kg alpha-ZAL were lower than those induced by B-E2 (p<0.01).

They can induce biologic responses in vertebrates by mimicking or modulating the action or production of endogenous hormones. This study examined mixtures of 12 food relevant PEs for effects on steroid hormone production, aromatase activity, estrogenic activity, and for interaction with the androgen receptor. The results show that a mixture of all tested PEs increased estradiol production and decreased testosterone production in H295R human adrenal corticocarcinoma cells, indicating an induced aromatase activity. Furthermore, exposure of the H295R cells to isoflavonoids caused a decrease in testosterone production, and various mixtures of PEs significantly stimulated MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell growth and induced aromatase activity in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. The estrogenic effect in the MCF7 cells of the isoflavonoid mixture and coumestrol was supported by an observed increase in progesterone receptor protein expression as well as a decreased ER expression. Overall, the results support that nutrition-relevant concentrations of PEs both alone and in mixtures possess various endocrine disrupting effects, all of which need to be considered when assessing the effects on human health.

Interestingly, till the early nineties very little was known about them but eventually, the microRNAs have become forefront in the area of research. The huge number of microRNAs plus each one of them targeting a vast number of related as well as unrelated genes makes them very interesting molecules to study. To add to the mystery of miRNAs is the fact that the same miRNA can have antagonizing role in two different cell types i.e. in one cell type; the miRNA promotes proliferation whereas in another cell type the same miRNA inhibits proliferation. Another remarkable aspect of the microRNAs is that many of them exist in clusters. In humans alone, out of 721 microRNAs known, 247 of them occur in 64 clusters at an inter-miRNA distance of less than 5000bp. The reason for this clustering of miRNAs is not fully understood but since the miRNA clusters are evolutionary conserved, their significance cannot be ruled out. The objective of this review is to summarize the recent progress on the functional characterization of miR-23a~27a~24-2 cluster in humans in relation to various health and diseased conditions and to highlight the cooperative effects of the miRNAs of this cluster. 2010 Chhabra et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"acute granulocytic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia antineoplastic activity article bile duct carcinoma bladder cancer breast cancer cancer resistance carcinogenesis cell differentiation cell proliferation chronic lymphatic leukemia gene control gene duplication gene expression gene targeting heart ventricle hypertrophy hematopoiesis human lipid metabolism liver cell carcinoma muscle atrophy osteoarthritis stomach cancer activin/ec [Endogenous Compound] antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] atrogin 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] BRCA1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] collagenase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin B/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin dependent kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glutaminase/ec [Endogenous Compound] methyl 2 cyano 3,11 dioxo 18beta olean 1,12 dien 30 oate/pd [Pharmacology] *microRNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] multidrug resistance protein 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] muscle RING finger 1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] Myc protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma/ec [Endogenous Compound] promyelocytic leukemia protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] retinoic acid receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] Smad3 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] Smad4 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] Smad5 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] somatomedin binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] survivin/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor FKHR/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor NFAT/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor RUNX1/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug unindexed drug vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] vasculotropin receptor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] vasculotropin receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"9","2010",-1

For this purpose, we subcutaneously administered Griff C (2, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d BW), 17beta-estradiol (E2: 10 mug/kg/d BW) as positive control, and a vehicle control respectively for three days.

Results showed that Griff C up-regulated the expression of PR, ACE, ERalpha, VEGF, VEGFR2 and Ki67. However, the results of Cox-2, PCNA, and eNOS expression did not reach significance in the E2 and Griff C treated samples.

Huang","Epigenetic influences of low-dose bisphenol A in primary human breast epithelial cells","Substantial evidence indicates that exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) during early development may increase breast cancer risk later in life. The changes may persist into puberty and adulthood, suggesting an epigenetic process being imposed in differentiated breast epithelial cells. The molecular mechanisms by which early memory of BPA exposure is imprinted in breast progenitor cells and then passed onto their epithelial progeny are not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine epigenetic changes in breast epithelial cells treated with low-dose BPA. We also investigated the effect of BPA on the ERalpha signaling pathway and global gene expression profiles. Compared to control cells, nuclear internalization of ERalpha was observed in epithelial cells preexposed to BPA. We identified 170 genes with similar expression changes in response to BPA. Functional analysis confirms that gene suppression was mediated in part through an ERalpha-dependent pathway. As a result of exposure to BPA or other estrogen-like chemicals, the expression of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3) became epigenetically silenced in breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, increased DNA methylation in the LAMP3 CpG island was this repressive mark preferentially occurred in ERalpha-positive breast tumors. These results suggest that the in vitro system developed in our laboratory is a valuable tool for exposure studies of BPA and other xenoestrogens in human cells. Individual and geographical differences may contribute to altered patterns of gene expression and DNA methylation in susceptible loci.

The estrogenic property of 4,4'-(octahydro-4,7-methano-5H-inden-5-ylidene)bisphenol in the uterotrophic assay was slightly stronger than that of genistein or nonylphenol, but weaker than that of ethinyl estradiol. We performed a 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study (enhanced OECD test guideline No. 407) on 4,4'- (octahydro-4,7-methano-5H-inden-5-ylidene)bisphenol based on the OECD draft protocol. The test chemical, administered orally at doses of 0, 10, 50, and 250 mg/kg per day for at least 28 days, caused such estrogenic effects as abnormal estrous cycle, increased ovarian follicles, increased uterine epithelial height, and vaginal mucification in the 50 and/or 250 mg/kg groups. Moreover, follicular epithelial cell hyperplasia of the thyroid was detected in all male rats given the test chemical and in female rats in the 250 mg/kg group. It was concluded that the estrogenic effects were detected in growing rats given 4,4'-(octahydro-4,7-methano-5H-inden-5-ylidene)bisphenol, and thyroid dysfunction was also observed as the endocrine-mediated effects.

Pazos-Moura","Effects of dietary fish oil on thyroid hormone signaling in the liver","N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) present in fish oil (FO) potently decrease serum lipids, which is also an effect of thyroid hormones. Both PUFAs and thyroid hormones affect hepatic lipid metabolism, and here we hypothesized that a long-term diet rich in n-3 PUFAs would enhance thyroid hormone action in the liver. Female rats received isocaloric and normolipid diets containing either soybean oil (SO) or FO during lactation. Male offspring received the same diet as their dams since weaning until sacrifice when they were 11 weeks old. FO group, as compared to SO group, exhibited lower body weight since 5 weeks of age until sacrifice, with no alterations in food ingestion, lower retroperitoneal white fat mass and elevated inguinal fat mass relative to body weight, with unchanged water and lipid but reduced protein percentage in their carcasses. FO diet resulted in lower serum triglycerides and cholesterol. Serum total triiodothyronine, total thyroxine and thyrotropin were similar between groups. However, liver thyroid hormone receptor (TR)beta1 protein expression was higher in the FO group and correlated negatively with serum lipids. Liver 5'-deiodinase activity, which converts thyroxine into triiodothyronine, was similar between groups. However, the activity of hepatic mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in thermogenesis and a well-characterized target stimulated by T3 via TRbeta1, was higher in the FO group, suggesting enhancement of thyroid hormone action. These findings suggest that the increase in thyroid hormone signaling pathways in the liver may be one of the mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs exert part of their effects on lipid metabolism. 2010 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"animal tissue article body weight cholesterol blood level controlled study *dietary intake female lipid blood level *lipid metabolism liver male nonhuman protein content protein expression rat signal transduction triacylglycerol blood level water content white adipose tissue cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *fish oil glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] liothyronine/ec [Endogenous Compound] omega 3 fatty acid soybean oil *thyroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyroid hormone receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyrotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] thyroxine/ec [Endogenous Compound] triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","935-940","21","2010",-1

Ligands elicit in ERalpha conformational changes leading to the recruitment of coactivators required for the transactivation of target genes via cognate response elements. In many cells, activated ERalpha also undergoes downregulation by proteolysis mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Although these various molecular processes have been well characterized, little is known as to which extent they are interrelated. In the present study, we used a panel of type I (estradiol derivatives and ""linear"", non-steroidal ligands) and type II (""angular"" ligands) estrogens, in order to identify possible relationships between ligand binding affinity, recruitment of LxxLL-containing coactivators, ERalpha downregulation in MCF-7 cells and related transactivation activity of ligand-bound ERalpha. For type I estrogens, there was a clear-cut relationship between ligand binding affinity, hydrophobicity around C-11 of estradiol and ability of ERalpha to associate with LxxLL motifs, both in cell-free condition and in vivo (MCF-7 cells). Moreover, LxxLL motif recruitment by ERalpha seemed to be a prerequisite for the downregulation of the receptor. By contrast, type II ligands, as well as estradiol derivatives bearing a bulky side chain at 11beta, had much less tendency to promote ERalpha-LxxLL interaction or even behaved as antagonists in this respect, in agreement with the well known partial estrogenicity/antiestrogenicity of some of these compounds. Interestingly, some type II ligands which antagonized LxxLL motif recruitment were nonetheless able to enhance ERalpha-mediated gene transactivation. 2009 Elsevier Inc.

However, clinical trials in humans were few and the effects remained uncertain.Objectives: To examine whether soy protein with isoflavones and isoflavone extracts exert beneficial effects on body composition among postmenopausal women.Design: A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted among 180 postmenopausal Chinese women with mild hyperglycemia. After a 2-week adaptation, participants were randomly assigned to one of the three arms to receive 15 g soy protein and 100 mg isoflavones (Soy group), or 15 g milk protein and 100 mg isoflavones (Iso group), or 15 g milk protein (placebo group) on a daily basis for 6 months.Results: We observed a mild but significant favorable effect of soy protein with isoflavones on the changes of body weight (BW), body mass index, and body fat percentage relative to isoflavone extracts and milk protein after 6-month supplementation. The mean differences of BW between the Soy and the Iso groups were 0.75 kg (95% CI:-1.363 to-0.136, P=0.017), and between the Soy and the placebo groups were-0.60 kg (95% CI:-1.209 to-0.019, P=0.047). The mean difference of change percentage in body fat percentage between the Soy and the Iso groups was 3.74% (95% CI:-6.88 to-0.60%, P=0.02), and between the Soy and the placebo groups was 2.54% (95% CI:-5.69 to-0.12%.

We evaluated the effect of a low fat diet on serum factors affecting prostate cancer cell growth by performing a prospective, randomized dietary intervention trial in men with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: We randomized 18 men with prostate cancer who did not receive prior therapy to a low fat (15% kcal), high fiber, soy protein supplemented diet or a Western (40% kcal fat) diet for 4 weeks. Fasting serum was collected at baseline and after the intervention to measure prostate specific antigen, sex hormones, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I and II, insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, lipids and fatty acids. LNCaP cells (ATCC) were cultured in medium containing pre-intervention and post-intervention human serum to assess the in vitro effect of the diet on prostate cancer cell proliferation. Results: Subjects in each group were highly compliant with the dietary intervention. Serum from men in the low fat group significantly decreased the growth of LNCaP cells relative to Western diet serum (p = 0.03). There were no significant between group changes in serum prostate specific antigen, sex hormones, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I and II, and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins. Serum triglyceride and linoleic acid (-6) levels were decreased in the low fat group (p = 0.034 and 0.005, respectively). Correlation analysis revealed that decreased -6 and increased -3 fatty acid correlated with decreased serum stimulated LNCaP cell growth (r = 0.64, p = 0.004 and r = -0.49, p = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions: In this prospective, randomized dietary intervention trial a low fat diet resulted in changes in serum fatty acid levels that were associated with decreased human LNCaP cancer cell growth. Further prospective trials are indicated to evaluate the potential of low fat diets for prostate cancer prevention and treatment. 2010 American Urological Association.",NA,"adult article *cancer cell cancer growth cell proliferation cell strain LNCaP clinical article clinical evaluation clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study diet restriction diet supplementation fatty acid blood level high fiber diet hormone blood level human human cell in vitro study lipid blood level *low fat diet male priority journal prospective study *prostate cancer/di [Diagnosis] *prostate cancer/th [Therapy] protein blood level randomized controlled trial triacylglycerol blood level fatty acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] insulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] linoleic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] lipid/ec [Endogenous Compound] omega 3 fatty acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] sex hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] somatomedin B/ec [Endogenous Compound] somatomedin binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] somatomedin C soybean protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","345-350","183","2010",-1

(Umbelliferae). It was found that SSd stimulated the proliferation of MCF-7 cells by using MCF-7 cell proliferation assay. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the proliferation-stimulating effect was associated with a marked increase in the number of MCF-7 cells in S phase. These actions of SSd were dose-dependent at doses ranging from 10 nM to 10 muM and could be significantly inhibited by the specific estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI-182780. Co-incubation of MCF-7 cells with 1 muM of ER antagonist ICI-182780 abolished the inductive effects of SSd on estrogen response element (ERE)-luciferase activity, suggesting that the estrogenic effects of SSd were mediated through the estrogen receptors. To evaluate the relative involvement of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) in mediating the actions of SSd, ER-negative human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were cotransfected with the ERE-luciferase reporter construct and either ERalpha or ERbeta construct. The results showed that SSd could activate ERE-luciferase activity via the ERalpha-mediated pathway in a dose-dependent manner (10 nM to 10 muM); whereas, the activation of ERbeta-mediated ERE-luciferase activity by SSd only occurred at a high concentration (10 muM). Furthermore, the ERalpha protein and mRNA levels were increased by treatment with SSd within 24 h. These data support our hypothesis that SSd acts as a weak phytoestrogen. Presumably, the estrogenic effect of SSd is mediated by the estrogen receptor. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

(1) NF-B is activated in response to tobacco, stress, dietary agents, obesity, alcohol, infectious agents, irradiation, and environmental stimuli that account for as much as 95% of all cancers. (2) The transcription factor has been linked with transformation of cells. (3) It is constitutively active in most tumor cells. (4) It has also been linked with the survival of cancer stem cells, an early progenitor cell that has acquired self-renewal potential. (5) NF-B regulates the expression of most anti-apoptotic gene products associated with the survival of the tumor. (6) It also regulates the gene products linked with proliferation of tumors. (7) The transcription factor controls the expression of gene products linked with invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer. (8) While most carcinogens activate NF-B, most chemopreventive agents suppress its activation. These observations suggest that NF-B is intimately intertwined with cancer growth and metastasis. The mechanism that leads to constitutive activation of NF-B in hematological, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, gynecological, thoracic head and neck, breast, and skin cancers, and the ways NF-B is activated are the topics of discussion in this review. 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"breast cancer cancer growth cancer invasion cancer stem cell carcinogenesis cell renewal cell survival cell transformation clinical trial conference paper diet digestive system cancer environmental factor gynecologic cancer head and neck cancer hematologic malignancy human infection irradiation metastasis *neoplasm nonhuman obesity skin cancer stress thorax cancer tobacco tumor cell tumor vascularization urogenital tract cancer 1' acetoxychavicol acetate/pd [Pharmacology] 3 indolemethanol/pd [Pharmacology] acetyl 11 oxo beta boswellic acid/pd [Pharmacology] alcohol anacardic acid/pd [Pharmacology] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] betulic acid/pd [Pharmacology] boswellin/pd [Pharmacology] capsaicin/pd [Pharmacology] carcinogen celastrol/pd [Pharmacology] coronarin d/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] deguelin/pd [Pharmacology] embelin/pd [Pharmacology] epicatechin/pd [Pharmacology] gene product genistein/pd [Pharmacology] gossypine/pd [Pharmacology] guggulsterone/pd [Pharmacology] *immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] natural product/pd [Pharmacology] plumbagin/pd [Pharmacology] resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] simvastatin/pd [Pharmacology] transcription factor unclassified drug withanolide/pd [Pharmacology] xanthohumol/pd [Pharmacology]","25-37","336","2010",-1

In the end, samples of 11 different tissues were collected for relative mRNA level analyses using Real-Time RT-PCR. Compared with the Se-supplemented pigs, the Se-deficient pigs showed lower (P < 0.05) mRNA level of gpx1, gpx3, selpp1, selS in blood and several tissues. In contrast, dietary Se deficiency enhanced (P < 0.05) mRNA levels of sps2, selI, selO, selT and selV in various tissues. Pigs fed 0.3 mg Se/kg had greater (P < 0.05) mRNA levels of sel15, sps2, selH, selI, selM and selV in thyroid, spleen, or pituitary than those of the other two groups.

"1183","1092"," J. Kohrle","Endocrine disruptors or goitrogens? Effects of UV screens, synthetic and nutritive compounds on thyroid function","Thyroid hormone (TH) biosynthesis, storage and secretion is organized in a complex series of biochemical reactions round an evolutionary conserved functional unit, the thyroid follicle, a highly vascularised epithelial structure enclosing the colloidal lumen mainly composed of thyroglobulin (Tg). The luminal apical surface of this tight epithelial monolayer is the site of H2O2 dependent TH biosynthesis and is involved in mobilization of Tg, the colloidal matrix and storage protein. The initial step of biosynthesis, basolateral iodide uptake by the sodium-iodide symporter NIS, is blocked by voluminous anions (e.g. ClO4-), a rocket fuel increasingly contaminating the global surface. Nutritive components have been identified as goitrogens, such as C-and O-glycosidic glucosinolates (cruciferacea), cyanates, isocyanates and thiocyanates (e.g. cassava), which (irreversibly) inhibit thyroperoxidase (TPO). Several flavonoids and isoflavonoids, widely used as 'green' 'natural plant steroids' in postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy such as genistein and UV screens (e.g. benzophenone 2) regularly applied as sun protectants to prevent erythema, sun burns and skin cancer are potent TPO inhibitors and lead to goiter formation if iodine supply is inadequate as in many parts of the world. No specific inhibitors of thyrooxidase (Duox) or cathepsins involved in T4 and T3 liberation from Tg or of plasma membrane transporters (MCT8, OATP14, LATs) involved in thyroid secretion or cellular uptake of T4 and T3 have been identified among endocrine disrupters. Several endocrine disrupters have been reported to displace T4 and T3 from its binding to the serum distributor protein transthyretin (TTR), resulting in altered free TH levels, increased cellular uptake or renal excretion. Among these agents are flavonoids (F21388), flame retardants (TBBPA) and other phenolic or aromatic compounds with structural similarities to T4. However, several endocrine disrupters are also potent inhibitors of intracellular deiodinase enzymes, (de-)conjugating enzymes (sulfotransferase, glucuronidase, sulfatase) and T3 receptors, thus interfering with intracellular availability and action of the ligand T3, which modulates gene expression by T3 receptors TRalpha and TRbeta. Therefore, several of the identified endocrine disruptors exhibit multiple modes of interference in the TH axis and raise major concern especially under conditions of inadequate iodine supply and during life phases sensitive to altered TH availability such as fetal, neonatal, pubertal development, pregnancy, aging and euthyroid sick syndrome.

In many patients, quality of life deteriorates, particularly due to hot flashes and sweating. Generally these symptoms can be treated with various methods such as Chinese herbal medicine, SSRIs, isoflavone, yoga, etc., but the results is insufficient. In 2008, Lipov etal. reported that stellate ganglion block is an effective treatment for hot flashes and night awakenings in breast cancer patients. We report a case of a treatment using a stellate ganglion block induced low level laser therapy (LLLT) which is a non-invasive and safe method. Material and Methods: We treated 20 patients with LLLT. All patients had received endocrine therapy, such as LH-RH agonist + TAM or TAM or AIs, and the average age was 44.1. A previous treatment for menopauselike symptoms such as hot flashes, sweating and insomnia was included in an untreated patient, but as is common, Chinese herbal medicine and SSRIs were given. Written informed consent was obtained prior to the start of therapy. We used two machines: one was a low-level diode laser device and the other was a near-infrared laser device. The laser photoradiation site was the sixth and seventh cervical transverse process vertebrae. Treatment time was approximately 10 minutes. We evaluated the therapeutic effects and according to symptom frequency using a hot flash score. Results: No adverse effects of treatment were recognized, and the hot flash score mean decreased from 63.2 points before treatment to 28.0 points after treatment. In addition, we were able to confirm a decrease in the frequency of hot flashes and sweating in 85% of all patients.

McCann","Usual intakes of total and specific isoflavones in association with breast tumor characteristics","Introduction: Although soy isoflavones intakes have been associated with reduced breast cancer risk in many populations, there is still uncertainty as to the relationships between these compounds and breast cancer clinical characteristics, which may have implications for prognosis and survival. Methods: Included in this study were women with newly diagnosed, incident breast cancer (n = 683) and women without a history of breast cancer (n = 611) enrolled in Roswell Park Cancer Institute's Data Bank and BioRepository. Epidemiologic and dietary data were collected by self-administered questionnaires, and clinical data from breast cancer cases were abstracted from medical records. Total and specific isoflavones intakes were calculated from the food frequency questionnaire using published food composition data. Polytomous logistic regression was performed to determine the relationship between tertiles of intakes of total and specific isoflavones and tumor characteristics, adjusting for known risk factors and stratifying by menopausal status. Results: In the sample overall, compared to controls, cases in the highest vs. lowest tertile of total isoflavone intake had approximately 30% decreased odds of having an invasive tumor and an approximately 60% decreased odds of having a grade 1 tumor. Among specific isoflavones, intakes in the highest vs. lowest tertile were associated as follows: for genistein, an approximately 60% decreased odds of having grade 1 tumor; and for glycetein, an approximately 25% decreased odds of being a case, 60% decreased odds of having grade1 tumor, and 30% decreased odds of having HER2 negative tumor. In postmenopausal women only, cases in the highest vs. lowest tertile of glycetein intake had an approximately 30% decreased odds of having luminal A or stage I disease. In premenopausal women only, higher total isoflavone, daidzein, genistein, and glycetein intakes were associated with an approximately 70% decreased odds of having a large (>2cm) tumor. Further, those premenopausal women in the highest vs. lowest tertile of total isoflavone and genistein intakes had an approximately 60% decreased odds of having stage II breast cancer. Higher intakes of total and specific isoflavones were not associated with tumor characteristics indicative of a poor prognosis. Conclusions: In general, higher total isoflavone intake (and some specific isoflavones intakes) were associated with a reduced risk of tumors with more favorable prognostic characteristics. Intakes of total and specific isoflavones had no association with tumors having less favorable characteristics. In premenopausal women, however, higher intakes of isoflavones appear to be associated with a decreased risk of having large (>2cm) tumors. In this study, there is little evidence that isoflavones are associated with indicators associated with poor prognosis or recurrence, suggesting that these compounds may operate through mechanisms specific to the biologic heterogeneity of the tumor. Further research is warranted to address the impact of tumor heterogeneity in studies of isoflavones and breast cancer.",NA,"*cancer prevention *breast tumor tumor breast cancer human female prognosis risk data base questionnaire medical record food frequency questionnaire food composition logistic regression analysis risk factor postmenopause cancer risk population survival cancer center clinical study *isoflavone derivative isoflavone genistein glycitein phenobarbital daidzein",NA,"3","2010",1
"1191","1097"," J. W. Lampe","Vegetable constituents and biotransformation enzymes: The effect of genetic variation on response","Essential nutrients, other dietary constituents, and various foods have been shown to be associated with cancer risk in epidemiologic studies and in animal models of carcinogenesis. Modulation of phase I and phase II biotransformation enzymes is one mechanism by which diet is hypothesized to influence cancer risk. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of exogenous compounds, including drugs, carcinogens, and dietary constituents, and endogenous compounds, such as steroid hormones. Many phytochemicals in plant foods are metabolized by biotransformation enzymes, and they also influence expression and activities of these enzymes. Particular botanical families of plant foods are often unique, rich sources of specific classes of phytochemicals. For example the allium or onion family contains high amounts of allyl sulfides; apiaceous or carrot-family vegetables are sources of furanocoumarins; certain legumes are major sources of isoflavones; and cruciferous or broccoli-family vegetables are the primary dietary sources of precursors of isothiocyanates and indoles. This presentation will focus on epidemiologic and intervention studies that have investigated associations between plant food, particularly cruciferous vegetable, intakes and cancer risk or biotransformation enzyme activity and will examine the impact of genetic variation on these responses. Many of the genes that encode for biotransformation enzymes are highly polymorphic and variants in both phase I and phase II enzymes have been shown to modify response to dietary exposures. Phase I metabolic activation of carcinogens is typically catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of oxidation enzymes and other classes of enzymes, such as peroxidases (e.g., cyclooxygenases), and transferases (e.g., N-acetyltransferase). CYP1A2 activates several procarcinogens, including heterocyclic amines, and is also the main enzyme involved in caffeine metabolism. In a study of BRCA1 mutation carriers, a polymorphism in CYP1A2 had no overall effect on breast cancer risk; however, among women with at least one variant C allele (AC or CC), those who consumed caffeinated coffee had a 64% reduction in breast cancer risk, compared with women who never consumed coffee (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18-0.73) (1). In controlled feeding studies, cruciferous vegetable consumption increases CYP1A2 activity in humans in a dose-dependent manner, whereas apiaceous vegetables decreases activity of this enzyme (2,3), due to the inhibitory effects of the furanocoumarins (4). When participants were stratified by CYP1A2 genotype, induction of CYP1A2 activity by cruciferous vegetables was most pronounced in the CC genotype (3). Interestingly, when cruciferous vegetables are fed concurrently with apiaceous vegetables, the effect is similar to when eating a fruit- and vegetable-free diet. Polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes result in complete lack of GSTM1-1 and GSTT1-1 proteins, respectively. Studies show effect modification of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes on the association between cruciferous vegetable intake (or isothiocyanate exposure) and the risk of several cancers, including lung, gastric, prostate, bladder, and colon. Investigators have hypothesized that GSTM1-null or GSTT1-null individuals have reduced metabolism of isothiocyanates and therefore greater and longer exposure to these compounds. Interestingly, two studies show that GSTM1-null individuals tend to have more rapid and higher percentages of sulforaphane excretion than individuals who have at least one intact allele (i.e., GSTM1-positive) (5,6) and another shows no differences in isothiocyanate excretion (7). Despite this apparent lack of a metabolic difference, several short-term interventions with cruciferous vegetables suggest that GSTM1-null individuals have a greater intermediate biomarker response to isothiocyanates. For example, two levels of cruciferous vegetables supplementation significantly increased serum GST-alpha, primarily in GSTM1-null/GSTT1-null men (8). Broccoli supplementation also conferred increased protectio against hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA strand breaks and lower levels of oxidized DNA bases in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from smokers (9). We have observed similar genotype differences in relation to changes in biomarkers of inflammation with cruciferous vegetable feeding. In conclusion, results of observational and intervention studies point to the complex interactions among types of foods consumed, genetic variation, and modulation of xenobiotic metabolism. Effects of genotype must be considered within the context of diet and other exposures in order to understand the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk and opportunity for prevention. .",NA,"*vegetable *cancer prevention *genetic variability *biotransformation cancer risk human genotype exposure metabolism diet plant excretion intervention study modulation broccoli breast cancer female allele coffee gene feeding food supplementation garlic onion carrot legume precursor enzyme activity metabolic activation oxidation mutation eating fruit risk neoplasm lung prostate bladder serum male protection DNA strand breakage peripheral blood mononuclear cell smoking inflammation xenobiotic metabolism prevention nutrient animal model carcinogenesis epidemiology *enzyme isothiocyanic acid derivative plant medicinal product isothiocyanic acid DNA carcinogen allyl sulfide isoflavone derivative indole derivative cytochrome P450 peroxidase transferase acyltransferase heterocyclic amine caffeine protein sulforaphane biological marker cytochrome hydrogen peroxide DNA base endogenous compound steroid hormone",NA,"3","2010",-1
"1193","1098"," G. Maskarinec","Soy foods and cancer risk: How does the relation vary in individuals with different ethnicity, diet, and lifestyle?","Soy foods have been part of traditional Asian diets for many centuries, while soy products were introduced in Western countries only a few decades ago. Migrants from Asia maintained their food habits to a certain degree when they moved to the U.S., but they also adopted Western foods (1). Inspired by studies among migrants and by the low incidence rates for several cancers among Asians, research into the protective effects of isoflavones in soy foods was initiated. Due to their estrogen-like structure, much of the research has focused on hormone-dependent cancers, i.e., breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancer, but some work on colorectal cancer has also been performed. During years of experimental and epidemiologic research, it has become evident that not all populations may derive the same benefit from consuming soy foods. One of the more consistent findings in soy research is the fact that epidemiologic studies report a stronger protective effect of soy foods against breast cancer among women who grew up in Asian countries and in those who consumed soy foods throughout childhood and adolescence (2). This presentation will focus on epidemiologic studies that have investigated the association between soy foods and cancer risk among populations with different ethnic backgrounds. In addition, some underlying mechanisms that may be responsible for ethnic differences, such as intestinal equol production, genetic polymorphisms, and timing of exposure will be discussed. Epidemiologic studies among women of Asian, primarily Japanese and Chinese, ancestry show a more consistent protective effect against breast cancer than investigations among Western populations; the odds ratio (OR) was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60-0.85) among Asians when the highest and lowest intake group were compared, while soy food was unrelated to breast cancer risk in Western studies (OR = 1.04; 95%CI: 0.97-1.11) (2). Similarly, a meta-analysis of prostate cancer studies found a lower risk associated with soy consumption only among Asian (OR = 0.52; 95%CI: 0.33-0.81) but not Western populations (OR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.85-1.16) (3). On the other hand, meta-analyses for endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer described only small differences in associations by ethnicity (4, 5). Recent case-control analyses nested within the Multiethnic Cohort in Hawaii and Los Angeles examined urinary isoflavone excretion as a biomarker of soy intake and reported similar results for breast but not prostate cancer. While the risk associated with breast cancer was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.51-0.92) among Japanese Americans and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.61-1.55) among Caucasians (6), the risk estimates did not differ by ethnicity for prostate cancer (7). Evidence from observational and intervention studies also suggests possible differential effects of soy intake on biomarkers of breast cancer risk (8-10), e.g., mammographic density and concentrations of serum estrogens and testosterone, urinary estrogen metabolite patterns, IGF-I, and PSA. Whereas the higher intake and possibly the type of soy foods in Asian populations may explain the observations for breast and prostate cancer risk (11), bioavailability of bioactive substances may also be a contributing factor (12). For example, the capacity of the intestinal bacteria to metabolize the isoflavone dadzein into the metabolite equol varies across populations and may confer a greater protection against disease than the other isoflavonoids (13, 14). Another reason that not all individuals may benefit from soy food exposure to the same degree is genetic variation. Genetic polymorphisms may alter enzyme activity or modulate the expression of genes involved in pathways influenced by isoflavones and relevant to cancer risk. Menopausal status, obesity, and other dietary components are other causes for isoflavones to exert differential actions across populations. Alternatively, the overall effect of soy foods on carcinogenesis may depend on the time of life when isoflavones were administered because isoflavones have estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects. A number of case-control studies that assessed soy intake during childhood or adolescence found a stronger protection for early life than adult soy intake. Since experimental studies indicate that estrogen exposure in young animals induces protection against cancer development, the weak estrogenic effects of isoflavones in soy beans, if consumed early in life, may achieve or accelerate differentiation of breast tissue structures similar to an early pregnancy and, thereby, make the tissue less susceptible to carcinogens and prevent tumor development later in life. Since the reports about beneficial effects of soy against cancer come primarily from Asian populations who have consumed soy foods since childhood and whose diet and lifestyle differs in many other ways from Western countries, the expectations of individuals in Western countries who start eating soy products later in life may not be fulfilled. Therefore, future research in different populations should focus on how soy affects cancer risk throughout life.",NA,"*soybean *cancer risk *lifestyle *diet *ethnicity *cancer prevention population Asian breast cancer prostate cancer breast risk neoplasm epidemiology exposure protection United States childhood human female adolescence genetic polymorphism meta analysis metabolite colorectal cancer Japanese feeding behavior first trimester pregnancy tissue tumor eating excretion Asian American intervention study density estrogen blood level estrogen urine level bioavailability intestine flora Asia genetic variability enzyme activity gene obesity carcinogenesis incidence food case control study ethnic difference adult experimental study juvenile animal tissue structure isoflavone derivative estrogen equol isoflavone carcinogen biological marker testosterone hormone",NA,"3","2010",-1

Grossmann","Combination of intermittent calorie restriction and eicosapentaenoic acid for inhibition of mammary tumors","Introduction: Nutrition can have a profound effect on breast cancer inhibition and growth. We have focused on two dietary interventions that separately prevent mammary tumorigenesis, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an -3 fatty acid, and intermittent calorie restriction (ICR), as we recently reported that multiple periods of intermittent caloric restriction (ICR) were superior for inhibition of mammary tumor (MT) formation compared to chronic calorie restriction. Here we assessed whether combining two interventions, EPA consumption and ICR, would achieve even greater inhibition of breast cancer formation than either alone. Methods: Four groups of MMTV-HER-2/neu transgenic mice that are genetically programmed to develop mammary tumors were utilized. From 10 weeks of age half of the mice were fed a diet with fat derived from soy oil and the other half consumed a diet with 71.75% of fat calories from EPA. Mice were further divided into ad libitum (AL) or intermittent caloric restricted (ICR) groups. AL groups (soy oil and EPA) received unrestricted access to their diets. ICR groups were fed calories equal to 100% of the AL age-matched groups for three weeks followed by three weeks of calories equal to 50% of the AL age-matched groups. Mice were weighed weekly and carefully examined for mammary tumors. The 6 week cycle of restriction/refeeding was maintained until the mice were 55 weeks or were euthanized due to MTs. Results: The Ad Lib Soy and Ad Lib EPA groups ate similar amounts and gained weight at similar rates. The body weights of the ICR Soy and ICR EPA groups were not significantly different from each other but were significantly lower than the Ad Lib mice. The tumor free period was shortest in the AL Soy with increasingly long tumor free periods for the Ad Lib EPA, ICR Soy and the ICR EPA groups. The tumor free period of the ICR EPA group was significantly longer than all the other groups (ICR EPA vs Ad Lib Soy P<0.002, vs Ad Lib EPA P<0.004, vs ICR Soy P<0.007). ICR EPA survival until terminal end point was also significantly different than for all other groups (ICR EPA (100%) vs Ad Lib Soy (47%) P<0.0006, vs Ad Lib EPA (60%) P<0.004, vs ICR Soy (74%) P<0.03). The average week to palpable tumor (7 mm) was 43 weeks for the Soy fed group and 49.3 weeks for the EPA fed group. The percentage of mice that were tumor free at the end of the study and the tumor burden per animal were significantly different. Cohorts of Ad Lib Soy and Ad Lib EPA mice were anesthetized and serum obtained 17 weeks (25 weeks of age) or 29 weeks (37 weeks of age) after enrollment. All mice were tumor free at the time of collection and there were three mice from each group (12 mice total). An array based scheme was performed in triplicate to examine the serum levels of 308 different proteins. A number of proteins were differentially regulated by consumption of EPA compared to Soy oil. Of particular interest to us was the fact that several proteins that are part of the NFB pathway were down-regulated at both the ages of 25 and 37 weeks by EPA. Conclusions: These results illustrate that mammary tumor inhibition is significantly increased when ICR and EPA are combined as compared to either intervention alone or no intervention. It also identifies the NFB pathway as a potential pathway of interest for inhibition of mammary tumor formation. Understanding how this pathway is affected may aid in the development of drugs that could be used for breast cancer prevention.",NA,"*breast tumor *caloric restriction *cancer prevention mouse calorie tumor diet breast cancer carcinogenesis cancer inhibition weight body weight tumor volume survival blood level serum transgenic mouse nutrition *icosapentaenoic acid soybean oil protein fatty acid",NA,"3","2010",-1

Until now fourteen isoforms have been identified, which have been subdivided into three different classes (I, II and III) based on the amino acid sequences. In the present work, we have cloned GLUT12 (class III) from the mammary cancer cell line MCF7 and studied its kinetic characteristics and sensitivity for classical GLUT transporters inhibitors, still unknown. GLUT12 was expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and kinetic parameters were obtained using uptake assays. Selectivity for inhibitors was studied on transfected MDCK cells. The studies were performed in sodium buffer at pH 7,5. 3-O-methyl-D-glucose showed a K0.5 of 5mM and Vmax of 24 pmoles/oocyte/min. In the absence of Na+ the sugar uptake was decreased by 50%, which suggested the possibility of cotransport activity for GLUT12. Preliminary electrophysiological experiments in oocytes expressing the transporter demonstrated the presence of Na+ currents at saturating sugar concentrations. The inhibition studies performed in transfected cells showed sensitivity of GLUT12 to cytochalasin B and inhibitors of GLUT1 like genistein, quercetin and tyrphostin A47. Based on these results, we suggest that GLUT12 could function as a cotransporter like the H+/myoinositol transporter, which also belongs to class III. Work in progress will allow us to characterize more deeply this transporter.",NA,"*intestine absorption *human oocyte kinetics assay Xenopus laevis sugar transport pH mammal cell amino acid sequence breast cancer cancer cell culture cell strain *cotransporter *glucose sodium 3 methylglucose sugar cytochalasin B genistein quercetin tyrphostin inositol glucose transporter membrane protein","S71","5","2010",-1

However, results from clinical trials of equol have not been published. This study aimed to investigate the effects of equol on bone metabolism as well as serum sex and thyroid hormone levels in postmenopausal Japanese women. Design: We performed a 1-year double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial with natural S-equol supplement for 93 equol non- producing menopausal Japanese women. Subjects were randomly assigned to four groups; placebo, 2 mg of equol per day (EQ-2), 6 mg of equol per day (EQ-6) and 10 mg of equol per day (EQ-10). Results: The mean age, year since menopause, body weight, and height of the study subjects at baseline were 53.8 + 3.7 years old, 2.7 +1.2 years, 54.1 + 8.2 kg, and 156.8 + 4.9 cm, respectively. There were no major differences in those among the different groups at baseline. Twelve months of equol intervention did not affect these characteristic. Equol intervention increased equol concentrations in serum and urine in a dose-dependent manner. Urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) was significantly decreased of -23.94 % change in the EQ-10 group as compared with those of -2.87 % change in the placebo group after 12 months of intervention (P=0.020). Repeated measured ANOVA showed that the urinary DPD concentration in the EQ-10 group at 12 months was significantly lower than that at baseline (P=0.001). Thus, lOmg a day of equol supplement markedly inhibited bone resorption. Additionally, the percent change in whole body BMD in EQ-10 group was -1.10 %, which was significantly different as compared with that of -1.88 % in the placebo group (P=0.027). Thus, treatment with 10 mg a day of equol prevented a decrease in whole body BMD postmenopausal women after 12 months. Serum sex and thyroid hormone concentrations did not differ among four groups after intervention. Conclusion: This is the first study to show specific evidence of equol for bone metabolism in humans.

Design: A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial was carried out to evaluate 60 women (mean age: 52.4 years). These women were randomized into three groups: one group received a soy-based dietary supplement (isoflavone 90mg/day), another received HT (estradiol lmg and noretisterone acetate 0.5mg) and a control group received a placebo for a period of 16 weeks. Urinary, vaginal and sexual complaints were evaluated by using the urogenital subscale of the Menopause Rating Scale. Genital bleeding pattern was assessed. Measurements of the vaginal pH and endometrial thickness were performed by transvaginal ultrasound. Vaginal hormone cytology was collected for calculation of the maturation index. For statistical analysis, the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Kruskal-Wallis test were use Results: There was a significant improvement in vaginal dryness in the soy group and in the HT group (p=0.04).

Aso","Safety assessments of natural S-equol supplement by consecutive ingestion to postmenopausal Japanese women","Objective: Soy contains three isoflavones: daidzein, genistein and glycitein. Equol, a non-steroidal estrogen, is an active metabolite of the daidzein isoflavone, but it has been reported that approximately half of the Japanese population and 70-80% of the US population cannot produce equol after ingesting soy foods or consuming soy isoflavones directly. The ability to produce equol depends on the presence of certain intestinal microorganism. We newly isolated and identified a lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus 20-92, that metabolizes daidzein to equol. Using this strain, we successfully produced a fermented soy food containing natral S-equol. Clinical studies have shown the benifical effects of natural S-equol supplement on menopausal syndrome and bone metabolism in postmenopausal Japanese women. However, the safety of natural S-equol supplement, especially in relation to the reproductive system, has not yet been examined. In the present study, we investigated the effects of natural S-equol on the reproductive systems of Japanese postmenopausal women. Design: The study was conducted with a randomized, placebo-controlled design. Healthy postmenopausal women 45-65 years of age who were equol non-producers and for whom within 5 years had elapsed since the onset of menopause were recruited in the study. One hundred and one women were divided into three groups, namely, EQL10 group (n =34, lOmg of equol/d), EQL30 group (n = 33, 30mg of equol/d), and placebo group (n = 34, Omg of equol/d). Placebo or natural S-equol supplement were orally ingested once daily for 12 weeks. The safety of natural S-equol supplement was assessed by examination of reproductive organs (uterus) and breasts. Blood biochemical test and endocrinological test (sex hormone and thyroid hormone) were carried out at beseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after start of administration. Results: There were no serious adverse events, and no significant differences of frequency among the groups in this study. No abnormal changes in serum concentrations of hormones (estradiol, follicle stimulation hormone, thyroid stimulation hormone, free- triiodothyronine, and free-thyroxine) were observed in any of the groups. The measurement of uterus endometrial thickness by transvaginal ultrasonography and cytological analysis of vaginal epithelium revealed no biological effect of the supplement on reproductive organs. Futuremore, mammography examination results were not significantly different among groups or between baseline and 12 weeks after start of administration. Conclusion: The consecutive ingestion of natural S-equol supplement (30mg of equol/d) for 12 weeks caused no safety problems, particularly in relation to the reproductive system, in this study.

Altavilla","Dual mode of action genistein aglycone, an anti-osteoporotic isoflavone which rebalances bone remodeling","Objective: Osteoporosis results in reduced bone mass & structural deterioration leading to increased fracture risk. Current treatments come with risk profiles which may not be appropriate in some patients. Epidemiological data support a robust relationship between high isoflavone intake, reduced fracture incidence & increased bone mineral density (BMD) in osteoporotic, postmenopausal women. Well-controlled clinical trial results, however, on the effect of isoflavones in bone loss subjects are mixed with several reports showing negative results, while other studies report bone formation. Such conflicts in the literature may be due to the form of isoflavone used which, in the case of negative findings, tend to be food studies containing mixed isoflavones or extracted, purified mixed isoflavones both of which usually are dominated by the glycoside forms of the molecules. A review of current literature, indicates that genistein aglycone appears to be the most effective isoflavone for managing bone loss. Design: Genistein aglycone(54 mg/day) has been tested in clinical trials in combination with calcium carbonate (1000 mg/day) & vitamin D3 (800IU/day) vs placebo (calcium and D3) over 3 years in post-menopausal women with osteopenia/osteoporosis(n=389) (Marini et al. 2007,2008a; D'Anna et al. 2007).

Quantitative ultrasound was used to investigate bone quality of the genistein administered vs placebo group (Atteritano et al. 2008). Safety measures included routine laboratory measures, AE monitoring, digitally determined breast density, BRCA-1 & BRCA-2 expression, sister- chromatid exchange for mutagenesis, endometrial thickness, vaginal cytology, the cardiovascular markers-fibrinogen, F2-isoprostane, fasting glucose & insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homocysteine, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM), soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM) & osteoprotegrin (OPG). Soluble RANKL (sRANKL) levels in relation to OPG were measured in the clinical trial population to determine genistein's mode of action (Marini et al. 2008b). Results: This long-term clinical trial showed that genistein in combination with calcium/vitamin D3 statistically increases BMD -3% per year for lumbar spine & femoral neck. Placebo showed decreases in BMD over the same period of time. Quantitative ultrasound demonstrated statistically better bone quality parameters vs placebo. Bone resorption markers Pyr, Dpyr & CTX were statistically lower & bone formation markers B-ALP & IGF-1 statistically higher in the genistein group. There were no abnormal laboratory measures in either group & mild AEs. By 3 years, genistein statistically lowered total & LDL cholesterol. There were no changes in breast density, endometrial thickness or vaginal cytology in either group. BRCA-1 & BRCA-2 expression were maintained in the genistein group, but statistically lower in the placebo group. Sister chromatid exchange reflecting an antimutagenic effect was statistically lower with genistein. Genistein showed statistically better cardiovascular marker modulation.

Conclusion: Genistein, through a unique anti-osteoporotic dual mode of action, positively regulates bone cell metabolism rebalancing bone turnover towards bone formation. Genistein stimulates osteoblast & inhibits osteoclast function, mainly through the osteoprotegerin-sRANKL system primarily mediated by binding to the beta-estrogen receptor.

Uchiyama","Effects of natural S-equol on tail skin temperature in ovariectomized rats","Objective: Recently, it has been proposed that the primary physiological effects of soy isoflavones may be attributable to equol. Equol, a metabolite of daidzein, is well known to have estrogenic activity, decreasing risk of osteoporosis, menopausal symptoms, and hyperlipidemia in menopausal women. We prepared a fermented soy culture containing S-equol (SE5-OH) produced by the specific equol-producing lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus 20-92. The concentration of natural S-equol in SE5-OH ranged 0.5 to 0.8% and it contained between 0.5 and 0.8% other isoflavonoids (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein). The micronutrient contents of SE5-OH were not significantly different from the original material. The levels of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in SE5-OH were 38.3%, 14.5%, and 26.8%, respectively. In a previous study, we demonstrated that SE5-OH significantly reduced the frequency and severity of hot flush in Japanese post-menopausal women. Thus, in the present study, we set out to determine whether the S-equol contained within SE5-OH was primarily responsible for the reduction of hot flush using an ovariectormy(OVX)-induced elevated tail skin temperature (TST) rat model, which is a suitable model for simulating the symptom of hot flush in postmenopausal women. Design: 130 rats were divided into five groups of 10 or 30 rats as follows. Group 1 underwent a sham operation (sham: n=30) and was treated with vehicle 3 days after the operation, while all other animals underwent bilateral OVX and were then randomly divided into four groups (Groups 2-5) 3 days after the operation and treated as follows. Group 2 (control: n=30) was treated with vehicle. Group 3 was treated with 6 mg/kg/day Permarin, a conjugated estrogen drug (Premarin: n=10). Group 4 was treated with SE5- OH at a dose equivalent to 11.7 mg/kg/day S-equol (SE: n=30). Group 5 was treated with natural S-equol at the same dose as Group 4 (S-equol: n=30). All rats were given oral dosing for 38 day. TST was measured every week from 3 to 5 weeks after the operation. Results: The TST in OVX rats (control group) was markedly elevated compared with that in Sham rats, while Premarin treatment significantly reduced the elevation of the TST compared with the vehicle group. Natural S-equol treatment and SE5-OH treatment equally suppressed TST in OVX rats. Six weeks after the operation, plasma E2 levels in OVX rats were significantly reduced compared with that in Sham rats, but Premarin treatment significantly increased E2 levels in comparison with the control group. However, SE5-OH treatment and natural S-equol treatment had no effect on E2 level in OVX rats, and there were no differences between the SE5-OH and natural S-equol treatment groups in E2 levels. Both SE5-OH and natural S-equol dramatically differed from Premarin in their lack of estrogenic effects on uterine weight, although the uterine weights for rats treated with SE5-OH and natural S-equol were slightly larger than those of control group. Conclusion: Natural S-equol (11.7 mg/kg/day) suppressed ovariectomy- induced TST, with almost the same efficacy as SE5-OH (at the equivalent of 11.7 mg/kg/day of natural S-equol). Furthermore, both SE5-OH and natural S-equol had little effect on reproductive hormones and organs at doses effective for suppressing TST elevation. These results suggest that natural S-equol is safe and is the primary substance in SE5-OH responsible for reducing hot flush. Therefore, natural S-equol contained in SE5-OH may have contributed to reduction of hot flush in post-menopausal Japanese women in the previous human study.",NA,"*rat *society *menopause *skin temperature hot flush female control group model uterus weight Japanese Lactococcus postmenopause sham procedure plasma ovariectomy human metabolite risk osteoporosis hyperlipidemia lactic acid bacterium *equol conjugated estrogen daidzein genistein glycitein protein trace element hormone isoflavone derivative carbohydrate","1225","17","2010",1

Limited data from case-control studies have shown an association between adolescent soy intake and breast cancer. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that high life-time intake of soy foods, particularly at an earlier age, has a protective effect on high risk mammographic density. Design: This was a population-based cohort study of 817 Chinese premenopausal women aged 35 to 45 years recruited through stratified-cluster sampling from different housing types in Shatin District in Hong Kong. Current soy intake over the past year (T4) was assessed based on validated soy food frequency questionnaire. Intakes of soy foods during childhood (6-12 y) (Tl), adolescents (13-18 y) (T2), and young adulthood (20-34 y) (T3) were also assessed with the assistance of the life-history calendar. Data on potential confounding variables including anthropometric, reproductive and lifestyle factors were also collected based on standardized measurements and interview administered structured questionnaire. Percent mammographic density (MD), based on the digitized image of the mammogram taken from the cranio-caudal view of the breast, was quantitatively assessed by a computer assisted method using the Cumulus4 software. Results: Using a cut-off of <26% and 26% MD, women of the high MD group had statistically significantly (p<0.05) younger mean age, lower body weight, lower waist circumference, older age at first birth, and fewer number of live births. Univariate logistic regression analyses showed that compared with women in the lowest intake quartile of soy, those in the highest intake quartile had a 50% lower risk of belonging to the i26%MD group. The respective ORs for comparing the intakes during T4, T3, T2 and Tl were 0.49 (95% CI 0.24-0.98), 0.47 (95% CI 0.25-0.88), 0.57 (95% CI 0.30-1.08), 0.88 (95% CI 0.47-1.68). High intake at T2 combined with high current intake at T4 further potentiated the protective effect with an OR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.14-0.96) when compared with women with low soy intake during both time points. This OR estimate remained similar after adjusting for the potential confounders.

"1211","1108"," S. Barnes","What are soy isoflavones and what are their molecular, cellular and physiologic effects?","Isoflavones are members of the plant polyphenols family and are found in greatest amounts in tropical legumes. Soybeans, and hence most soy foods and dietary supplements contain significant quantities of the isoflavones, daidzein, genistein and to a lesser extent glycitein. Isoflavones are also found in manufactured foods, soups, tunafish, bread and dairy products. In the unprocessed soybean, isoflavones are mostly as 6-0- malonyl-p-glucosides. Hot water extraction to recover soy milk and then precipitation to tofu leads to the loss of the malonyl ester group. The simple (3-glucosides are readily further hydrolyzed by intestinal enzymes and bacteria, releasing the isoflavone aglycones. Fermentation of soy to make miso, soy sauce, soy paste and tempeh also cause hydrolysis to the aglycones. The aglycones are well absorbed through the intestinal wall although they are largely immediately converted to p-glucuronides and sulfate esters. Heating of soy in the dry state causes decarboxylation of the malonate group to form an acetate. Both the 6-0-acetyl and 6-0-malonyl-p-glucosides are poorly digested in the small intestine and enter the large bowel. Anerobic bacteria reduce daidzein to dihydrodaidzein and in about one third of cases to S-(-)-equol. Ring opening of daidzein to form desmethylangolensin also occurs, as does further ring cleavage reactions to form p- ethylphenol and hydroxyphenol propionic acid. In vitro and cell culture assays as well as nude mice, genistein exhibits weak estrogen-like properties. It has bone-sparing properties in ovariectomized mice. It binds strongly to estrogen receptor (3, although the role of this receptor is not clear. However, it has other mechanisms of action - these include as an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases and tumor necrosis factor a, as a weak antioxidant, and as a potent agonist of the peroxisome proliferation receptor y. Genistein is a strong activator of interferon-y production. Isoflavones may also play a role in soaking up excess oxidants (HOC1 and ON02-) produced by activated neutrophils and macrophages. Isoflavones and other polyphenols are associated with the prevention of breast cancer, an event that may require exposure to isoflavones during early stages of one's life. Isoflavones, in particular genistein, are being used as complementary agents along with radiation and chemotherapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancer.",NA,"*society *menopause soybean bacterium paste hydrolysis intestine wall heating decarboxylation small intestine large intestine ring opening in vitro study cell culture assay nude mouse bone mouse agonist peroxisome neutrophil macrophage prevention breast cancer exposure plant legume diet supplementation food bread neoplasm dairy product extraction soybean milk precipitation fermentation radiation *isoflavone derivative genistein daidzein glucoside receptor glucuronide sulfate malonic acid acetic acid equol propionic acid estrogen estrogen receptor protein tyrosine kinase tumor necrosis factor antioxidant interferon factor A oxidizing agent glycitein hot water ester intestine enzyme isoflavone","1215","17","2010",-1

Burton","Glycoprotein secretions from endometrial glands alter in pregnancy with the loss of specific terminal sialic acid residues","Introduction: Histiotrophe is known to be an important feature of early human pregnancy, providing nutrients and growth factors to the developing embryo. Our aim was to examine the glycan composition of histiotrophe from first trimester decidua basalis and parietalis and to compare it with secretions present in endometrial glands in the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. Methods: Twenty samples of decidua from pregnancies terminated between 8 and 11 weeks were processed into epoxy resin and sections stained with a panel of 22 lectins, together with six late-secretory phase endometrial biopsies. Specimens were analysed using a semi-quantitative ranking system and the density of lectin binding to the glandular secretions and the epithelium assessed. Results: Histiotroph contained terminal s-galactose, alpha-N-acetyl galactosamine and N-acetyl lactosamine residues bound by Arachis hypogaea (AHA), Glycine max (soybean, SBA), Helix pomatia (HPA) and Erythrina crystagalli (ECA) agglutinins, whereas in late secretory phase endometrial gland secretions terminal non-reducing sialic acid was present, inhibiting lectin binding. This suggests that, in histiotrophe, there is loss of the capping sialic acid residues present in the non-pregnant state. No differences in glycosylation were apparent between decidua basalis and parietalis. Despite these changes, sialic acid could still be detected. Conclusions: There is suppression of terminal sialylation in specific oligosaccharide chains in early pregnancy, suggesting that endometrial glycan biosynthesis is modified in response to placental signals. These changes may facilitate absorption of histiotrophe by the trophoblast and enhance availability of substrates for degradation.",NA,"*placenta *secretions *decidua *glycosylation *pregnancy *endometrium lectin binding first trimester pregnancy soybean sialylation biosynthesis absorption human nutrient embryo menstrual cycle endometrium biopsy density epithelium peanut Helix pomatia Erythrina trophoblast *sialic acid *glycoprotein glycan oligosaccharide epoxy resin lectin growth factor galactose n acetylgalactosamine agglutinin","A101","31","2010",-1

Sardao","Antioxidant effects of selected phytoestrogens in brain and liver mitochondria","Phytoestrogens (PEs) are diphenolic natural-occurring compounds that bind to estrogen receptors, with consequent estrogen and antiestrogen effects. As other phenolics, PEs may act as antioxidants through hydrogen/electron donation via hydroxyl groups. PEs have been proposed for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, although without the adverse effects in breast and uterus observed during conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Some controversy exists regarding the use of PEs as food supplements or as alternative to the HRT. In this work, selected phytoestrogens (coumestrol, enterodiol, enterolactone and resveratrol) were compared with 17beta-Estradiol (E2) in terms of protection against rat brain and liver mitochondrial lipid peroxidation and hydroperoxyde production by the respiratory chain in both male and female genders. Coumesterol and resveratrol decreased mitochondrial lipid peroxidation induced by ADP-Fe. H2O2 production by respiring brain mitochondria are increased by E2, enterolactone and resveratrol in preparations from female rats and by E2 and resveratrol in preparations from male rats. Basal hydroperoxydes levels are lower in female tissues than in male tissues. In energized mitochondria, the differences are smaller between genders in both tissues. We observed a lower production of hydroperoxydes in the presence of resveratrol and a slight increase in the presence of E2 compared to the basal levels. In studies using complex I and III inhibitors, we hypothesize that the effects induced by these compounds are mediated by mitochondrial complexes function. According to the obtained results, we conclude that some phytoestrogens (as resveratrol) have protective effects against lipid peroxidation. We also suggest that some PEs might affect mitochondrial function, therefore more studies are needed to evaluate its use as food additive or as alternative to the hormone replacement therapy.",NA,"*brain *liver mitochondrion *society lipid peroxidation tissue rat female male hormone substitution gender prevention postmenopause osteoporosis cardiovascular disease adverse drug reaction breast diet supplementation protection liver respiratory chain brain mitochondrion mitochondrion uterus *phytoestrogen *antioxidant *free radical resveratrol enterolactone hydroxyl group adenosine diphosphate coumestrol enterodiol estradiol iron hydrogen peroxide food additive estrogen receptor estrogen antiestrogen","S191","49","2010",-1

In addition to their toxic effects, many have been shown to mimic or to interfere with the actions of estrogen (E2). Certain metal ions behave as xenoestrogens and are termed metalloestrogens one of which is cadmium. Studies showed that lignans from sesame seed possess phytoestrogenic activity. Uses of phytoestrogen-rich natural products as hormone supplement therapy and chemopreventive agents are currently increasing. Therefore, interaction of metalloestrogen and phytoestrogen on hormone-dependent diseases such as breast cancer is of concern. In this present study, the interac tive effect between sesamol (SM) a lignan from sesame seed and heavy metal cadmium chloride (CdCl2) on growth and estrogen signaling of the hormone-dependent human breast cancer T47D cells are investigated. In the absence of E2, SM (200 and 500muM) and CdCl2 (5-40muM) induced in vitro proliferation of T47D cells. Luciferase reporter assay revealed induction of estrogen responsive element (ERE) by both SM and CdCl2 suggesting estrogenic activity of both chemicals. However, SM reduced E2-induced ERE activation whereas CdCl2 enhanced it. Western Blot analysis revealed an up-regulation in estrogen receptor alpha (ERmu) protein expression levels after 24 h treatment with 5muMof CdCl2. In contrast, a downregulation in expression level of ERmu protein was observed after SM treatment. Moreover, SM can counteract the effect of CdCl2 on both ERE activation and induction of ERmu protein expression. In conclusion, both SM and CdCl2 exhibit estrogenic activity and induce growth of T47D cells. However, the two chemicals have different effect on ERmu protein expression and the phytoestrogen SM can attenuate the estrogenic activity of the metalloestrogen CdCl2.",NA,"*breast cancer *human *sesame *plant seed *toxicology *cancer cell protein expression estrogen responsive element dangerous goods food household therapy in vitro study assay Western blotting upregulation toxicity *cadmium hormone phytoestrogen estrogen lignan drinking water estrogen receptor alpha metal ion natural product protein metformin plus rosiglitazone heavy metal luciferase cadmium chloride","S311-S312","196","2010",-1
"1221","1114"," S. Makela","Steroid hormone receptors and metabolism in endocrine disruption","Numerous dietary compounds interacting with steroid hormone receptors (SRs) or steroid hormone metabolizing enzymes have been identified to date. These compounds vary enormously with respect to their chemical structures, sources of exposure, as well as their biological activities. Collectively, they may be called steroid hormone modulators (SHMs). SHMs may be of natural origin (e.g. phytoestrogens) or synthetic, and they are postulated to exert both beneficial and adverse effects on human health by modulating e.g. the development, maturation and function of reproductive system, or the risk of breast and prostate cancer. There are several factors that determine the consequences of exposure to SHMs, including the age at exposure, the mixture of SHMs, and their dose-response dynamics. Consequently, comprehensive assessment of the health effects of the variable SHM mixtures present in our environment and/or diet is challenging. Understanding of the mechanisms and targets of SHMs is of key importance. Modulation of steroid hormone action may occur via several mechanisms, including the direct interaction with SRs and transcription machinery associated with SR signaling, as well as modulation ofsteroid hormone metabolism. Various in vitro assays are available for the investigation of hormonal modulation, resulting in the identification of numerous potential SHMs. However, it is obvious that results obtained in vitro, using single pure compounds, often poorly predict the actual in vivo effects, occurring through complex exposure patterns (e.g., a low-dose and long-term exposure to a complex mixture of SHMs in a complex food matrix). It is thus pertinent to ask what would be the appropriate testing strategy for the identification of SHMs that are likely to cause endocrine disruption? In this presentation, focus will be on novel in vivo models for the investigation of estrogen action, used for studying the hormone-modulatory effects of complex food matrices containing mixtures of SHMs.",NA,"*toxicology *metabolism exposure date (fruit) modulation in vitro study food health hormone metabolism assay low drug dose long term exposure diet drug mixture model estrogen activity chemical structure biological activity adverse drug reaction maturation genital system risk breast prostate cancer dose response dynamics environment hormone action machine human *steroid receptor steroid hormone hormone enzyme phytoestrogen","S12","196","2010",-1

The aim of this study was to assess the relation between food allergy and pediatric constipation and to determine the timing of achieving tolerance in these patients. METHODS: Fifty-four children aged 6 months to 11 years (median age 25 months) with chronic constipation, not responding to 3 months laxative therapy, were included (group I). Anatomic abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and celiac disease were excluded. As controls were used twenty age and sex matched, apparently healthy, infants and children (group II). Serum specific IgEs to cow milk, egg, wheat, rice, corn, and soy were measured with the CAP-FEIA. Skin prick tests and atopy patch tests (using fresh foods) were performed for the same allergens. RESULTS: All children in the control group had negative CAP, SPT and APT to all food allergens. In group I 26/54 children (48%) had positive APT. Of these, 10/26 (38%) were APT and CAP positive, while 8/26 (30%) were APT and SPT positive. Of the 26 APT positive children 8 (8/26, 30%) had positive APT to one food allergen, 10/26 (38%) had positive APT to two food allergens and 8/26 (30%) to 3 or more food allergens. Positive APT to egg was found in 17/26 (65%), to wheat in 16/26 (61%), to soy in 9/26 (34%), to cow milk in 8/26 (30%), to rice in 4/ 26(15%) and to corn in 3/26 (11%).

Treeck","Additive effects of trastuzumab and genistein on human breast cancer cells","Objective: Women with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer are treated with trastuzumab. Genistein is a phytoestrogen and natural tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can inhibit growth of breast cancer cells. Genistein is an agonist of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), which is able to exert antitumoral functions. Considering these pleiotropic effects on breast cancer cells, a combined treatment with genistein and trastuzumab could be a promising therapeutic approach. In this in vitro study, we tested to what extent genistein would be able to enhance the antitumoral action of trastuzumab. Materials and methods: First we characterized the HER2-, ERbeta1-, ERbeta2-, ERbeta5- and ERalpha-expression in the three breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3, BT-474 and MDA-MB-231 by real time RT-PCR. With a proliferation assay, we measured the influence of combinations of ERalpha-agonist (PPT), ERbeta-agonist (DPN) or genistein with trastuzumab on the growth of these cell lines over a time span of six days. Relevant gene changes were measured by PCR. Results: Treatment with genistein (10 muM) significantly increased the growth-inhibitory effect of trastuzumab on HER2-overexpressing, ERalpha/beta-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells, but not on ERalpha-negative SK-BR-3 cells. ERbeta agonist DPN exerted similar effects on trastuzumab- treated BT-474 cells. In contrast, neither addition of 17-beta estradiol, ERa agonist PPT nor tamoxifen did affect the antiproliferative action of trastuzumab. On the molecular level, treatment with genistein reduced HER2 transcript levels and inhibited trastuzumabtriggered upregulation of ERa- and c-fos expression. Though both drugs inhibited expression of proliferation genes Ki-67 and MYBL2, no additive effect was observed. Both drugs notably increased ERbeta2 transcript levels, and their combination further elevated mRNA levels of this receptor variant.

Numerous of them are non-steroidal phytoestrogens, classified to lignans, isoflavonoids and coumestans. Within 2 interdisciplinary research projects (Deutsche Krebsstiftung, BMBF) plant derived substances and food ingredients were proved systematically regarding their anti cancer effects under in vitro conditions by means of different breast cancer cell lines. Expected results have meaning for the nourishing medicine, the development of phytomedicine, e.g. development from screenings to the determination of estrogen receptor modulators, structural analysis and structure design. Materials and methods: Project 1: At first, investigation of molecular and cell biological to prove mechanisms of established and potential phytoestrogens as a condition for the development of strategies in cancer prevention and therapy. Present conditions: extraction, substance analysis, testing of extracts and lignans in cell culture models. At present technologies are compiled to resuming cracking steps by excerpts of the flax root. Project 2: Innovative regional competence for the development of biofunctional food ingredients from lupins seed. Results: According to the method of Lyengi it was possible to enriched lignans. The analysis of secondary derived substances was carried out by Pyrolysis Field Ionization Mass Spectrometry: lignans, flavonoids, terpenes, sterols, peptides among others. At different concentrations it could be estimate antiproliferative effects of flax root extractions; control substances were estradiol and tamoxifen. The antiproliferative effects were present at ER positive and ER negative cell lines. Root extract from L. usitatissimum at concentrations of 0.01 mug/ml to 50 mug/ml didn't have significant cytotoxic effects to MCF7 and BT20 cells.

Gurer-Orhan","Prooxidant and antioxidant effects of three dietary flavonoids and their mixtures","Dietary flavonoids have gained a reputation for being antioxidants and beneficial on breast cancer, prostate cancer, menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. On the other hand several studies have demonstrated that flavonoids exert biphasic effects; they can also act as prooxidant and procarcinogen. In the present study, in vitro antioxidant and/or prooxidant capacity of three dietary flavonoids; genistein, daidzein and quercetin was evaluated by the examination of their ability to produce/inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation by using a fluorescent probe, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein. Individually genistein and daidzein both induced formation of ROS in red blood cells in a concentration dependent manner in the presence and absence of ""transient metals and H2O2"" while they inhibited ROS formation in a microsome model where their metabolites were formed. The combinational effect of two flavonoids had a similar effect pattern. However, both effects in both models were observed at high concentrations of flavonoids that were not physiologically relevant. Quercetin showed significant antioxidant effects even at its lowest concentrations (1muM) in both RBCs and microsomes and in every condition tested (in the presence and absence of ""transition metals and H2O2""). Another major finding of the present study is that the prooxidant effect of genistein and daidzein were suppressed by quercetin in a mixture of three at physiologically relevant concentrations. A total antioxidant effect was observed with the mixture of three both in RBCs and microsomes. Similar prooxidant effects of genistein and daidzein which were prevented by quercetin in a mixture of three was also observed in an oxidative hemolysis model initiated by a water-soluble free radical initiator 2,2-azo(2-asmidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH). Our study indicated that flavonoids can act as a prooxidant as well as an antioxidant depending on their concentrations and the incubation conditions. The present study also points to the importance of considering the mixture effect while evaluating possible risks of dietary flavonoids.",NA,"microsome model metabolite hemolysis examination risk breast cancer osteoporosis cardiovascular disease in vitro study erythrocyte prostate cancer *flavonoid *antioxidant daidzein genistein quercetin hydrogen peroxide transition element water free radical reactive oxygen metabolite fluorescent dye dichlorofluorescein metal","176","42","2010",-1

We present here a comparison of pre- and post-diagnostic dietary intake and supplement use reported by 1760 participants. Methods: Twosemi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires were administered to participants at study entry (approximately one year after diagnosis) one representing usual diet before diagnosis and the other, after diagnosis until study recruitment. Consumption of food groups and daily intake of macro- and micro-nutrients derived by nutritional software program analysis was evaluated. Supplement use was also examined. Results: Consumption of fruit and vegetables, lean protein sources, tea, wholegrain foods and nuts was significantly increased post-diagnosis (p < 0.05). Concurrently, intake of red meat, refined grain products, high-fat and high-sugar foods, coffee and some alcoholic drinks was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Dietary intake of retinol and calcium decreased after diagnosis but intake of other vitamins and minerals increased (p < 0.05). Supplement use was prevalent in this cohort with 59% reporting use before diagnosis. A change in behaviour was observed following diagnosis with 10.3% of women stopping all supplements and 15.3% starting use. Fish oils, multivitamin and mineral products, evening primrose oil, vitamin C, glucosamine, calcium and estrogenic botanical supplements (EBS) were most commonly used with increases after diagnosis being statistically significantly (p < 0.05). A third of named EBS referred to use for menopausal or hormone-related symptoms. Flaxseed, isoflavone containing supplements, ginseng, and red clover were the most popular. 3.6% of participants took EBS before diagnosis, but numbers of users increased significantly (9.7%) following diagnosis.

An increase in phytoestrogen research over the past few decades has demonstrated the biological complexity of phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens can bind to estrogen receptors (ERs) and mimic some actions of human estrogen through the activation or inactivation of certain genes.Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a major component extracted from a traditional herbal medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza BUNGE, has been implicated as a chemopreventive agent against breast cancer. However, the mechanisms behind it cancer-protective effects are not clear. The goal of this study was to determine whether the antiproliferative action of this compound on breast cancer cell (MCF-7) is mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs). The percentage of cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. It was found that Tan IIA exhibited antiproliferative effects in MCF-7 cells in the range of 10-6M-10-5M. In RT-PCR assay, Tan IIA(10-5M) was found to inhibit pS2 expression at 6h (0.35 + 0.27- fold), at 24h (0.80 + 0.32-fold) when compared to untreated control. In transfection assay, Hela cells were co-transfected with pERE-luc, pTKRen, ER-alpha or ER-beta, Tan IIA(10-6M-10-5M) decreased the ER-alpha transactivation.

We tried to investigate the inhibitory effects of reconstituted HDL (rHDL) on restenosis and its mechanism of action. Methods and Results: rHDL was prepared with plasma-derived apoA-I and soybean PC by a molar ratio of 1 to 150. To induce neointima formation, the endothelium was denuded with balloon catheter in the right carotid artery of SD rats (n = 10). rHDL administration was started 4hr before surgery and continued two consecutive days after carotid injury. Two weeks later, arteries were isolated from rats and neointima formation was assessed by H&E staining. Intima to media ratios was 20-fold in 40mg/kg rHDL treated group (p = 0.4) and 25-fold lower in 80mg/kg rHDL treated group (p < 0.006) than in control group. Immunohistochemistry revealed that significant reduction of Ki-67 signal in neointima but increase of the signal in endothelial area. HO1 is increased in neointima of all injured groups. Overall expression of HSP27 was not changed but phosphorylation of HSP27 was not shown in those of rHDL treated groups. In addition, strong CD68 signals in carotid arteries are dramatically diminished in injured lesions of rHDL treated groups. Conclusions: rHDL effectively stabilized restenosis by inhibiting celll cycle and inflammation in injured lesions. HO1 and phosphorylation of HSP27 might play a role in ameliorating the progression of restenosis in balloon-injured rat carotid artery.",NA,"*carotid artery *restenosis *rat intima phosphorylation plasma artery staining control group immunohistochemistry inflammation prevention soybean endothelium balloon catheter Sprague Dawley rat surgery injury cardiovascular disease *high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein","31","11","2010",-1

Scientific literature indicates a preventive role of isoflavones in cancer. Since activation of HER-2 receptor initiates growth-promoting events in cancer cells, we studied the effect of biochanin A (an isoflavone) on associated signaling events like receptor activation, downstream signaling, and invasive pathways. HER-2-positive SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells, MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells, and NIH-3T3 normal fibroblast cells were treated with biochanin A (2-100 muM) for 72 hours. Subsequently cell viability assay, western blotting and zymography were carried out. The data indicate that biochanin A inhibits cell viability, signaling pathways, and invasive enzyme expression and activity in SK-BR-3 cancer cells. Biochanin A did not inhibit MCF-10A and NIH-3T3 cell viability. Therefore, biochanin A could be a unique natural anticancer agent which can selectively target cancer cells and inhibit multiple signaling pathways in HER-2-positive breast cancer cells.

With the availability of high-throughput genomics technologies and the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, we are now in the postgenomics era. This transition is increasingly marked with study of polygenic and multifactorial traits such as common complex human diseases as well as pharmacodynamic differences among populations. Changes that emerge from postgenomics medicine are not, however, limited to seismic shifts in scale and scope of pharmacogenetics research. Importantly, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) of the South, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East are becoming notable contributors with rapid globalization of science and increasing access to genomics technologies. This brings about, in parallel, an acute demand for regional capacity building in LMICs so that the future evaluation and implementation of postgenomics technologies in personalized medicine take place in an integrated, sustainable and equitable manner. With this overarching vision, we herein report the founding of the Istanbul Working Group in Personalized Medicine (IWG-PM, represented by the authors of this report) that was inaugurated as a component of the 2nd Symposium on Personalized and Predictive Medicine held in Istanbul, sponsored by the Yeditepe University, and the Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council (TUB?TAK) (10-12 September, 2009). While highlighting the applications of personalized medicine in oncology, psychiatry, nutrition, infectious diseases, occupational health, genetic testing and systems biology, the symposium also raised challenging questions in the context of LMICs. How can we best evaluate the promises, intended and unintended impacts of personalized medicine and enabling technologies in the context of Turkey, and the LMICs more generally? IWG-PM is a small but significant and necessary step to initiate regional capacity building in Turkey. We trust that the IWG-PM initiative may also provide a constructive example to further develop capacity in other LMICs in the Eastern Mediterranean region. 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"adjuvant therapy bioequivalence breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/et [Etiology] cancer cell culture colorectal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] conference paper cytology depression/dt [Drug Therapy] diarrhea/si [Side Effect] drug acetylation drug metabolism drug surveillance program gene mutation genetic analysis genetic polymorphism genetic trait genetic variability hemolytic anemia high throughput screening human human genome project *individualization industrialization infection malignant neoplastic disease/dt [Drug Therapy] medical research multidrug resistance neutropenia/si [Side Effect] nutritional health occupational exposure occupational health oncology *patient care *pharmacogenetics psychiatry symposium systems biology tuberculosis/dr [Drug Resistance] tuberculosis/dt [Drug Therapy] Turkey (republic) unspecified side effect/si [Side Effect] Vicia faba 14 hydroxyclarithromycin/pk [Pharmacokinetics] antidepressant agent/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] antidepressant agent/dt [Drug Therapy] BRCA1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] BRCA2 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] clarithromycin/pk [Pharmacokinetics] cytochrome P450/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytochrome P450 2D6/ec [Endogenous Compound] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] fluorouracil/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] fluorouracil/dt [Drug Therapy] gefitinib/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glucuronosyltransferase 1A1/ec [Endogenous Compound] guanosine triphosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] imatinib/dt [Drug Therapy] irinotecan/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] irinotecan/dt [Drug Therapy] mercaptopurine/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] mercaptopurine/dt [Drug Therapy] Rab protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] rituximab/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/pk [Pharmacokinetics] tuberculostatic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] xenobiotic agent/to [Drug Toxicity]","297-301","7","2009",-1

Female rats were fed diets high in n-3 fatty acids (80g/kg diet) or soya protein (765mg/kg diet isoflavones) for 2 weeks, and then killed before the removal of the colon and mammary glands. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were quantified morphologically in whole crypts and terminal end buds. The expressions of ERalpha and ERbeta were measured in colon tissue scrapes and the mammary gland. Fish oil significantly increased apoptosis and decreased mitosis in both tissues, an effect associated with a decrease in the expressions of ERalpha and ERbeta. Soya had no effect on apoptosis in either tissue, but reduced mitosis in the colon (P<0.001) while increasing it in the mammary gland (P=0001). The changes in proliferation were associated with contrasting changes in the ER expression such that fish oil significantly decreased both ERbeta and ERalpha, while soya increased ERalpha and decreased ERbeta.

Mucins are also involved in cancer and metastasis and often express diagnostic cancer antigens. Recently, a modified porcine submaxillary mucin (Tn-PSM) containing GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr residues was shown to bind to soybean agglutinin (SBA) with ~106-fold enhanced affinity relative to GalNAca1-O-Ser, the pancarcinoma carbohydrate antigen. In this study, dynamic force spectroscopy is used to investigate molecular pairs of SBA and Tn-PSM. A number of force jumps that demonstrate unbinding or rebinding events were observed up to a distance equal to 2.0 mum, consistent with the length of the mucin chain. The unbinding force increased from 103 to 402 pN with increasing force loading rate. The position of the activation barrier in the energy landscape of the interaction was 0.1 nm. The lifetime of the SBA-TnPSM complex in the absence of applied force was determined to be in the range 1.3-1.9 s. Kinetic parameters describing the rate of dissociation of other sugar lectin interactions are in the range 3.3 x 10-3-2.5 x 10-3 s. The long lifetime of the SBA-TnPSM complex is compatible with a binding model in which lectin molecules ""bind and jump"" from alpha-GalNAc residue to alpha-GalNAc residue along the polypeptide chain of Tn-PSM before dissociating. These findings have important implications for the molecular recognition properties of mucins. 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NA,"article controlled study covalent bond dissociation constant *molecular dynamics molecular interaction molecular recognition molecular weight nonhuman protein binding protein immobilization protein protein interaction sensitivity and specificity spectroscopy surface property swine mica *mucin n acetylgalactosamine *soybean agglutinin *Tn antigen","719-728","91","2009",-1

The research was carried out on an initial sample of 468 female workers (209 traffic police and 259 controls). After excluding the subjects with confounding factors, 192 female subjects: 96 traffic police and 96 controls were included in the study. Traffic police and controls were matched by age, length of service, body mass index, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking habits, habitual consumption of Italian coffee, and habitual intake of soy and liquorice in diet. The results show that the percentage of subjects with fertility and mental health disorders were no different between traffic police and controls. Mean androstenedione values were significantly higher in female traffic police compared to controls. The distribution into classes of androstenedione values in traffic police was statistically significant. The percentage of traffic police with fertility and mental health disorders were not significant compared to controls. Our results suggest that the occupational exposure to urban stressors could alter plasma androstenedione levels in female traffic police. According to our previous research all the hormonal parameters studied, including androstenedione, could be used as early biological markers of chronic exposure to urban stressors, usable in occupational sets.

The use of phytoestrogen containing herbal medicines is limited because of efficacy and safety concerns. The ER+ MCF-7 model examined growth inhibitory effects of the medicinal herb Lycium barbarum (LB) and identified mechanistic leads for its efficacy. The MCF-7 cells maintained in 0.7% serum (17-estradiol, E2 1 nM) exhibited 11%-87% increased growth after treatment with 1nM to 20 nM E2. Growth promotion with 20 nM E2 exhibited 5.2-fold increased estrone (E1), 35.7% increased 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1), 15.4% increased 16 -hydroxyestrone (16 -OHE1), and eightfold increased estriol (E3) formation. Treatment of E2 stimulated cells with LB exhibited a dose-dependent growth inhibition of 9.5%-42.8% at Day 3 and 33.9%-83.9% at Day 7. The 3-day inhibitory response to 1% LB (maximum cytostatic concentration) exhibited 84.8% increased E1, 3.6-fold increased 2-OHE1, 33.3% decreased 16 -OHE1, and 9.2-fold increased E3 formation.

A total of 134 patients were randomly allocated to each treatment group (67 each). The PE group needed significantly fewer days for adequate follicular maturation, had a thicker endometrium and higher oestradiol concentration at the time of human chorionic gonadotrophin injection (all P < 0.001). The PE group had higher luteal-phase serum progesterone compared with the EE group. No significant difference was found regarding clinical pregnancy rates (14.0% versus 21.1%, respectively).

In soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill], several associations between photosensitivity and maturity loci are known, but only limited information at the molecular level is available. The FT3 locus is one of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flowering time that corresponds to the maturity locus E3. To identify the gene responsible for this QTL, a map-based cloning strategy was undertaken. One phytochrome A gene (GmPhyA3) was considered a strong candidate for the FT3 locus. Allelism tests and gene sequence comparisons showed that alleles of Misuzudaizu (FT3/FT3; JP28856) and Harosoy (E3/E3; PI548573) were identical. The GmPhyA3 alleles of Moshidou Gong 503 (ft3/ft3; JP27603) and L62-667 (e3/e3; PI547716) showed weak or complete loss of function, respectively. High red/far-red (R/FR) long-day conditions enhanced the effects of the E3/FT3 alleles in various genetic backgrounds. Moreover, a mutant line harboring the nonfunctional GmPhyA3 flowered earlier than the original Bay (E3/E3; PI553043) under similar conditions. These results suggest that the variation in phytochrome A may contribute to the complex systems of soybean flowering response and geographic adaptation.

Objective: The objective was to evaluate the association of adolescent and adult soy food intake with breast cancer risk in a cohort of 73,223 Chinese women who participated in the Shanghai Women's Health Study. Design: A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess usual dietary intake during adulthood and adolescence. After a mean follow-up of 7.4 y, 592 incident cases of breast cancer were identified for longitudinal analyses by using Cox regressions. Results: Adult soy food consumption, measured either by soy protein or isoflavone intake, was inversely associated with the risk of premenopausal breast cancer, and the association was highly statistically significant (P for trend < 0.001). The multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RRs) for the upper intake quintile compared with the lowest quintile were 0.41 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.70) for soy protein intake and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.73) for isoflavone intake. High intake of soy foods during adolescence was also associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer (RR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.97). Women who consumed a high amount of soy foods consistently during adolescence and adulthood had a substantially reduced risk of breast cancer. No significant association with soy food consumption was found for postmenopausal breast cancer. Conclusion: This large, population-based, prospective cohort study provides strong evidence of a protective effect of soy food intake against premenopausal breast cancer. 2009 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"adolescence adolescent adult article *breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *cancer risk Chinese controlled study female *food intake human major clinical study postmenopause premenopause risk assessment risk reduction *soybean women's health isoflavone soybean protein","1920-1926","89","2009",-1

However, the mechanism underlying their actions has not yet been identified. Objectives: We characterized the estrogenic activity of three active naturally occuring diaryl-heptanoids both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: We characterized mechanisms of estrogenic action of the diarylheptanoids (3S)-1,7-diphenyl-(6E)-6-hepten-3-ol (D1), 1,7-diphenyl-(6E)-6hepten-3=one (D2), and (3R), 1,7--diphenyl-(4E,6E)-4,6-heptadien-3-ol (D3) by using a real-time polymerase chain reacion assay, a mammalian transfection model, and a uterptropic assay in mice. Results: All diarylheptanoids up-regulated estrogen-responsive genes in estrogen-responsive breast cancer cells (MCF-7). In HepG2 cells tranfected with estrogen receptor (ER) beta or different ERalpha functional receptor mutants and the Vit-ERE-TATA-Luc reporter gene, all diarylheptanoids induced with ICI 182,780 (ER antagonist), whereas only D2 was active with ERbeta. An ERalpha mutant lacking the functional AF2 (activation function 2) region was not responsive to 17beta-estradiol (E2) or to any of the diarylheptanoids, whereas ERalpha lacking the AF1 domain exhibited wild-type-like activity. D3 markedly increased uterine weight and proliferation of the uterine epithelium in ovariectomized, mice, whereas D1 and D2 were inactive D3, like E2, up-regulated lactoferrin (Ltf) gene expression. The responses to D3 in the uterus were inhibited by ICI 182,780. In addition, D3 stimulated both classical (Aqp5) and nonclassical (Cdlen1a) ER-mediated gene regulation. Conclusions: The results suggest that the D3 diarylheptanoid is an agonist for ER both in vitro and in vivo, and its biological action is ERalpha selective, specifically requiring AF2 function, and involves direct binding via ER as well as ERE-independent gene regulation.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article cell proliferation cell strain HepG2 cell strain MCF 7 controlled study Curcuma comosa Curcuma longa drug mechanism drug receptor binding drug structure endometrium estrogen activity estrogen responsive element female gene expression regulation human human cell mouse nonhuman nucleotide sequence priority journal real time polymerase chain reaction transcription initiation upregulation uterus weight wild type *1,7 diphenyl 4,6 heptadien 3 ol/an [Drug Analysis] *1,7 diphenyl 4,6 heptadien 3 ol/cm [Drug Comparison] *1,7 diphenyl 4,6 heptadien 3 ol/pd [Pharmacology] *1,7 diphenyl 4,6 heptadien 3 ol/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] *1,7 diphenyl 6 hepten 3 ol/an [Drug Analysis] *1,7 diphenyl 6 hepten 3 ol/pd [Pharmacology] *1,7 diphenyl 6 hepten 3 ol/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] *1,7 diphenyl 6 hepten 3 one/an [Drug Analysis] *1,7 diphenyl 6 hepten 3 one/pd [Pharmacology] *1,7 diphenyl 6 hepten 3 one/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] activating transcription factor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] activating transcription factor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] aquaporin 5/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] fulvestrant *heptane derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *heptane derivative/pd [Pharmacology] lactoferrin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/an [Drug Analysis] *phytoestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","1155-1161","117","2009",-1

Their cytotoxic potential was assessed using MTS assays on MCF-7 breast cancer and CCRFCEM leukaemia cell lines. Results and Conclusion: Introduction of moieties such as chloride, nitrogen, acetoxy and methoxy groups did not help to improve binding affinity, but introduction of tertiary amines improved the binding 1,000-fold due to an improved interaction of the compound with the nucleic acid; replacement of oxygen by sulphur increased the binding 7-fold, possibly because sulphur being less electronegative than oxygen would allow the electrons of the molecule to interact more strongly with the nucleic acid.

Osheroff","The DNA cleavage reaction of topoisomerase II: Wolf in sheep's clothing","Topoisomerase II is an essential enzyme that is required for virtually every process that requires movement of DNA within the nucleus or the opening of the double helix. This enzyme helps to regulate DNA under- and overwinding and removes knots and tangles from the genetic material. In order to carry out its critical physiological functions, topoisomerase II generates transient double-stranded breaks in DNA. Consequently, while necessary for cell survival, the enzyme also has the capacity to fragment the genome. The DNA cleavage/ligation reaction of topoisomerase II is the target for some of the most successful anticancer drugs currently in clinical use. However, this same reaction also is believed to trigger chromosomal translocations that are associated with specific types of leukemia. This article will familiarize the reader with the DNA cleavage/ligation reaction of topoisomerase II and other aspects of its catalytic cycle. In addition, it will discuss the interaction of the enzyme with anticancer drugs and the mechanisms by which these agents increase levels of topoisomerase II-generated DNA strand breaks.

Tolfenamic acid and its metal complexes have been evaluated for antiproliferative activity in vitro against the cells of three human cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line), T24 (bladder cancer cell line), and A-549 (non-small cell lung carcinoma), and a mouse fibroblast L-929 cell line. The complexes [Mn(tolf)2(H2O)2] and [Cu-(tolf)2(H2O)]2 have shown selectivity against T24 cell line.

METHODS: This study used data from Mayo Clinic/North Central Cancer Treatment Group clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of any nonestrogenic agent for hot flashes and had information on breast cancer history or tamoxifen use. Statistically significant changes from the fourth treatment week versus the baseline week, using individual patient data, were assessed using Student's t test. RESULTS: A total of 1,396 women from 20 hot flash studies were eligible for analysis. Overall, women without breast cancer had a similar percentage of baseline hot flash score at week 4, as did those with breast cancer (53% vs 50%, P = 0.92). Women who were not taking tamoxifen had a significantly lower percentage of hot flash score at week 4 as compared with those who used tamoxifen (54% vs 61%, P = 0.01). However, this was due to a higher reduction in hot flash scores in the placebo arms among women not receiving tamoxifen; the percentage reduction in hot flash scores at week 4 from baseline in the active therapy arms of the randomized placebo-controlled trials (ie, excluding placebo arms) was similar among the tamoxifen users and nonusers (difference in mean percentage reduction, 5.7; 95% CI, -1.76 to 13.16).

Zhou","Methylalpinumisoflavone inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) activation by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways","Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors, and the extent of tumor hypoxia correlates with advanced disease stages and treatment resistance. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) represents an important tumor-selective molecular target for anticancer drug discovery directed at tumor hypoxia. A natural product chemistry-based approach was employed to discover small molecule inhibitors of HIF-1. Bioassay-guided isolation of an active lipid extract of the tropical legumaceous plant Lonchocarpus glabrescens and structure elucidation afforded two new HIF-1 inhibitors: alpinumisoflavone (compound 1) and 4'-O-methylalpinumisoflavone (compound 2). In human breast tumor T47D cells, compounds 1 and 2 inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activation with IC50 values of 5 and 0.6 muM, respectively. At the concentrations that inhibited HIF-1 activation,compound 2 inhibited hypoxic induction of HIF-1 target genes (CDKN1A, GLUT-1, and VEGF), tumor angiogenesis in vitro, cell migration, and chemotaxis. Compound 2 inhibits HIF-1 activation by blocking the induction of nuclear HIF-1alpha protein, the oxygen-regulated subunit that controls HIF-1 activity. Mechanistic studies indicate that, unlike rote-none and other mitochondrial inhibitors, compound 2 represents the first small molecule that inhibits HIF-1 activation by simultaneously suppressing mitochondrial respiration and disrupting protein translation in vitro. This unique mechanism distinguishes compound 2 from other small molecule HIF-1 inhibitors that are simple mitochondrial inhibitors or flavanoid-based protein kinase inhibitors. 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,"antiangiogenic activity article breast tumor cancer cell culture *cell hypoxia cell migration cell proliferation cell viability chemotaxis controlled study cytotoxicity test drug isolation drug structure drug targeting enzyme inhibition human human cell IC 50 in vitro study Lonchocarpus glabrescens medicinal plant mitochondrial respiration priority journal protein processing protein secretion protein synthesis inhibition structure analysis *tumor cell destruction tumor vascularization *4'-O-methylalpinumisoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] *4'-O-methylalpinumisoflavone/dv [Drug Development] *4'-O-methylalpinumisoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] *alpinumisoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] *alpinumisoflavone/dv [Drug Development] *alpinumisoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A/ec [Endogenous Compound] glucose transporter 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] *hypoxia inducible factor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] *isoflavone/dv [Drug Development] *isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] lipid/ec [Endogenous Compound] *Lonchocarpus glabrescens extract *plant extract rotenone unclassified drug vasculotropin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","5859-5868","284","2009",-1

Thus, suppression of NF-B has been linked with chemoprevention of cancer. Accumulating findings reveal that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular chaperone and a component of the IB kinase (IKK) complex that plays a central role in NF-B activation. HSP90 also stabilizes key proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis signaling. We have determined whether the exogenous administration of isoflavone-deprived soy peptide prevents 7,12-dimethylbenz[alpha]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary tumorigenesis and investigated the mechanism of action. Dietary administration of soy peptide (3.3 g/rat/day) significantly reduced the incidence of ductal carcinomas (50%), the number of tumors per multiple tumor-bearing rats (49%; P < 0.05), and extended the latency period of tumor development (8.07 + 0.92 weeks) compared to control diet animals (10.80 + 1.30; P < 0.05). Our results have further demonstrated that soy peptide (1) dramatically inhibits the expression of HSP90, thereby suppressing signaling pathway leading to NF-B activation; (2) induces expression of p21, p53, and caspase-3 proteins; and (3) inhibits expression of VEGF. In agreement with our in vivo data, soy peptide treatment inhibited the growth of human breast MCF-7 tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis.

Although the recovery of malnutrition was studied with different high-fat diets, few studies compare the effects of enriched vegetable oil diets, containing PUFA and MUFA, after weaning. Our aim was to evaluate the recovery with soya oil- or rapeseed oil-enriched diet, after malnutrition in rats whose mothers were food restricted (FR) during lactation. Dams were 50% FR and compared to standard diet-fed dams (control, C). At 21 d, FR offspring had a lower body mass and length. After weaning C and FR offspring were fed a diet containing 7% soya oil (7%sC and 7FR), or supplemented with 19% soya oil (19%sC or 19%sFR) or 19% rapeseed oil (19%cC or 19cFR). The normal animals fed enriched vegetable oil diets had more visceral fat mass, but lower serum TAG and higher HDL-cholesterol. The 19%FR groups showed significantly less food intake and body development compared to the 7%sFR, and the same pattern was observed when this group was compared to the C groups. Absolute and relative mass of vital organs and body were lower in the FR groups. Visceral fat depot was lower in 19%FR than 7%FR and C groups. Serum glucose, albumin, TAG, cholesterol, leptin and triiodothyronine did not show significant changes. However, 19%FR groups showed higher HDL-cholesterol and the 19%sFR group showed lower serum thyroxine.

However, phytoestrogen is neuroprotective without these side effects. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Ginsenoside Rg1 on facial neurons and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the facial nucleus in ovariectomized rats. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The randomized, controlled animal experiments were performed at the Ultrasonic Institute, Second Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, China, from September 2007 to September 2008. MATERIALS: Ginsenoside Rg1 (Sigma, USA), rabbit anti-rat BDNF, Bcl-2, Bax antibodies, biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Boster, China), and a TUNEL kit (Roche, Germany) were used in this study. METHODS: A total of 48 adult Sprague Dawley rats undergoing ovariectomy were randomly assigned into sham operation (n = 8), model (n = 20), and Ginsenoside Rg1 (n = 20) groups. Facial nerve damage was induced by bilateral clamping of the facial nerve trunk. The bilateral facial nerve trunk was exposed in the sham operation group, with no clamping. Rats in the Ginsenoside Rg1 group were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg per day Ginsenoside Rg1; other groups received 2 mL saline, once a day, for 14 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Morphologic changes in neurons of the facial nucleus were observed following hematoxylin-eosin staining. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL. Changes in ultrastructure of the facial nerve fibers were observed with a transmission electron microscope. Expression of BDNF, Bcl-2, and Bax protein was quantified by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: At 3-14 days following facial nerve damage, Ginsenoside Rg1 increased BDNF expression and the number of regenerated nerve fibers, and produced thicker myelin sheaths (P < 0.05). Ginsenoside Rg1 also gradually increased Bcl-2 protein expression and decreased Bax protein expression (P < 0.05). By day 7, apoptosis was observed in facial neurons, but Ginsenoside Rg1 reduced the number of apoptotic neurons. Sham animals did not show any changes in BDNF, Bcl-2, or Bax expression or facial neuron morphology. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rg1 can substantially inhibit facial neuronal apoptosis by increasing endogenous BDNF and Bcl-2 expression and by decreasing Bax expression in ovariectomized rats after facial nerve damage.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue apoptosis article controlled study *facial nerve injury/et [Etiology] *facial nerve nucleus female image analysis immunohistochemistry nerve regeneration neuroprotection nick end labeling nonhuman ovariectomy protein expression quantitative analysis rat transmission electron microscopy *brain derived neurotrophic factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *ginsenoside Rg 1/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *ginsenoside Rg 1/pd [Pharmacology] protein Bax/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","383-389","4","2009",-1

We examined the relation between isoflavone supplementation and mammographic density, a strong marker for breast cancer risk, among postmenopausal women. The Osteoporosis Prevention Using Soy (OPUS) study, a multi-site, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo- controlled trial assigned 40+postmenopausal women to 80 or 120 mg/d of isoflavones each or a placebo for 2 y. Percent densities were assessed in digitized mammograms using a computer-assisted method. The mammogram reader did not know the treatment status and the time of mammograms. We applied mixed models to compare breast density by treatment while considering the repeated measures. The mammographic density analysis included 358 women, 88.2% of the OPUS participants; 303 had a complete set of 3 mammograms, 49 had 2, and +had only 1 mammogram. At baseline, the groups were similar in age, BMI, and percent density, but mean breast density differed by study site (P = 0.02). A model with all mammograms did not show a treatment effect on any mammographic measure, but the change over time was significant; breast density decreased by 1.6%/y across groups (P < 0.001). Stratification by age and BMI did not reveal any effects in subgroups. In this randomized 2-y trial, isoflavone supplements did not modify breast density in postmenopausal women. These findings offer reassurance that isoflavones do not act like hormone replacement medication on breast density. 2009 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"adult article body mass *breast clinical trial computer analysis controlled clinical trial controlled study density diet supplementation double blind procedure female human major clinical study *mammography osteoporosis *postmenopause randomized controlled trial *soybean *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] placebo","981-986","139","2009",1

In this study, we examined the effect of dietary equol, a bioactive metabolite of the soy isoflavone daidzein, on equol tissue distribution, bone parameters, and reproductive tissue activity using an adult ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. An 8-wk feeding study was conducted to compare 4 dietary treatments of equol (0, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg diet) in 6-mo-old OVX female Sprague-Dawley rats. A dose response increase in tissue equol concentrations was observed for serum, liver, kidney, and heart, and a plateau occurred at 100 mg equol/kg diet for intestine. In OVX rats receiving 200 mg equol/kg diet, femoral calcium concentration was greater than those receiving lower doses but was still less than SHAM (P < 0.05), and other bone measures were not improved. Tibia calcium concentrations were lower in OVX rats receiving 100 and 200 mg equol/kg diet compared with the OVX control rats. Trabecular bone mineral density of tibia was also lower in equol-fed OVX rats. At this dietary equol intake, uterine weight was higher (P < 0.05) than in other OVX groups but lower than the SHAM-operated intact rats. The 200 mg/kg diet dose of dietary equol significantly increased proliferative index in the uterine epithelium. Dietary equol had no stimulatory effect on mammary gland epithelium. We conclude that in OVX rats, a dietary equol dose that had modest effect on bone also exerts mild uterotropic effects. 2009 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article bone density *bone metabolism breast epithelium cell proliferation controlled study *diet supplementation dietary intake dose response drug activity drug distribution drug dose comparison drug effect drug mechanism drug tissue level endometrium experimental model female femur heart intestine kidney liver nonhuman *ovariectomy parameter rat sham procedure tibia tissue distribution trabecular bone uterus weight calcium/ec [Endogenous Compound] *equol/cr [Drug Concentration] *equol/do [Drug Dose] *equol/po [Oral Drug Administration] *equol/pd [Pharmacology]","1908-1913","139","2009",1

Liu","Current pharmacological approaches to prevent and treat post-menopausal osteoporosis","Osteoporosis characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue; has a huge impact on public health through high morbidity, mortality and economic costs associated with resultant fractures. The prevention and treatment of fragility fractures in the osteoporosis patients worldwide becomes an important issue in the current clinical practice. Women often have an accelerated bone loss after menopause and result in a lower bone mass than men. Since the bone loss is irreversible, early prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is important in the early postmenopausal period. The goal of prevention needs to be not only effective, but also safe, to diminish the risk of vertebral, hip and other nonvertebral fractures. Non-pharmacological treatments, such as calcium, vitamin D, exercise and reduction of risk factors may diminish the impact of menopause and age-mediated bone loss. Current pharmacological options available include bisphosphonates, calcitonin, hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, teriparatide, and strontium ranelate, etc. Lots of natural products including dietary components and herbal products have also been demonstrated to be capable of modifying bone metabolism, particularly of inhibiting bone resorption. These natural products may provide as an alternative treatment for osteoporosis. More than 150 patents have recently been issued for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The development of other new medications also sheds light on either prevention or treatment of osteoporosis, such as human monoclonal anti-RANKL antibody, cathepsin K inhibitors, and cannabinoid-based drugs. 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"article bone mass bone necrosis/si [Side Effect] bone pain/si [Side Effect] breast cancer/si [Side Effect] calcium blood level cerebrovascular accident/si [Side Effect] continuous infusion cost effectiveness analysis deep vein thrombosis/si [Side Effect] dementia/si [Side Effect] dizziness/si [Side Effect] drug approval drug bioavailability drug contraindication drug induced headache/si [Side Effect] drug safety drug tolerability dysphagia/si [Side Effect] environmental factor epistaxis/si [Side Effect] esophagitis/si [Side Effect] esophagus ulcer/si [Side Effect] exercise falling flu like syndrome/si [Side Effect] gastrointestinal symptom/si [Side Effect] heart atrium fibrillation/si [Side Effect] hormonal therapy hot flush/si [Side Effect] human ischemic heart disease/si [Side Effect] leg cramp/si [Side Effect] limb pain/si [Side Effect] musculoskeletal pain/si [Side Effect] myalgia/si [Side Effect] nausea/si [Side Effect] nonhuman orthostatic hypotension/si [Side Effect] phlebitis/si [Side Effect] *postmenopause osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] *postmenopause osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] *postmenopause osteoporosis/th [Therapy] priority journal rhinitis/si [Side Effect] risk factor side effect/si [Side Effect] stomach ulcer/si [Side Effect] vein thrombosis/si [Side Effect] venous thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] visual disorder/si [Side Effect] weight bearing 25 acetylcimigenol xylopyranoside/pd [Pharmacology] adlay/dt [Drug Therapy] alendronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/pk [Pharmacokinetics] bisphosphonic acid derivative/pd [Pharmacology] calcitonin/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] calcitonin/dt [Drug Therapy] calcitonin/na [Intranasal Drug Administration] calcitonin/po [Oral Drug Administration] calcitonin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] calcium/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium carbonate Chinese drug/dt [Drug Therapy] colecalciferol conjugated estrogen estradiol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol plus norethisterone acetate glycoside/pd [Pharmacology] herbaceous agent/dt [Drug Therapy] ibandronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] ibandronic acid/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] ibandronic acid/po [Oral Drug Administration] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] parathyroid hormone[1-34]/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] parathyroid hormone[1-34]/dt [Drug Therapy] parathyroid hormone[1-34]/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] piperazine estrone sulfate raloxifene/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] risedronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] salcatonin soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] unclassified drug vitamin D zoledronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] zoledronic acid/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","42-53","3","2009",-1

Genistein significantly suppressed cell growth of HeLa and CaSki cells at concentrations of 20 and 60 mumol/L, respectively, for 24 h. Western blotting analysis showed that genistein reduced phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 and induced phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Moreover, inhibition of ERK1/2 activity enhanced cell growth inhibition by genistein, whereas inhibition of p38 MAPK activity rescued from genistein-mediated growth inhibition. Interestingly, inhibition of AKT activity recovered genistein-induced growth inhibition in CaSki cells but did not in HeLa cells. However, inhibition of JNK activity seemed to have little effect on cell growth inhibition by genistein.

In this study, we evaluated the apoptotic effect of genistein on cervical cancer cells and its mechanism of apoptosis. Genistein inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer cells (HeLa, CaSki, and C33A). HeLa cells were the most sensitive to genistein, whereas CaSki and C33A cells were less sensitive. Sub-G1 analysis showed that genistein increased apoptotic cells up to 45% at a concentration of 60 mumol/L in HeLa cells, whereas it produced 21% and 17% apoptotic cells in CaSki and C33A cells, respectively, at the same concentration. To determine the apoptotic pathway induced by genistein in the cervical cancer cells, we assessed activation of caspase-3, -8, and -9 by immunoblotting. Procaspase-3, -8, and -9 were decreased and PARP cleavage increased in a time-dependent manner after the treatment of genistein in HeLa cells. Also, inhibition of caspase-3, -8, and -9 with pharmacological inhibitors reduced genistein-mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, inhibition of caspase-8 resulted in remarkable reduction of genistein-induced apoptosis. Bax expression was increased and total bid decreased, whereas bcl-2 level was not changed by genistein. Taken together, these results suggest that genistein could induce apoptosis through both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in human cervical cancer cells. 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.",NA,"antineoplastic activity *apoptosis c33a cell *cancer cell culture CaSki cell cell cycle G1 phase cell line cell proliferation comparative study concentration response conference paper controlled study dose time effect relation drug mechanism drug sensitivity enzyme activation enzyme degradation enzyme inhibition female HeLa cell human human cell human cell culture immunoblotting protein expression signal transduction *uterine cervix cancer benzyloxycarbonylaspartylglutamylvalylaspartyl fluoromethyl ketone benzyloxycarbonylisoleucylglutamylthreonylaspartyl fluoromethyl ketone benzyloxycarbonylleucylglutamylhistidylaspartyl fluoromethyl ketone benzyloxycarbonylvalylalanylaspartyl fluoromethyl ketone caspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase 8/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase 9/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase 9 inhibitor caspase inhibitor *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] procaspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] procaspase 8/ec [Endogenous Compound] procaspase 9/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein Bax/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein Bid/ec [Endogenous Compound]","196-201","1171","2009",-1

We investigated the hypothesis that DHEA metabolism may be increased in a reactive prostate stroma environment in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), and further, whether red clover extract, which contains a variety of compounds including isoflavones, can reverse this effect. LAPC-4 prostate cancer cells were grown in coculture with prostate stromal cells (6S) and treated with DHEA +/- TGFbeta1 or interleukin-6. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression and testosterone secretion in LAPC-4/6S cocultures were compared with those in monocultured epithelial and stromal cells by real-time PCR and/or ELISA. Combined administration of TGFbeta1 + DHEA to cocultures increased PSA protein secretion two to four times, and PSA gene expression up to 50-fold. DHEA + TGFbeta1 also increased coculture production of testosterone over DHEA treatment alone. Red clover isoflavone treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in PSA protein and gene expression and testosterone metabolism induced by TGFbeta1 + DHEA in prostate LAPC-4/6S cocultures. In this coculture model of endocrine-immune-paracrine interactions in the prostate, TGFbeta1 greatly increased stromal-mediated DHEA effects on testosterone production and epithelial cell PSA production, whereas red clover isoflavones reversed these effects. 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.",NA,"antigen expression antineoplastic activity article cancer cell culture cancer growth cell interaction coculture concentration response controlled study dose response *endocrine gland enzyme linked immunosorbent assay epithelium cell gene expression human human cell human cell culture *immune response male monoculture *paracrine signaling *phytochemistry priority journal *prostate protein expression protein secretion reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction stroma cell testosterone metabolism testosterone release interleukin 6 isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] metribolone prasterone prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] red clover extract testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] transforming growth factor beta1","134-142","2","2009",-1

After performing a metaphyseal tibia osteotomy in 96 osteoporotic 5-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats, they received daily 50 mg D, 200 mg 4-MBC or 0.4 mg E2 per kg body weight, or soy free (SF) diet up to 36 and 72 days. Mitochondrial activity, fiber area, and capillary density were analyzed in M. gastrocnemius. Osseous callus bridging of fracture was observed in half of the rats after 36 days. By day 72, fracture was healed in most of the animals. State 3 mitochondrial respiration significantly enhanced in E2, 4-MBC and D groups versus SF after 36 days (30, 32 and 32 vs 23 pmol O2/s per mg). It declined after 72 days, however, in E2 group it was still at a higher level versus SF (25, 23 and 21 vs 20 pmol O2/s per mg). Size of fast oxidative glycolytic (FOG) and fast glycolytic (FG) fibers, capillary density did not differ significantly between the groups, however, at day 36 an increase in D and 4-MBC groups was detectable. FOG diameter was 64, 66, 68, and 58 mum and FG diameter was 88, 98, 95, and 89 mum in SF, D, 4-MBC, and E2 groups. The ratio of capillaries to muscle fiber was 1.1, 1.4, 1.3, and 1.1 in SF, D, 4-MBC and E2 groups by day 36.

Clinical evidence suggests a role for genistein (GEN) aglycone in the prevention of osteoporosis. We investigated whether GEN could prevent GIO as well as the development of osteonecrosis in the femoral head using an experimental rat model. A total of 28 female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. GIO and osteonecrosis were induced by daily s.c. injections of 30 mg/kg of methylprednisolone (MP; n=7). Another group of animals (MP+GEN; n=7) concomitantly received MP (30 mg/kg per s.c.) and GEN aglycone (5 mg/kg per i.p.) for 60 days. Control animals were administered daily with vehicle (VEH) or GEN (5 mg/kg per i.p.) only. At the beginning and end of the treatment, animals were examined for bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC). After killing, serum was collected to determine bone-alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP), carboxy-terminal collagen crosslink (CTX) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels. Femurs were removed and tested for breaking strength and bone histology analyzed for structural quality of the femoral neck. GEN aglycone prevented bone loss as measured by BMD and BMC. Moreover, GEN significantly increased the bone formation markers b-ALP and OPG, reduced the bone resorption marker CTX and statistically maintained comparable strength versus the VEH only group. Finally, histological scoring revealed a protective effect of GEN on bone structure statistically comparable with the VEH control animals. Results suggest that the GEN aglycone might be a preventive treatment for GIO and complications of osteonecrosis with long-term GC treatment. 2009 Society for Endocrinology.",NA,"alkaline phosphatase blood level animal experiment animal model animal tissue article bone density bone mineral bone strength bone structure bone tissue controlled study *corticosteroid induced osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] *corticosteroid induced osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] female *femur head necrosis/dt [Drug Therapy] *femur head necrosis/pc [Prevention] femur neck nonhuman ossification osteolysis priority journal protein blood level protein cross linking alkaline phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] carboxy terminal collagen/ec [Endogenous Compound] carboxy terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein aglycone/cb [Drug Combination] *genistein aglycone/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein aglycone/ip [Intraperitoneal Drug Administration] *genistein aglycone/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] *methylprednisolone/cb [Drug Combination] *methylprednisolone/to [Drug Toxicity] *methylprednisolone/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] osteoprotegerin/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","321-328","201","2009",-1

Comprehensive literature search was conducted through the databases Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), NCCAM (The National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) to identify relevant monographs in English language. Results. Studies have shown that some therapies such as clonidine, selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) and gabapentin are effective in decreasing the degree and frequency of somatic symptoms in menopause, while phytooestrogens and black cohosh have shown mixed results. Use of Ginseng, evening primrose, Dong Quai or vitamin E appears not to be efficacious for the relieving hot flushes. Other effects of these therapies including possible improvements in mood are yet to be substantiated. Inclusion criteria. All available human complementary medicine studies on menopausal women with regard to the relief of menopausal symptoms. Exclusion criteria. Studies not meeting the inclusion criteria, published in languages other than English or animal studies. Conclusion. There is a general lacking of longer-term follow-up beyond the trial lengths of 6-12 weeks in the use of CAM, although women may be taking these medications for many years.

For instance, patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) have a 12-20 increased risk for developing CRC. Preventive strategies utilizing nontoxic natural compounds that modulate immune responses could be successful in the suppression of inflammation-driven colorectal cancer in high-risk groups. The increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR- ) expression and its transcriptional activity has been identified as a target for anti-inflammatory efforts, and the suppression of inflammation-driven colon cancer. PPAR down-modulates inflammation and elicits antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions in epithelial cells. All of which may decrease the risk for inflammation-induced CRC.

Five single nucleotide polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor alpha (rs9340799, rs1913474, and rs2234693) and beta (rs4986938 and rs1256049) genes were genotyped. We found no consistent association between the five single nucleotide polymorphisms and breast cancer risk among the three populations. In analyses of combinations of isoflavone intake and single nucleotide polymorphisms, an inverse association between intake and risk was limited to women with the GG genotype of the rs4986938 polymorphism for postmenopausal Japanese (odds ratio for highest versus lowest tertile = 0.47; P for trend = 0.01), Japanese Brazilians (odds ratio for highest versus lowest median = 0.31) and non-Japanese Brazilians (odds ratio for consumers versus non-consumers = 0.37) (P for interaction = 0.11, 0.08, and 0.21, respectively).

Borst","Intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/Bcrp1 and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3)/Mrp3 are involved in the pharmacokinetics of resveratrol","The phytoestrogen resveratrol has putative health-promoting effects and is present in several dietary constituents. Resveratrol is metabolized extensively in the gut epithelium, resulting in the formation of hydrophilic glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugates. These polar resveratrol conjugates need specific transporters to cross the cell membrane. We show here that vectorial transport of some of these metabolites is mediated by multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3, ABCC3) and/or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) located in the basolateral and apical membranes of enterocytes, respectively. In vitro, MRP3 transports resveratrol-glucuronide (Res-3-G). The absence of Mrp3 in mice results in altered disposition of Res- 3-G and its parent compound resveratrol, leading to a reduced percentage of resveratrol being excreted via the urine in Mrp3(-/-) mice. Circumstantial evidence suggests that circulating resveratrol is formed by deglucuronidating Res-3-G in vivo, providing a possible explanation for the health beneficial effects of resveratrol in vivo, despite its rapid and extensive conjugation. BCRP transports Res-3-G and resveratrol sulfates in vitro, and its absence in mice results in high plasma levels of resveratrol-di-sulfate, a resveratrol metabolite hardly detectable in the plasma of wild-type mice and in an increased disposal of resveratrol via the urine. The profound effects of ATP-binding cassette transporters on the disposal of resveratrol may be representative for the handling of several other polyphenols of dietary origin.

Animals - 20 healthy privately owned adult dogs. Procedures - In a randomized controlled clinical trial, dogs were fed a soy-based diet with high (HID; n = 10) or low (LID; 10) isoflavones content. General health of dogs, clinicopathologic variables, and serum concentrations of adrenal gland and thyroid gland hormones were assessed before treatment was initiated and up to 1 year later. Differences between groups with respect to changes in the values of variables after treatment were assessed by means of a Student t test (2 time points) and repeated-measures ANOVA (3 time points). Results - No differences were detected between the 2 groups with respect to body condition and results of hematologic, serum biochemical, and urine analyses. Most serum concentrations of hormones did not change significantly after treatment, nor were they affected by diet. However, the mean change in serum concentration of total thyroxine was higher in the HID group (15.7 pmol/L) than that in the LID group (-1.9 pmol/L). The mean change in estradiol concentration after ACTH stimulation at 1 year after diets began was also higher in the HID group (19.0 pg/mL) than that in the LID group (-5.6 pg/mL).

In view of such significance, the present study explored the pharmacophores of benzofuran derivatives containing pyridine, imidazole and triazole substituents for inhibiting selective aromatase enzyme, CYP19 activity. Implementing classical QSAR (R2=0.858, Q2=0.737, s=0.349, R 2test=0.839) and space modeling (R2=0.908, cost=179.138, rmsd=1.235, R2test=0.867) approaches, it has been explored that molecular hydrophobicity, presence of suitable ring substituent and hydrogen bond acceptors are the crucial key features of the benzofuran scaffold for imparting CYP19 inhibitory activity. Moreover steric properties of the molecule have influence on the activity. 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"advanced cancer article breast cancer drug structure *drug synthesis enzyme activity *enzyme inhibition hydrogen bond hydrophobicity molecular model *pharmacophore postmenopause priority journal quantitative structure activity relation stereochemistry 4 (1,2 diphenyl 1 butenyl)cinnamic acid/an [Drug Analysis] 4 (1,2 diphenyl 1 butenyl)cinnamic acid/pd [Pharmacology] 7' methoxyflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 7' methoxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] aminoglutethimide/an [Drug Analysis] aminoglutethimide/pd [Pharmacology] anastrozole/an [Drug Analysis] anastrozole/pd [Pharmacology] apigenin/an [Drug Analysis] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] *aromatase aromatase inhibitor/an [Drug Analysis] aromatase inhibitor/dv [Drug Development] aromatase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] asigenin/an [Drug Analysis] asigenin/pd [Pharmacology] *benzofuran derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *benzofuran derivative/dv [Drug Development] *benzofuran derivative/pd [Pharmacology] celecoxib/an [Drug Analysis] celecoxib/pd [Pharmacology] clidinium/an [Drug Analysis] clidinium/pd [Pharmacology] clomifene/an [Drug Analysis] clomifene/pd [Pharmacology] cyclofenil/an [Drug Analysis] cyclofenil/pd [Pharmacology] diethylstilbestrol/an [Drug Analysis] diethylstilbestrol/pd [Pharmacology] ephedrine/an [Drug Analysis] ephedrine/pd [Pharmacology] exemestane/an [Drug Analysis] exemestane/pd [Pharmacology] fadrozole/an [Drug Analysis] fadrozole/pd [Pharmacology] formestane/an [Drug Analysis] formestane/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] idoxifene/an [Drug Analysis] idoxifene/pd [Pharmacology] imidazole/an [Drug Analysis] imidazole/pd [Pharmacology] lasofoxifene/an [Drug Analysis] lasofoxifene/pd [Pharmacology] letrozole/an [Drug Analysis] letrozole/pd [Pharmacology] lutestin/an [Drug Analysis] lutestin/pd [Pharmacology] methadone/an [Drug Analysis] methadone/pd [Pharmacology] morphine/an [Drug Analysis] morphine/pd [Pharmacology] pyridine/an [Drug Analysis] pyridine/pd [Pharmacology] triazole derivative/an [Drug Analysis] triazole derivative/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug vorozole/an [Drug Analysis] vorozole/pd [Pharmacology]","38-45","6","2009",-1

However, epidemiologic studies on dietary flavonoids and cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results. Objective: We prospectively investigated the association between the intake of selected flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods and risk of cancers in the Women's Health Study. Design: A total of 3234 incident cancer cases were identified during 11.5 y of follow-up among 38,408 women aged >45 y. Intake of individual flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin) and flavones (apigenin and luteolin) was assessed from food-frequency questionnaires. Cox regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of total and site-specific cancer across increasing intakes of total and individual selected flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods (tea, apple, broccoli, onion, and tofu). Results: The multivariate RRs of total cancer across increasing quintiles of total quantified flavonoid intake were 1.00, 1.00, 0.93, 0.94, and 0.97 (P for trend - 0.72). For site-specific cancers, the multivariate RRs in the highest quintile of total quantified flavonoid intake compared with the lowest quintile were 1.03 for breast cancer, 1.01 for colorectal cancer, 1.03 for lung cancer, 1.15 for endometrial cancer, and 1.09 for ovarian cancer (all P > 0.05). The associations for the individual flavonoid intakes were similar to those for the total intake. There was also no significant association between intake of flavonoid-rich foods and the incidence of total and site-specific cancers.

A 52-year-old Caucasian post-menopausal woman presented with a slight enlargement of the right ovary and uterine fibromyomatosis. She was taking HRT for 4 years in a cyclic combined regimen of 2 mg oestradiol with 1 mg cyproterone acetate. The serum tumour markers occasionally measured were in normal range except CA 19.9 (997 U/mL; normal values 0.0-37) and CA 125 (85 U/mL; normal values 0.0-35). However, on one occasion, the CA 19.9 and CA 125 were high and then showed persistently high values (1005 and 81.3 U/mL, respectively). Radiodiagnostic investigations excluded any malignancies and a hysteroscopy showed endometrial thickening. After discontinuation of HRT, CA 125 levels returned to normal after 1 month, whereas CA 19.9 took 6 months to do so. Four months after the beginning subsequent therapy with over-the-counter phyto-oestrogens a new serum test showed an increase in CA 19.9 but CA 125 remained within the normal range. Phyto-oestrogen therapy was then interrupted and 1 month later CA 19.9 returned to normal. In this case, cyclic HRT was the probable cause of CA 19.9 and CA 125 increase. Positive dechallenge and subsequent CA 19.9 increase after phyto-oestrogen intake seem to confirm the role of oestrogens as the cause of the endometrial thickening through hormonal imbalance. Increased CA 19.9 and CA 125 levels in benign gynaecological conditions may be a source of misdiagnosis of malignant disease. 2008 The Authors.",NA,"adult article case report diagnostic error endocrine disease estrogen activity *estrogen therapy female hormone substitution human postmenopause radiodiagnosis side effect/si [Side Effect] uterus myoma *CA 125 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *CA 19-9 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyproterone acetate/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] cyproterone acetate/cb [Drug Combination] daidzein estradiol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estradiol/cb [Drug Combination] estrogen genistein glycitein phytoestrogen","129-132","34","2009",-1

We conducted a hospital-based case-control study during June 2007 to August 2008 among Guangdong Chinese women to investigate associations between meat and egg intake and breast cancer risk. Methods: Four hundred and thirty-eight consecutively recruited cases with primary breast cancer were frequency matched to 438 controls by age (5-year interval) and residence (rural/urban). Dietary intake was assessed by face-to-face interviews using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained by using multiple unconditional logistic regression adjusted for various dietary and nondietary confounders. Results: We observed a borderline increased association of processed meat intake with breast cancer risk (trend test p = 0.066). The multivariate-adjusted OR of breast cancer risk for the highest versus the lowest quartile was 1.44 (95% CI = 0.97-2.15). No significant association was found between total and red meat, poultry, fish, and egg intake and risk.

However, age-related changes in this communication axis have been scarcely studied. In mammals, the process of ageing is associated with an important decline in the secretion of several hormones, such as growth hormone (GH), melatonin (MEL) and oestrogens (Os). Ovariectomy, a model of menopause in rats, has been found to lead to premature immunosenescence. In the present study, the effect of ovariectomy and the role of replacement therapies with GH, MEL, O and natural phyto-oestrogens (POs) have been assessed on several functions in leucocytes from the spleen and the axillary nodes of intact and ovariectomised rats. Chemotaxis, lymphoproliferative response to the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), the release of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the natural killer (NK) cell activity have been investigated. Age-controlled rats were used to compare immune functions in hormone treated aged rats with those in younger untreated animals. In all experimental groups, the immune impairment caused by ageing and ovariectomy was partially or completely reversed by hormone treatments. Since the immune system is a marker of health and a predictor of longevity, the results suggest that treatment with hormones could slow down the effects of the ageing process. 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Cui","Isoflavone reduces body weight by decreasing food intake in ovariectomized rats","Background/Aims: The primary objective of this study was to further determine the mechanisms by which isoflavone prevents obesity induced by ovariectomy. Methods: Female 8-week-old Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 6 groups: a sham-operated group; an ovariectomized (OVX) control group; 3 OVX groups orally administered 400 ppm (L-SI), 1,200 ppm (M-SI) and 3,600 ppm (H-SI) of an isoflavone preparation, respectively, and an OVX group receiving 0.45 ppm of diethylstilbestrol. All animals were allowed free access to a high-fat diet and water for 4 weeks. Some neuropeptides, including ghrelin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY), insulin and estradiol (E2), were measured by radioimmunoassay. Results: Compared with the OVX control group, body weight, total abdominal fat, food intake and food availability of the M-SI and H-SI groups were significantly reduced. The results also showed that isoflavone and diethylstilbestrol could decrease ghrelin and NPY levels and increase CCK, PYY and E2 levels. The level of alpha-MSH was not changed. Conclusions: These findings showed that isoflavone could reduce obesity by decreasing food intake, possibly by (1) reducing ghrelin and NPY levels, thereby decreasing food intake, and (2) increasing CCK and PYY levels, which can induce satiety by irritating the vagal center.

To assess the toxicity of a novel DGLA oil produced by the fungus Mortierella alpina, we examined it in the Ames test and in acute and subchronic oral toxicity tests in rats. In the Ames test, no mutagenicity was found up to 5000 mug/plate. The acute toxicity test revealed no toxicity related to DGLA oil at 10 g/kg. In the subchronic toxicity test, DGLA oil (500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) was orally administered. Water and soybean oil (2000 mg/kg) were used for the no-oil control and soybean oil control groups, respectively. There was no death in either sex. Because of administration of large amounts of oil, food consumption was low in the soybean oil control and the three test groups, which appeared to mildly decrease urinary excretion of Na, K, and Cl, as well as total serum protein, albumin, and blood urea nitrogen levels. There were no toxicological changes in body weight, food consumption, ophthalmological examination, urinalysis, hematological examination, blood biochemical examination, necropsy, organ weight, or histopathological examination.

Methods: BCRP expression was verified by immunostaining and Western blots in intact porcine brain capillaries, isolated endothelial cells (PBCECs) and in MDCKII-cells over-expressing human wild-type BCRP (MDCKII-hBCRP). Transport of fluorescent mitoxantrone across cells was determined to assess a preferred transport direction. Sensitivity of cultured cells versus mitoxantrone in the absence and in the presence of transport modulators was examined at increasing concentrations of the cytostatic using the AlamarBlue assay. In addition, cells were incubated with mitoxantrone in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of different compounds with the potential to interact with BCRP. Intracellular fluorescence accumulation was measured using a flow cytometer. Results: Isolated capillaries as well as 7-day old PBCECs showed expression of BCRP. Cell sensitivity to mitoxantrone significantly increased in the presence of the BCRP inhibitors KO143 and GF120918. Transport of mitoxantrone across PBCEC monolayers was directed with Papp (apical to basolateral) 5.6 x 10-6 cm s-1 and with Papp (basolateral to apical) 2.8 x 10-5 cm s-1. FACS analysis revealed a different extent of fluorescence accumulation dependent on the kind and concentration of BCRP modulating compounds. Conclusions: The mitoxantrone-based assay can be used as a rapid FACS screening system to assess drug interactions with BCRP at the blood-brain barrier and therefore represents a useful tool in drug profiling. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A case-control study was conducted in southeast China in 2004-2005 to examine the association between dietary isoflavone intake and breast cancer risk by estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. The incident cases were 756 female patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer. The 1,009 age-matched controls were healthy women randomly recruited from outpatient breast clinics. We assessed isoflavone intake by face-to-face interview using a validated and reliable food-frequency questionnaire and obtained tumor ER and PR status from pathologic reports. Compared with women in the lowest intake quartiles, those in the highest quartile of total isoflavone intake had a reduced risk of all receptor status subtypes of breast cancer with a dose-response relationship. The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) were 0.39 (0.27-0.58) for ER+, 0.32 (0.21-0.49) for ER-, 0.43 (0.29-0.64) for PR+, and 0.30 (0.19-0.45) for PR- (P for trend <0.001). These inverse associations existed in both pre- and post-menopausal women after stratification. Stronger evidence of a protective effect of high isoflavone intake was observed for breast cancer tumors with concordant rather than discordant receptor status; i.e., those with ER+/PR+ (OR 0.39, 0.26-0.59) and ER-/PR- (OR 0.28, 0.17-0.44). The finding that isoflavones protect against all tumor subtypes of breast cancer have biological plausibility, being supported by evidence from experimental studies.

Although the effects of soy are not well understood, some breast cancer survivors increase their soy intake post-diagnosis in attempt to improve their prognosis. Therefore, we examined the role of soy isoflavone intake and the risk of breast cancer recurrence by hormone receptor status, menopausal status, and tamoxifen therapy. A cohort of 1,954 female breast cancer survivors, diagnosed during 1997-2000, was prospectively followed for 6.31 years and 282 breast cancer recurrences were ascertained. Isoflavone intake was assessed by mailing modified Block and supplemental soy food frequency questionnaires to participants, on average 23 months post-diagnosis. Risk of breast cancer recurrence, measured by hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), was estimated using multivariable delayed entry Cox proportional hazards models. Suggestive trends for a reduced risk of cancer recurrence were observed with increasing quintiles of daidzein and glycetin intake compared to no intake among postmenopausal women (P for trend: P = 0.08 for daidzein, P = 0.06 for glycetin) and among tamoxifen users (P = 0.10 for daidzein, P = 0.05 for glycetin). Among postmenopausal women treated with tamoxifen, there was an approximately 60% reduction in breast cancer recurrence comparing the highest to the lowest daidzein intakes (>1,453 vs. <7.7 mug/day; HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.21-0.79, P = 0.008). Soy isoflavones consumed at levels comparable to those in Asian populations may reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in women receiving tamoxifen therapy and moreover, appears not to interfere with tamoxifen efficacy. Further confirmation is required in other large prospective studies before recommendations regarding soy intake can be issued to breast cancer survivors. 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"adult aged article Asian *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer epidemiology *cancer recurrence/pc [Prevention] cancer risk *cancer survivor cancer therapy cohort analysis confidence interval controlled study female food intake hazard ratio human menopause postmenopause priority journal prognosis prospective study quality of life questionnaire *soybean daidzein estrogen hormone receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone derivative tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy]","395-405","118","2009",1

For this reason, the research for possible therapeutic strategies involving the modulation of the apoptotic pathways has attracted considerable interest in the past few years. In particular, it has been shown that apoptosis may be induced or inhibited by a variety of nutritional compounds providing health benefits. The aim of this review is to examine the ability of different dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to induce apoptosis, especially in the cancer field. The molecular effects of different PUFAs found in dairy products, meat, fish, vegetable seeds and oils, and known to affect the incidence and progression of cancer and other chronic diseases, will be analyzed. To this aim, our effort will concentrate in critically reviewing the published works concerning the effects of: (a) the n-6 PUFAs -linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, and conjugated linoleic acid; (b) the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid on the apoptotic process.

We conducted hospital-based case-control studies of patients aged 20-74 years with primary, incident, histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer, and matched controls from medical checkup examinees in Nagano, Japan and from cancer-free patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 850 pairs (390 Japanese, 81 Japanese Brazilians and 379 non-Japanese Brazilians) completed validated food frequency questionnaires. The odds ratio of breast cancer according to isoflavone intake was estimated using a conditional logistic regression model. We found a statistically significant inverse association between isoflavone intake and the risk of breast cancer for Japanese Brazilians and non-Japanese Brazilians. For Japanese, a non-significant inverse association was limited to postmenopausal women. In the three populations combined, breast cancer risk linearly decreased from 'no' to 'moderate' isoflavone intake and thereafter leveled off. Compared to non-consumers, adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for consumers in increasing quintile intake categories (median intake in each category: 8.7, 23.1, 33.8, 45.7, and 71.3 mg/day) were 0.69 (0.44-1.09), 0.54 (0.31-0.94), 0.45 (0.26-0.77), 0.34 (0.19-0.62), and 0.43 (0.24-0.76), respectively. Overall, we found an inverse association between dietary isoflavone intake and risk of breast cancer. Our finding suggests a risk-reducing rather than risk-enhancing effect of isoflavones on breast cancer within the range achievable from dietary intake alone. In addition, women may benefit from risk reduction if they consume at least moderate amounts of isoflavones. 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"adult aged article Brazil *breast cancer cancer invasion cancer risk case control study controlled study *dietary intake female food frequency questionnaire human Japanese major clinical study medical examination postmenopause priority journal estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone progesterone receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","401-411","116","2009",1

Tsai","Puerariae radix isoflavones and their metabolites inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells","Puerariae radix (PR) is a popular natural herb and a traditional food in Asia, which has antithrombotic and anti-allergic properties and stimulates estrogenic activity. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the PR isoflavones puerarin, daidzein, and genistein on the growth of breast cancer cells. Our data revealed that after treatment with PR isoflavones, a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth occurred in HS578T, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cell lines. Results from cell cycle distribution and apoptosis assays revealed that PR isoflavones induced cell apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent pathway and mediated cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Furthermore, we observed that the serum metabolites of PR (daidzein sulfates/glucuronides) inhibited proliferation of the breast cancer cells at a 50% cell growth inhibition (GI50) concentration of 2.35 muM. These results indicate that the daidzein constituent of PR can be metabolized to daidzein sulfates or daidzein glucuronides that exhibit anticancer activities. The protein expression levels of the active forms of caspase-9 and Bax in breast cancer cells were significantly increased by treatment with PR metabolites. These metabolites also increased the protein expression levels of p53 and p21. We therefore suggest that PR may act as a chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agent against breast cancer by reducing cell viability and inducing apoptosis. 2008.",NA,"antineoplastic activity *apoptosis article *breast cancer *cancer cell *cancer inhibition cell cycle arrest cell cycle G2 phase cell cycle M phase cell proliferation cell strain MCF 7 cell viability concentration response controlled study drug effect female human human cell *medicinal plant priority journal protein expression *puerariae radix caspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] *daidzein/an [Drug Analysis] *daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/an [Drug Analysis] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glucuronide protein Bax/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein p21/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein p53/ec [Endogenous Compound] *puerarin/an [Drug Analysis] *puerarin/pd [Pharmacology]","683-688","378","2009",-1
"1359","1281"," D. Spyropoulos","Contrasting mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis and metastasis using mouse genetic models","With the onset of puberty, mammary epithelial branching morphogenesis is transformed from simple allometric growth to a highly proliferative and highly expansive process involving extensive extracellular matrix remodeling and stromal invasion. It is therefore not surprising that similarities are often drawn between branching morphogenesis and the metastatic spread of breast cancer cells. One key difference is that branching morphogenesis normally remains limited to the architectural boundaries set in the fat pad. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences hold promise for therapies, which limit breast cancer metastases. Genetically and hormonally manipulated in vivo mouse models (HoxC gene targeted disruptions, mammary epithelial-specific inducible HoxC genes, MMTV-rtTA TRE-HoxC-IRES-EGFP, and constitutive breast cancer models, MMTV-cNeu) and in vitro human breast cancer cell lines (MCF10A, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) were used to assess impacts on mammary epithelial growth, differentiation and expression of HoxC and direct target genes. Cell lines were manipulated using HoxC6 shRNA and cDNA lentivirus and activated Akt isoform retroviral expression vectors. Gene expression and signaling were measured by quantitative RT-qPCR, IHC, Western blot and the BioPlex200 Multiplex System. HoxC5 & C6 are expressed in mammary epithelium and stroma and therein differentially repressed by ovarian hormones. This repression can be modulated in vivo by phytoestrogen exposure. Thoracic mammary glands fail to develop postnatally in corresponding knockout mice. Embryonic and neonatal induction of epithelial-specific HoxC6 expression in transgenic mice leads to precocious terminal end bud formation, suggesting distinct cell-autonomous and non-autonomous functions. Epithelial-stromal reconstitution experiments (surgical and genetic) show that epithelial-specific, activated Her2/Neu expression is sufficient to rescue ductal elongation defects in the knockout, but that stromal Hox gene expression is required for ductal side-branching. In contrast, Her2/Neu-derived mammary tumor metastasis is accelerated in Hox-defective mammary glands. These results will be discussed in the context of changes in epithelial and stromal compartments (cellular phenotypes and genetic signatures). Molecular models will be presented to account for the results presented, especially as they pertain to therapeutic modalities.",NA,"*branching morphogenesis *metastasis *mouse *biological model *society breast cancer gene gene expression mammary gland expression vector Western blotting breast epithelium stroma exposure mouse mutant knockout mouse transgenic mouse budding Hox gene breast tumor phenotype chemical structure puberty extracellular matrix cancer cell model cancer model in vitro study human cancer cell culture cell line Lentivirinae therapy hormone phytoestrogen short hairpin RNA complementary DNA","297","61","2009",-1

Soy intake is inversely correlated with prostate cancer risk and soy constituents inhibit prostate cancer cell growth and prostate carcinogenesis in rodents. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a standardized soy supplement tests the hypothesis that soy protein consumption reduces the biochemical recurrence rate in men who are at increased risk for PSA failure in the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Eligibility criteria are: Gleason sum of >8, established extra-capsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, established positive margins, positive lymph nodes, and/or a preoperative PSA of >20 ng/ml. PSA failure was defined a priori as a value of >0.07 ng/ml (Tosoh) when confirmed twice at >1 month intervals. Data from literature and NYU at the start of the study indicated an estimated 30% two-year PSA failure rate in eligible men. The sample size is 256 evaluable men, providing 80% power to detect a 50% reduction in PSA failure rate at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. Because the drop-out rate is approx. 13%, the accrual goal is 284. Subjects are randomized to 2 years of soy protein isolate or casein-based placebo identical in composition, except for the source of protein (20 g/day), the soy containing 24-26 mg/day genistein and 40-43 mg total isoflavones; the placebo is devoid of soy-specific constituents. Compliance is self-reported and estimated from serum isoflavones levels (including equol). RESULTS: Besides UIC and NYU, 3 other academic and 2 VA medical centers are currently involved in this study. Thus far, 178 men have been randomized and 155 have completed intervention; except a few transient episodes of constipation, there were no treatment-related adverse events and self-reported compliance was excellent. There were no effects on CBC and thyroid hormone levels. All 34 men thus far identified with confirmed PSA failure developed further evidence of recurrence; 4 additional men reached a PSA of 0.07 ng/ml. 31 % of blood samples with high genistein levels (soy consumers) were from men not producing equol, 28% from equol producers (> 10 ng/ml), and 41% from marginal equol producers (1-10 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of 20 g/day of soy protein isolate for 2 years is safe, while drop-out is low. The 0.07 ng/ml PSA cut-off for failure is fully predictive of clinical recurrence.

Juang","Luteolin affects cell prolifertation, cell invasion and prostate-specific antigen expression by dyregulation of prostate-derived Ets factor and androgen receptor expression in prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Luteolin is a polyphenolic flavone found in many plants including soybeans and perilla leaves. The prostate-derived Ets factor (PDEF), a novel prostate epithelium-specific Ets transcription factor, acts as an androgen-independent transcriptional activator of the prostate specific antigen (PSA) promoter. We determined the anti-tumor function of luteolin via upregulation of PDEF gene expression in prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. METHODS: Quantitative androgen receptor (AR) and PDEF expressions in prostate carcinoma cells were assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblot assay. Stably-overexpression of PDEF by LNCaP cells was achieved by transfecting the human PDEF overexpression vector into LNCaP cells using electroporation. Expression of PSA was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot, and transient gene expression assays. Proliferation and invasion ability of cells were determined by the in vitro 3H-thymidine incorporation assay and matrigel invasion assay. RESULTS: Luteolin treatments (0.3 to 30 muM) attenuated the cell proliferation and PSA expression in LNCaP cells. Immunoblot blot assay revealed that luteolin treatments upregulated PDEF but downregulated AR gene expression. Results from RT-PCR, immunoblot assay, and transient gene expression assay revealed that luteolin treatments enhanced gene expression of PDEF, B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2), N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), and Maspin in the LNCaP cells. Transient gene expression assays indicated that forced-overexpression of PDEF induced the promoter activities of BTG2, NDRG1, and Maspin genes. Stably-overexpression of PDEF significantly induced the gene expression of BTG2, NDRG1 and Maspin, which dramatically attenuated in vitro cell proliferation and invasion in the LNCaP cells CONCLUSIONS: These results prove that luteolin blocks PSA gene expression by downregulation of AR expression. The present study indicates that BTG2, NDRG1, and Maspin are the PDEF-regulated genes. The enhancement of PDEF gene expression may account for the function of luteolin for anti-proliferation and anti-invasion in the LNCaP cells.",NA,"*cell strain LNCaP *prostate carcinoma *prostate *antigen expression *cell invasion assay gene expression immunoblotting transient expression gene in vitro study promoter region cell proliferation B lymphocyte gene translocation reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction plant soybean Perilla plant leaf prostate epithelium tumor upregulation carcinoma cell human electroporation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay DNA synthesis oncogene c myb *luteolin *androgen receptor *prostate specific antigen maspin factor A flavone transcription factor androgen matrigel","396","181","2009",-1

Simmen","Regulation of adipocyte lipid homeostasis by genistein alters mammary epithelial cell differentiation: A paracrine mechanism for mammary tumor protection","Epidemiological and animal studies have shown a negative correlation between breast cancer incidence and intake of soy-rich foods. Our laboratory has used soy protein isolate (SPI), the primary component of soy infant formula, as a paradigm to evaluate diet as a risk factor in mammary cancer. We previously demonstrated that lifetime exposure to dietary SPI reduced the incidence of NMU-induced mammary tumors in young adult rats relative to those fed the control Casein diet (CAS). This protection was associated with increased differentiation status of mammary epithelial cells prior to carcinogen insult, suggesting enhanced differentiation as a mechanism for mammary tumor protection. To identify early events contributing to diet-induced mammary differentiation, we used Affymetrix RAE230A GeneChips containing 14280 probes and GeneSpring Gx to analyze genomic profiles of mammary glands of prepubertal [postnatal day (PND) 21] rats which were lifetime exposed to dietary SPI or CAS. Of the 8 genes down-regulated by SPI, 4 are involved in lipid homeostasis: malic enzyme 1, fatty acid synthase (Fasn), stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1), and insulin-induced gene 1. One of five SPI-induced genes is 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (Hsd1), which converts 11beta-dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that Fasn and Scd1 transcript levels were down-regulated and Hsd1 was up-regulated, in PND21 mammary tissues of SPI vs CAS group. We evaluated potential paracrine effects of soy-mediated alterations in adipocyte lipid metabolism on mammary epithelial cell phenotype. In these studies, we used the mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cell line treated with the bioactive soy isoflavone genistein (GEN) and mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 as in vitro systems to recapitulate in vivo stromal/epithelial interactions. GEN (0.5 muM) regulated lipid homeostasis in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. GEN decreased Fasn and Scd1 and increased Hsd1 transcript levels in the absence of effects on leptin and PPAR2 gene expression. To evaluate whether factors produced by GEN-treated adipocytes regulate mammary epithelial differentiation, mature adipocytes were incubated in medium with or without GEN (0.5 muM) for 48 h. Cells were refreshed with maintenance medium without GEN and 24 h later, conditioned medium (CM) was harvested, supplemented with prolactin (5 ng/ml), and added full-strength to HC11 cells. Cells incubated for 72 h in CM from GEN-exposed adipocytes had higher differentiation-associated beta-casein transcript levels than those grown in non-GEN-treated CM. Our data support the hypothesis that GEN modulation of mammary fat pad metabolism and secretion constitutes one mechanism by which mammary epithelial differentiation is enhanced by diet to confer increased resistance to breast cancer. Studies are in progress to identify adipocyte-secreted factors regulated by this dietary isoflavone.

Simmen","Tumor suppressor PTEN signaling is up-regulated in mammary epithelial cells by soy isoflavone genistein: Implications for breast cancer protection","Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in the Western hemisphere affecting one of eight women in their lifetime. In addition to chromosomal and genetic alterations, nutrition is considered a risk determinant for breast cancer. Prevailing evidence suggests a negative correlation between intake of soy-rich foods and breast cancer incidence. Epidemiological and case control studies have shown a two-to eight fold lower occurrence of the disease in Asian women whose early intake of soy products is 20-25 times higher than their American counterparts. Previous work from our group has shown diet-induced protection against DMBA-and NMU-induced mammary tumors in vivo, with decreased tumor incidence and increased tumor latency in rats exposed to dietary soy protein isolate (SPI) or casein (CAS) supplemented with the major soy isoflavone genistein (GEN) when compared to those fed the control casein (CAS) diet. We also have shown that GEN enhanced apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro (MCF-7 cells), attendant with increased expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN and several pro-apoptotic genes Bax, Bok, and p21. Here, we test the hypothesis that GEN induction of PTEN expression and nuclear localization in mammary epithelial cells result in decreased cellular proliferation and enhanced cellular differentiation, to confer protection from mammary tumorigenesis. Using the non-tumor human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A, we show that GEN at physiologically relevant concentrations (40 nM, 2 muM) increased PTEN mRNA and protein levels and enhanced nuclear accumulation of active (non-phosphorylated) PTEN. GEN induction of PTEN transcript levels was lost with the inclusion of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, suggesting PTEN is a direct GEN target. Further, cells treated with GEN for 6 days had lower cell viability when compared to control cells, concomitant with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and of the PTEN regulated gene pleiotrophin. Interestingly, GEN up-regulation of PTEN expression was accompanied by similar effects on another tumor suppressor p53, which co-localized with PTEN in the nuclei of GEN-treated cells. PTEN siRNA targeting, which decreased basal PTEN expression by 60%, significantly increased cyclin D1 but not p53 expression. Our findings provide support to the hypothesis that the protective effects of GEN in the mammary epithelium may be mediated by PTEN to enhance differentiation and inhibit cellular proliferation, and suggest the participation of another key tumor suppressor p53.

Its etiology is obscure while there is evidence that food allergy (non IgE mediated) may play an important role. We used APT to evaluate the presence of food allergy in children with chronic constipation. METHODS: We evaluated 82 children aged 6monts to 11years (median age 26 months) with chronic constipation, without anatomic abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and celiac diseases. Skin prick test (SPT) was performed to all patients for the detection of specific IgE to some food allergens: milk, whole egg, wheat, corn, potato, chicken, beef, soy (we used fresh food allergen, prick to prick). NaCl 0.9% & histamine: 10 mg/ml were used as negative and positive control respectively. Subsequently, atopy patch tests were placed on the patients' back, with the same fresh food. Finally, blood samples were withdrawn for the detection of serum specific IgE for the same allergens with the CAP-FEIA (Pharmacia). RESULTS: Seventy eight children (78/82, 95%) had (+ve) APT. Of these, fifteen (15/78 19%) had also (ve+) CAP and 3/78 (4%) had also (+ve) SPT. Thirteen children (13/78, 17%) had (+) APT to one food allergen and 65/78 (83%) had (+) APT to >1 food allergens. The avoidance of food allergens with positive APT had as result the improvement of constipation.

The initial ""health claim"" towards menopausal applications of ISO containing products stems from epidemiologic observations as soy isoflavones seem to reduce the prevalence of hormonedependent cancers, e.g. endometrial, breast or prostate cancer. These claims were further supported by the observation, that neonatal exposure to ISO can prevent DMBA induced mammary cancer in rats. Although there are numerous studies on ISO phytoestrogens, experimental animal data on their long-term effects eventually supporting or disapproving observations in epidemiological studies are scarce. Therefore we and others [1] performed dietary exposure studies in rats with ISO-free diets or diets specifically enrichted in ISO or pure genistein. Differently to others we started the exposure already prior to mating of the parental animals and it was maintained throughout the life of the offspring up to day 97. The dietary exposure to ISO improved bone strength, did not stimulate proliferative activities within the mammary gland, but dramatically affected estrogen responsiveness in the uterus. The first two observations clearly represent beneficial properties of lifelong dietary exposure to ISO. How the finding on induction of increased estrogen responsiveness by ISO has to be interpreted within in the frame of risk/benefit debate of ISO is subject of further studies. In summary, chronic dietary exposure with soy ISO may have beneficial impact on mammary gland and bone health and clearly is different to results from acute therapeutic application studies to treat already existing symptoms. A possible link of these findings to modifications of the epigenome will be discussed and is also subject of further studies. In conclusion, these findings are of particular relevance consumers of Oriental diets or those supplementing their diet with ISOs and as a consequence potentially undergo a significant health impact.",NA,"*medicinal plant *society *long term exposure exposure diet health rat mammary gland hormone substitution prevalence neoplasm breast prostate cancer breast cancer experimental animal mating progeny bone strength uterus bone consumer food Asian *natural product *phytoestrogen estrogen isoflavone derivative genistein dimethylbenz[a]anthracene",NA,"75","2009",-1

We tested the effect of red wine versus white wine on serum hormone levels in healthy, premenopausal women. Design: 36 premenopausal women without chronic medical conditions and not using exogenous hormone therapy were asked to participate. Participants were first screened for alcohol abuse and then randomly assigned in a crossover study design to red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon, BV Costal 2003) first (Treatment 1) and white wine (Chardonnay BV Coastal 2003) second (Treatment 2), or the reverse. Participants were asked to consume 8 ounces of the assigned wine in the evening with food, agreed not to drive afterwards and abstain from other alcoholic beverages and grape products. The duration of each treatment was a one month menstrual cycle. During a run-in cycle the participants abstained from all alcoholic and grape products during an initial menstrual cycle. Serum was collected at early follicular (day 5- 8) and mid-luteal (day 17-21) phases during run-in, Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 cycles for measurement of estrone, estradiol, androstenedione, total testostosterone and SHBG. Free testosterone and free estradiol were calculated. A wash-out period between the two treatments occurred after the mid-luteal serum collection and day 0 of the next menstrual cycle during which women abstained from all alcohol and grape products. Absolute differences between treatments were assessed in a mixed effect model under random subject effect. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 36+8 years, mean body mass index was 26+5, and 57% were non-white. At entry, 35% had never consumed soy products, 80% were employed full-time, and 69% had a history of smoking. During the red wine treatment, combined early follicular and mid-luteal data demonstrated a statistically significant higher free testosterone (p=0.009), compared to white wine treatment, and a lower SHBG level was also observed (p=0.007); no difference was observed in estradiol levels (Table). After excluding outlier values (defined as above the normal range), a trend towards lower estradiol levels was observed in the early follicular phase with the red wine vs white wine. (68.2 vs. 93.2 pg/ml, mean difference -24.8 + 10.9, p=0.056). Conclusion: Red wine but not white wine consumption is associated with an increase in free testosterone, lower SHBG, and a trend towards lower estradiol levels in healthy premenopausal women. Lack of a trend towards lower estradiol levels may not have been observed in the mid-luteal phase due to the relatively high endogenous ovarian estrogen production at that time overcoming the aromatization of testosterone. These results suggest that red wine may serve as a naturally occurring aromatase inhibitor.

Dabrosin","Tamoxifen and the lignan enterolactone increase in vivo levels of IL-1Ra and decrease tumor angiogenesis in estrogen dependent breast cancer explants","Phytoestrogens have been shown to be potential compounds in breast cancer prevention and treatment by poorly understood mechanisms. One of the most abundant phytoestrogen in Western diet is the mammalian lignan enterolactone (ENL). We have previously reported a pro-angiogenic action of estradiol counteracted by the anti-estrogen tamoxifen in breast cancer. The proinflammatory cytokines IL-1alpha and IL-1beta have been shown to be major pro-angiogenic whereas the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) seems to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Here we show that estradiol decreased secreted IL-Ra of breast cancer cell in vitro and that the addition of tamoxifen or ENL to the cells reversed this decrease. Moreover, tamoxifen exposure alone increased IL-1Ra levels significantly compared to control cells. Mice bearing estrogen dependent breast cancers were treated with subcutaneous injections of tamoxifen, fed with ENL, or continued exposure of estradiol only. In these solid breast cancer tumors extracellular IL-1Ra was sampled in situ using microdialysis after 2-3 weeks of treatment. Tumors of mice treated with tamoxifen or fed with ENL had significantly increased extracellular IL-Ra levels compared with control tumors exposed to estradiol only in a similar fashion as shown in vitro and these tumors also exhibited decreased vessel area. Moreover, treatment with subcutaneous injections of recombinant IL-Ra protein resulted in tumor regression in vivo despite continued estradiol exposure. We conclude that estradiol down-regulate IL-1Ra in breast cancer cells. In addition, we show that an anti-estrogenic effect of ENL in breast cancer include restoration of IL-1Ra levels and that one of the anti-tumorigenic effects of tamoxifen may be mediated via potent increase of IL-1Ra levels in estrogen dependent breast cancer. Taken together our results suggest that increasing IL-1Ra may be a possible anti-estrogen therapeutic option for breast cancer treatment and prevention.",NA,"*breast cancer *tumor *prevention *explant *angiogenesis *therapy *tumor microenvironment exposure cancer cell in vitro study mouse subcutaneous drug administration mammal carcinogenesis cancer therapy solid microdialysis diet cancer prevention tumor regression *interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent *tamoxifen *estrogen *enterolactone *lignan estradiol phytoestrogen interleukin 1beta interleukin 1alpha antiestrogen interleukin 1 receptor protein cytokine","S87","2","2009",-1

In the present study, a series of hydroxystilbenes which are resveratrol analogues were synthesized and radiolabeled with 125I. Their efficacy of binding with MCF-7 cell lines were evaluated in preliminary cell binding studies. Methods: The hydroxystilbenes were synthesized via the McMurry Reaction involving the reductive coupling of aryl aldehydes with Zn and TiCl4, yielding the (E)-stilbenes exclusively as shown in the figure. [IMG] The stilbenes (~0.1 mM) were radioiodinated with 125I (~ 300 mCi) (molar ratios 500:1), at pH 7.5. The reaction was carried out for 60 seconds at room temperature. Iodogen (50 mg, in coated tubes) was used as an oxidizing agent. Radioiodination yield was determined using paper electrophoresis (0.025 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 250 V, 60 minutes). The reaction mixture was then purified using a pre-conditioned C18 cartridge. The purified product was characterized by Jasco PU 1580HPLC system with a C-18 reversed phase HiQ Sil (5muM, 250x4 mm) column. Elution was monitored using both UV signals (270nm) as well as by following the radioactivity profile. Water (A) and acetonitrile (B), both containing 0.1% TFA were used as solvents at flow rate of 1 mL/min with a gradient of 0-4 min 10% B, 4-20 min 10-98% B and 20-30 min 98-100% B. Stability of the product for a period of 24 h at room temperature and 8 days at 4degreeC was also determined by using HPLC. In vitro cell uptake studies were carried out in MCF-7 cells. In vivo distribution studies were carried out in normal female Swiss mice in order to study its pharmacokinetics pattern and the uterine uptake was determined at 3 h and 24 h p.i. [Figure presented] Results: One derivative of the series of hydroxystilbenes synthesized provided the radioiodinated product in good yield of >90%. Radiochemical purity of Sep-Pak purified product on HPLC analysis was found to be ~90%. This analogue was taken up for cell binding and in-vivo distribution studies. A comparison of the HPLC retention time of the radioiodinated stilbene with that of the cold iodinated stilbene, which was synthesized independently by McMurry reaction, for the purpose of comparison, were found to be identical. The pure fraction stored in phosphate buffer saline exhibited good stability after 24 h at room temperature, as determined by HPLC. In biodistribution studies, uptake in uterus was found to be 0.85% ID/g at 3h p.i. with uterus/muscle ratio of 2.5. In vivo stability was indicated by negligible uptake in the thyroid. In vitro cell uptake was ~30%. Conclusions: The stilbene derivative could be synthesized and radiolabeled with 125I in >90% radiochemical yield. Preliminary in vitro binding studies with MCF-7 cells as well as biodistribution studies in female Swiss mice shows favorable features and warrants further investigation.

Anton","Stimuli modulation of apoptosis and proliferation through cell cycle phases in colon cancer cell lines","Apoptosis represents a cellular ""suicide"" mechanism which allows the control of cell number from tissues and elimination of cells that present DNA mutations or having an abberant cell cycle, those cells being predisposed to malignant transformation. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms of programmed cell death process seems to be of great importance for malignant transformation, tumour evasion and therefore for anti-cancer therapy. Many anti-cancer drugs act during physiological pathways of apoptosis, leading to tumour cell destruction. The present study focused on the potential influence of oncolitical treatment (5-fluorouracyl) associated with natural compounds (curcumin, genistein, quercitin) on the dynamics of the cell cycle and levels of apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines (e.g. COLO 201, SW1116, LoVo, Caco-2, HT-29). In addition, expression of antigens involved in tumour proliferation and apoptosis (Ki-67, PCNA, P53, Bcl-2) was compared with gene expression in the presence or absence of stimuli treatment. Percentages of apoptotic cells were detected by using annexin V/FITC and propidium iodide double staining, while progression through cell cycle phases was evaluated by using PI staining. Correlation analyses between the individual profile of the stimulimodulated gene expression with the coded protein expression were performed by using data from RT-PCR with specific primers, and indirect immunofluorescence followed by flow cytometry, respectively. Stimuli treatment of colon cancer cell lines differentially induced higher levels of apoptosis as compared to untreated tumour cells, while cell cycle distribution of DNA changed. Data obtained showed a various expression and functional behaviour of the markers under study associated to colon cancer cells, suggesting their possible involvement in regulating the interactions between tumour cells and host immune system. The results obtained might further lead to the establishment of an experimental pattern for the corroboration of cell and molecular mechanisms involved in the tumour progression and the treatment resistance of colon tumors using cell lines. The effect of modulatoy agents on proliferation and apoptosis could be used in clinical departments in order to elaborate new therapeutical approaches and act as useful instruments in elaboration of individualized treatment schemes.",NA,"*apoptosis *colon cancer *stimulus *cell cycle phase *cancer cell culture *immunology *modulation cell cycle malignant transformation tumor growth tumor cell gene expression staining cancer therapy tumor cell destruction dynamics correlation analysis protein expression immunofluorescence flow cytometry cancer cell immune system colon tumor cell line suicide cell count tissue mutation tumor DNA antineoplastic agent natural product curcumin genistein quercetin antigen protein p53 annexin marker propidium iodide","S197","39","2009",-1

The effect of soy phytoestrogen in the metabolic syndrome (MeS) associated with subclinical hypothyroidism has not been studied. Methods: A randomised, double-blind, cross over study was undertaken involving 60 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients were randomly assigned to either low dose phytoestrogen (30 g of soy protein12mg phytoestrogens) or high dose phytoestrogen (30 g of soy protein116 mg phytoestrogens) supplement for 8 weeks and then crossed over after an 8 week wash out period. MeS was defined as per the ATP III criteria.

Consequently, the role of phytoestrogens was assessed by using the most reliable scientific evidence. The future of these products has been forecast by means of the evaluation of on going clinical trials. Results: The various reviews and meta-analysis on the effect on women's health are controversial. The contradictory results may be due, among other factors, to the lack of uniformity in the compounds under study. Data on doses and genistein content have indicated beneficial effects on lipid profile, like antioxidants, as well as a mild decrease in hot flushes. Some studies suggest a positive effect on bone mass. However few data are avalaible on other aspects such as breast cancer, estrogen-dependent cancer, cognitive function, or skin. On the other hand, there are several on going clinical trials using- in some cases- high doses of isoflavones as 200 or 300 mg/daily. They focus on: osteoporosis, osteopenia and bone markers; breast cancer prevention and breast density; cardiovascular disease and hypertension; cognitive function, and fibromyalgia. Conclusions: In certain situations, phytoestrogens can be a therapeutic alternative during the climateric period. However, in general. more specific clinical trials should be performed.

Exogenous estrogens increase the risk of developing breast cancer and could counteract benefit from adjuvant hormonal manipulations in women with a history of breast cancer. We designed a study to determine the effects of lavender and tea tree oil on healthy postmenopausal women's FSH as a means to determine the estrogenic effect of both products. Hot flashes are a side effect of decreased endogenous estrogen, and in this study we used hot flash severity as an additional assay of estrogenic effect. Methods: Lavender lotion and tea tree oil products were generously donated by The Body Shop. Nine healthy postmenopausal women suffering from hot flashes were asked to apply lavender lotion and tea tree oil according to product directions for a week each, with a washout period in between. Participants were menopausal with baseline FSH > 26 IU/mL. Serum FSH was obtained at baseline, after each lotion and after the washout period. Participants also recorded daily hot flash number and severity. Average daily hot flash severity was calculated for each patient during each period, with lotion use periods compared to Paired, 2-tailed T-tests were used to compare average hot flash severity for each participant as well as FSH values as compared to the baseline obtained before it. Results: Compliance was excellent. No significant differences were seen between time periods with either product for either measure. In no case did FSH dip to premenopausal levels. No indication of improvement in hot flash frequency or severity was seen. Conclusions: In our population, the lavender and tea tree oil products showed no estrogenic effects. This is similar to clinical trials of phytoestrogens, which as used by humans are not potent enough to affect FSH or hot flash severity. Both lotions can probably be used without increasing the risk of recurrent or de novo breast cancer.

Materials and Methods: Sixty four-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD)female rats were allotted to one of six groups. Four weeks after reproducing the osteoporosis model of ovariectomized SD rats, Sham group and control OVX were administrated with distilled water, whereas the other groups received valerate estriol (800 mug/kgd) and different doses of daidzein (10, 50, 200 mg/kgd) by gavage respectively for three months. These parameterswere measured after the sacrifice of the rats. Using a dual energy x-ray absorptiometer, bone mineral density were measured in the lumbar spine L1-5and left femur. The expressions of mRNA of ERalpha, ERbeta and PPAR in L6 and right femur were measured by realtime-RT-PCR, while proteins were measured by immunohistochemistry. Uterus and lacteal gland were detected by pathological test. Results: The BMD and histomorphometry of lumbar spine and left femur decreased in OVX group while these indexes increased in L-Dai group significantly, similar with E2 group, but higer than M-Dai and H-Dai groups. The expressions of ERbeta mRNA and protein of lumbar spine and left femur in L-Dai and M-Dai groups were significantly higher than OVX group. Only the expressions of ERbeta mRNA and protein of lumbar spine in H-Dai group were higher than OVX group significantly, and these of left femur between two groups showed no significant difference.

Development of assays to characterize these phytoestrogens is required. In this study, differential estrogenicities of five isoflavonoids found in red clover and soy, including biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, genistein and glycitein were examined in a yeast-based screen system with a classical palindromic estrogen response element (ERE)-ADE2 reporter and in a MCF-7 cell culture system with mRNA levels of ER-dependent genes compared. In a yeast-based assay, five isoflavonoids showed various extents of estrogenic potencies. A collection of primary estrogen receptor (ER)-regulated genes by estradiol (E2), including hTERT, c-MYC, BCL2 and Ha-ras (oncogenic) and quinone reductase (QR), human complement 3 (C3) and COX7RP (non-oncogenic) were selected as marker genes for a MCF-7 cell-based endogenous gene expression assay. The results indicated that the mRNA levels of these E2-ER-ERE-dependent marker genes were regulated differentially by five isoflavonoids, leading to distinct expression patterns, which are also significantly different from that of E2. Moreover, the anti-estrogenic effects of biochanin A and formononetin on E2-induced transcriptions of marker genes in MCF-7 cells were also displayed. Taken together, these results are significant for these naturally occurring isoflavonoids regarding the issues of safety and efficacy. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Ge","Protective effects of phytoestrogen alpha-zearalanol on beta amyloid 25-35 induced oxidative damage in cultured rat hippocampal neurons","Although experimental evidence has shown that the neuroprotective effect from estrogen may benefit postmenopausal women, but the clinical use of estrogen was limited by the risk of increasing the cases of mammary and endometrial cancer. This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of a novel phytoestrogen alpha-zearalanol (alpha-ZAL), on the cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Following a 24-h exposure of the cells to amyloid beta-peptide fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35), a significant reduction in cell survival and activities of total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as increased of malondialdehyde (MDA) were observed. Preincubation of the cells with alpha-ZAL or 17beta-estradiol(17beta-E2) prior to Abeta25-35 exposure elevated the cell survival and SOD and GSH-Px activities, and decreased the level of MDA. These data suggested that the phytoestrogen alpha-ZAL, like estrogen, may effectively antagonize Abeta25-35-induced cell toxicity, which might be beneficial for neurons. 2007 Humana Press Inc.",NA,"animal cell article cell damage cell survival controlled study drug effect enzyme activity hippocampus neuroprotection nonhuman oxidative stress priority journal rat *alpha zearalenol/pd [Pharmacology] amyloid beta protein[25-35] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] glutathione peroxidase/ec [Endogenous Compound] malonaldehyde/ec [Endogenous Compound] superoxide dismutase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","206-211","32","2007",-1

Kucuk","Lycopene and soy isoflavones in the treatment of prostate cancer","Dietary intake of lycopene and soy has been associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer. In vitro studies with lycopene and genistein, a soy isoflavone, have shown induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth in androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC3 and VeCaP) prostate cancer cell lines. In a previous Phase II clinical trial in prostate cancer patients, we observed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) stabilization with soy isoflavone intake. In this Phase II clinical trial, we investigated the efficacy of lycopene alone or in combination with soy isoflavones on serum PSA levels in men with prostate cancer. To be eligible for the study, men with prostate cancer had to have rising serum PSA following local therapy or while on hormone therapy. Study population included 71 eligible patients who had 3 successive rising PSA levels or a minimum PSA of 10 ng/ml at 2 successive evaluations prior to starting therapy. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a tomato extract capsule containing 15 mg of lycopene alone (n = 38) or together with a capsule containing 40 mg of a soy isoflavone mixture (n = 33) twice daily orally for a maximum of 6 mo. One patient on the lycopene arm did not receive therapy due to his inability to ingest the study pill. There was no decline in serum PSA in either group qualifying for a partial or complete response. However, 35 of 37 (95%) evaluable patients in the lycopene group and 22 of 33 (67%) evaluable patients in the lycopene plus soy isoflavone group achieved stable disease described as stabilization in serum PSA level. The data suggest that lycopene and soy isoflavones have activity in prostate cancer patients with PSA relapse disease and may delay progression of both hormone-refractory and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. However, there may not be an additive effect between the 2 compounds when taken together. Future studies are warranted to further investigate the efficacy of lycopene and soy isoflavones in prostate cancer as well as the mechanism of potential negative interaction between them.

Methods: Thirteen postmenopausal women (>6 yr since menopause) were predosed with 41Ca iv. After a 200-d baseline period, subjects were given 43 g soy protein/d that contained 0, 97.5, or 135.5 mg total isoflavones in randomized order. The soy protein isolate powder was incorporated into baked products and beverages. Each 50-d intervention phase was preceded by a 50-d pretreatment phase for comparison. Serum isoflavone levels and biochemical markers were measured at the end of each phase. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected approximately every 10 d during each phase for 41Ca/Ca analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry. Results: Serum isoflavone levels reflected the amount of isoflavones consumed in a dose-dependent manner. None of the isoflavone levels had a significant effect on biochemical markers of bone turnover, urinary cross-linked N teleopeptides of type I collagen and serum osteocalcin, or bone turnover as assessed by urinary 41Ca/Ca ratios. Conclusions: Soy protein with isoflavone doses of up to 135.5 mg/d did not suppress bone resorption in postmenopausal women. This is the first efficacy trial using the novel technique of urinary 41Ca excretion from prelabeled bone.

Dose-dependent cytotoxic effects were monitored through changes in mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity using the standard MTT assay. The median inhibitory concentration (GI 50) determined from the dose-response curves showed that the aglycones apigenin and quercetin were the most bioactive (low GI50), whilst daidzein and genistein, which had not been previously tested on these cell lines, showed a smaller cytotoxic effect (high GI50).

Large-scale randomized placebo-controlled trials have documented the efficacy of a number of agents in reducing vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Anti-resorptive agents (hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, calcitonin and bisphosphonates) and bone-forming anabolic agents (parathyroid horomone and strontium ranelate) act via different mechanisms to reduce fractures and improve bone strength. In view of the high prevalence of calcium and vitamin D insufficiency in Asia, calcium and vitamin D supplementation remains a fundamental part of any treatment regimen, especially among the elderly.

Equol significantly inhibited proliferation in MDA-MB-453 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, equol at low concentrations (<1 muM) stimulated proliferation in MCF-7 cells, with increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and only inhibited proliferation at a high concentration (100 muM). Similarly, equol treatment of MDA-MB-453 cells resulted in significant cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition and in the G2/M phase, whereas it caused the slight cell cycle arrest of MCF-7 cells in the G2/M phase after 72 h of treatment. Also, when cells were treated with 50 and 100 muM equol for 72 h, the equol affected cell cycle regulatory proteins more significantly in MDA-MB-453 than in MCF-7 cells. During equol-induced apoptosis, equol increased the number of cells in the sub-G0 phase and enhanced the level of p53.

Patients and methods: Patients with untreated, localised prostatic adenocarcinoma on a prospective clinical study of active surveillance had urine samples collected at baseline. Patients underwent monitoring with serial PSA levels and repeat octant prostate biopsies. Disease progression was defined as either adverse histology on repeat biopsy (primary Gleason grade >4, or >50% positive cores) or radical treatment for PSA velocity >1 ng/mL/year. Time to disease progression was analysed with respect to baseline urinary levels of genistein, enterolactone, daidzein and equol, assayed using liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. Results: 191 patients were evaluable, with a median follow-up of 2.5 years. 71 patients experienced disease progression. No significant association was seen between time to disease progression and baseline urinary levels of daidzein (p=0.85), genistein (p=0.81), enterolactone (p=0.085) or equol (p=0.33). No significant association was seen between adverse histology on repeat biopsy and urinary levels of either daidzein (p=0.85), genistein (p=0.58), enterolactone (p=0.88) or equol (p=0.71).

Experimental feeding was done for a period of 90 days including a 6-day metabolism trial. To assess the growth performance, lambs were weighed every 15 days throughout the experimental period. All the lambs were intramuscularly inoculated with a single dose (2 ml) of haemorrhagic septicaemia oil adjuvant vaccine on 0 day to evaluate the humoral immune response. Blood samples were collected on 0 day and thereafter at 30 days interval. Results revealed that supplementation of Se both at 0.15 and 0.30 ppm levels had no significant (P>0.05) effect on intake and digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein (CP), ether extract, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and hemicellulose; balances of calcium and phosphorus; and level and intake of digestible CP and total digestible nutrients. Se supplementation also had no significant (P>0.05) effect on the levels of serum total cholesterol, total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, tri-iodothyronine (T 3), thyroxine (T4), and T4/T3 ratio; and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase enzyme activity in the lambs. However, there was a significant (P<0.05) increase in the plasma Se levels, red blood cell glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity, and humoral immune response in both the Se-supplemented groups. Feed (TMR) required per kilogram gain was less by 11.1% and 16.5% in groups T2 and T3, respectively, as compared to control (T1) group. Average daily gain was highest (108.5 g) in group T3, followed by group T2 (98.2 g), and lowest (89.06 g) in the control group (T1).

Herbs and other botanical agents, despite common public belief, are not benign. They should be understood as unrefined pharmaceuticals, with the capacity to produce physiologic change for better or worse.

This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of extracted soy isoflavones alone (not ingested concurrently with soy protein) on total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. MEDLINE (1966-2007), EMBASE (1966-2007), CENTRAL (1966-2007), ICHUSHI (1983-2008), and CNKI (1979-2007) were searched for randomized placebo-controlled trials published in English, Japanese, and Chinese, describing the changes in lipid profiles in adult humans resulting from ingestion of extracted soy isoflavones for 1-3 months. Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses were hand-searched. Meta-analysis of 10 and 9 trials with usable information using REVMAN found that an average of 70 mg soy isoflavones/day (27-132 mg, as the aglycone form) alone had a nonsignificant effect on total (0.01 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.12, 0.14]; P = 0.86) and LDL (0.03 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.11, 0.16]; P = 0.71) cholesterol in menopausal women, respectively. It is concluded that ingestion of about 70 mg extracted soy isoflavones/day alone for 1-3 months does not improve total and LDL cholesterol levels in normocholesterolemic menopausal women; further studies are needed to verify the effects of extracted soy isoflavones. 2008 Taku et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.",NA,"article bloating/si [Side Effect] breast cancer/si [Side Effect] cholesterol blood level clinical trial controlled clinical trial diet restriction drug efficacy drug mechanism drug safety human *hypercholesterolemia/dt [Drug Therapy] lifestyle modification menopause menstrual irregularity/si [Side Effect] meta analysis paresthesia/si [Side Effect] protein content protein polymorphism randomized controlled trial sensitivity analysis soybean stomach pain/si [Side Effect] systematic review aglycone/ct [Clinical Trial] aglycone/do [Drug Dose] aglycone/dt [Drug Therapy] daidzein/ct [Clinical Trial] daidzein/do [Drug Dose] daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] genistein/do [Drug Dose] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *isoflavone derivative/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] low density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] placebo","1097-1103","4","2008",-1

It is a preventable disease in part, and primary care providers and public health programs play a key role in providing cancer preventive care. There are several health behaviors that may reduce the risk of breast cancer, including prolonged lactation; regular physical activity; avoiding overweight, obesity, and lifetime weight gain; avoiding excess alcohol intake; avoiding prolonged use of exogenous hormone therapy; and avoiding excessive radiation. These behaviors, although they have not been proven in clinical trials to reduce risk, are likely to be beneficial; information on them can be provided as a prevention strategy in countries of diverse means, although the methods of information delivery and follow-up will depend on financial and personnel resources. Many of these health behaviors can reduce the risk for other chronic diseases and, thus, may be of great interest for general public health. In high resource level countries, additional prevention methods are available for high-risk women, including selective estrogen response modulators and, for women at very high risk, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. Most women can benefit from advice and preventive care for reducing their risk for breast cancer. 2008 American Cancer Society.",NA,"alcohol consumption *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] breast feeding education cancer invasion cancer prevention cancer risk chronic disease clinical trial conference paper dietary intake follow up health behavior health care personnel health care planning *health program high risk population hormonal therapy human lactation mastectomy meta analysis obesity ovariectomy physical activity priority journal risk reduction systematic review weight control weight gain estrogen isoflavone lignan mineral oral contraceptive agent vitamin","2325-2330","113","2008",-1

Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by using TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) assays (rs6259) or the Affymetrix MegAllele Targeted Genotyping System (Affymetrix, Inc., US) (rs13894, rs858521, and rs2955617). Dietary information was obtained using a validated food frequency questionnaire. A logistic regression model was employed to compute adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that the Asp327Asn (rs6259) polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of endometrial cancer, particularly among postmenopausal women (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.62-1.00). This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) modified associations of soy isoflavones and tea consumption but not fiber intake with endometrial cancer, with the inverse association of soy intake and tea consumption being more evident for those with the Asp/Asp genotype of the SHBG gene at Asp327Asn (rs6259), particularly premenopausal women (Pinteraction = 0.06 and 0.02, respectively, for soy isoflavones and tea intake). This study suggests that gene-diet interaction may play an important role in the etiology of endometrial cancer risk.

Methods: The effects of puerarin on the P450arom mRNA expression were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The 5'-flanking region was amplified by PCR using human genomic cDNA as a template. By means of the restriction sites and sequence confirmation, the PCR product was cloned into reporter vector. Series of sequential deletion reporter constructs were transiently transfected into RL95-2 cells which were treated with or without puerarin. Luciferase activity was measured by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System and Luminoskan Ascent luminometer. Furthermore, by using web-based search program, the most possible cis-acting elements and transcription factors were evaluated. Results: The data demonstrated that low-dose puerarin treatment could decrease P450arom expression at mRNA level compared to dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) treatment (P<0.01), and puerarin (10-7 mol/L) had a time-course effect on P450arom mRNA expression, which reached the bottom at 12 h (P < 0.01). Cells transfected with the - 763/+8 bp constructs showed decrease in relative luciferase activity after puerarin (10-7 mol/L) treatment compared to DMSO treatment (P < 0.05), indicating an essential regulatory site between -763 bp and -543 bp responsible for the transcription suppression by puerarin. Furthermore, the most possible transcription factors, which turned out to be AP-1(c-jun/c-fos) at -410/ -401 bp were also evaluated. The activity of exogenous AP-1 was reduced after 12 hours of puerarin treatment (P<0.05). The inhibition of c-jun mRNA also showed a time-course effect, which bottomed out at 12 h in parallel with that of P450arom(P<0.01). The protein level of c-jun was also down-regulated by puerarin (10-7mol/ L) treatment at 12 h. Conclusion: The suppression of P450arom expressiqn and activity may be associated with the down-regulation of transcription factor AP-1/ c-jun.

Saatcioglu","Genistein differentially modulates androgen-responsive gene expression and activates JNK in LNCaP cells","Genistein, the predominant isoflavone in soy, may be chemopreventive in prostate cancer (CaP). It down-regulates the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and androgen receptor (AR) in androgen responsive cells. However, the extent of the down-regulation and whether genistein has a general effect on all androgen responsive genes (ARGs) are unclear. We investigated the ability of genistein to modulate ARG expression by the synthetic androgen R1881 in LNCaP cells. Given that there is important crosstalk between AR and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, we also investigated whether genistein activates the MAPK end targets c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun. Changes in ARG expression were determined by Western analysis and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The activation of JNK and c-Jun was investigated by Western analysis and a solid phase kinase assay. The PSA protein and mRNA expression were both down-regulated by genistein. In contrast, KLK4 was upregulated at the mRNA, but down-regulated at the protein level. NKX3.1 mRNA levels did not change significantly, but protein levels were significantly down-regulated. STAMP2 mRNA levels slightly increased whereas the protein expression was down-regulated. The AR mRNA expression changed significantly only at high concentrations of genistein when it was down-regulated, whereas AR protein levels were decreased at low concentrations of genistein. The solid phase kinase assay indicated a transient activation of JNK by genistein, which was supported by Western analysis. Thus genistein differentially modulates ARG mRNA expression, but has an inhibitory role on the ARG protein levels. The activation of the JNK pathway which inhibits AR signaling may provide a mechanism for the overall inhibition of protein levels.",NA,"article cell strain LNCaP controlled study down regulation *enzyme activation enzyme assay *gene expression regulation human human cell priority journal protein expression reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction signal transduction upregulation Western blotting *androgen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein kallikrein/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein c jun/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein KLK4/ec [Endogenous Compound] *stress activated protein kinase transcription factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Nkx3/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","1231-1235","19","2008",-1

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the prodrug on bone in ovariectomised (OVX) rats. Methods: Forty-eight adult Sprague-Dawley female rats were ovariectomised and treated with vehicle, 9mg/kg genistein and 4.5, 9 or 18 mg/kg NO-G by oral administration daily. The bioassays were performed in terms of bone mineral density (BMD), mechanical testing, bone formation markers, bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN) and bone resorption marker urine deoxypyridinoline (DPD). In addition, the effects of the drugs on uterus and body weight were examined. Results: After treatment for 12 week, the BMD of whole femur and tibia in the NO-G (9 and 18 mg/kg) groups were 12.1% and 12.2% higher than that of OVX group (P <0.01); the bending strength of the femur was 11.2% and 12.2% higher than OVX group (P <0.01). The OVX-induced increase of serum b-ALP, OCN and urinary DPD were markedly attenuated. The prodrug showed no side effects on uterus and body weight.

Hughes","Black cohosh increases metastatic mammary cancer in transgenic mice expressing c-erbB2","Black cohosh is an herbal extract that is often used as an alternative to estrogen-based replacement therapies to treat hot flushes that frequently accompany the transition to menopause. Although cancer-free women as well as breast cancer patients and survivors use black cohosh to relieve vasomotor symptoms, there is limited information on its potential to influence breast cancer development or progression. Therefore, in this study, the effects of black cohosh on mammary tumorigenesis were investigated in the MMTV-neu mouse model due to its similarities to HER2+ breast cancer, including stochastic development of mammary tumors, which frequently progress to metastatic disease. Using an adjusted dose for the mice to correlate to the recommended dose in women (40 mg/d), no differences were detected in the incidence or onset of mammary tumors in black cohosh-treated versus control females. The lack of effect on mammary tumor development suggests that black cohosh would not influence breast cancer risk if given to women before tumor formation. In contrast, black cohosh significantly increased the incidence of lung metastases in tumor-bearing animals compared with mice fed the isoflavone-free control diet. Additional studies will be needed to correlate these findings to women taking different black cohosh products at various times during breast cancer development; however, these results suggest caution for women using black cohosh, especially for extended periods of time. As metastatic progression is linked to patient survival, these data stress the importance of investigating how women's therapies influence all stages of mammary tumorigenesis, particularly for assessing their safety. 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue article *breast cancer cancer risk cancer survival carcinogenesis controlled study diet female lung metastasis *metastasis mouse nonhuman priority journal *Cimicifuga racemosa extract/to [Drug Toxicity] *epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]","8377-8383","68","2008",-1

Morre","tNOX (ENOX2) target for chemosensitization-low-dose responses in the hormetic concentration range","An emerging concept of cancer chemotherapy is that of chemosensitization. Most often applied to the treatment of drug-resistance cancers, chemosensitization has utility when such cancers are rendered drug sensitive through treatment with the sensitizing agent. A particularly striking example of chemosensitization is that encountered with the synthetic isoflavene phenoxodiol where patients with taxane- and/or platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma once again become sensitive to these drugs following treatment with phenoxodiol. The latter appears to be a true chemosensitization in that the phenoxodiol need not be co-administered with the taxane or platinum.drugs. Sensitivity is retained many weeks after the phenoxodiol has been cleared from the system. The response appears to be mediated through the primary drug target of phenoxodiol, a cancer-specific cell surface ECTO-NOX or ENOX protein designated tNOX (ENOX2). The ENOX protein family has been previously recognized as a hormetic target. The hypothesis under investigation is that chemosensitization and low dose synergies are most obvious in the hormetic range of concentrations and that the two phenomena, hormesis and chemosensitization, may be related mechanistically. 2008 Science Publications.",NA,"antineoplastic activity article cancer inhibition cancer resistance *chemosensitization combination chemotherapy controlled study drug potentiation drug response drug sensitivity drug targeting hormesis human human cell monotherapy nucleotide sequence *ovary cancer *uterine cervix carcinoma cisplatin/cb [Drug Combination] cisplatin/cm [Drug Comparison] cisplatin/it [Drug Interaction] cisplatin/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone derivative/cb [Drug Combination] *isoflavone derivative/it [Drug Interaction] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] paclitaxel/cb [Drug Combination] paclitaxel/it [Drug Interaction] paclitaxel/pd [Pharmacology] *phenoxodiol/cb [Drug Combination] *phenoxodiol/it [Drug Interaction] *phenoxodiol/pd [Pharmacology] *reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] sulforaphane/cb [Drug Combination] sulforaphane/cm [Drug Comparison] sulforaphane/it [Drug Interaction] sulforaphane/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","16-26","3","2008",-1

Materials and methods: C57BL/6J female mice received a single subcutaneous injection of genistein (200 mg/kg) 24 h prior to a lethal dose (7.75 Gy, 60Co) of total body irradiation. Proliferation-associated Ki-67 protein/7-aminoactinomycin-D (Ki67/7AAD) cell cycle staining was used to differentiate between G0, G1, and S/G2/M in bone marrow cell populations negative for expression of mature hematopoietic lineage marker cells but positive for expression of stem cell antigen-1 and tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor (Lin-Sca-1+cKit+, LSK+). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) microarrays were utilized to examine cell cycle specific genes. Results: At 24 h following radiation exposure, a greater percentage of LSK+ in genistein-treated mice accumulated in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, whereas a large percentage of LSK+ bone marrow cells from untreated and vehicle (PEG-400)-treated mice progressed into the G1 and S/G2/M phases.

Ford","Elimination of menstrual-related migraine beneficially impacts chronification and medication overuse","Objectives. - This study seeks to determine whether menstrual-related migraine (MRM) has a discrete, attributable impact on migraine chronicity and medication overuse. Background. - Menstrual-related migraine can be a disabling headache on its own; but when seen in headache clinics, it is often enmeshed in the setting of chronic migraine (CM) and medication overuse headache (MOH). Whereas nonspecific migraine preventives bestow their benefit uniformly, hormonal preventives (HPs) - when they are successful - address a discrete hormonal mechanism. They confer no known benefit to migraines that are not hormonally triggered. This selective property of HPs could potentially isolate MRM and segregate its effect on the overall clinical picture. Methods. - This is a retrospective review of 229 consecutive women seen in follow-up for hormonal prevention of MRM at an academic headache center. Patients kept standardized diaries from which separate menstrual-week (MW) and non-menstrual week (nonMW) headache indices were calculated and compared. Resolution of MRM was defined by reduction of the MW headache index to a score not exceeding the nonMW headache indices. Consumption of all acute and preventive agents used in the preceding month was tallied. We performed post-treatment comparisons of medication usage and headache characteristics among subjects in whom MRM was resolved and those in whom it was not resolved. Results. - At baseline, CM was present in 92% of subjects, 72% of whom also met criteria for MOH. Resolution of MRM was achieved in 81% of subjects who were compliant with HP and was associated with reversion to episodic migraine (59% vs 18%, P <.001) and resolution of medication overuse (54% vs 20%, P <.001). Resolution of MRM was associated with significant decreases in per capita consumption of triptans, opioids, all acute agents, and migraine preventive medications. Conclusions. - Resolution of MRM correlated not only with conversion of CM to an episodic pattern, but also with a significant reduction in medication usage. It offers preliminary evidence that hormonal regimens may have a beneficial role in prevention of MRM. 2008 the Authors.",NA,"adenomyosis adult age distribution article body mass chronicity comorbidity disease severity drug use dysmenorrhea endometriosis evening dosage female *hormone substitution human low drug dose major clinical study menopausal syndrome menorrhagia menstrual irregularity *menstrual migraine/dt [Drug Therapy] *menstrual migraine/pc [Prevention] metrorrhagia ovary cyst ovary polycystic disease priority journal prophylaxis retrospective study *transformed migraine/dt [Drug Therapy] uterus myoma analgesic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] butalbital/dt [Drug Therapy] caffeine/dt [Drug Therapy] conjugated estrogen/do [Drug Dose] conjugated estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] decongestive agent/dt [Drug Therapy] drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] ergot derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] *estrogen/do [Drug Dose] *estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *estrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] ethinylestradiol/do [Drug Dose] ethinylestradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] ethinylestradiol plus etonogestrel/dt [Drug Therapy] ethinylestradiol plus norgestimate/do [Drug Dose] ethinylestradiol plus norgestimate/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] muscle relaxant agent/dt [Drug Therapy] narcotic analgesic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] tricyclen lo triptan derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] unclassified drug","1186-1193","48","2008",-1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory growth effects of different potential chemopreventive agents in vitro and to determine their influence on PSA mRNA and protein expression with an established screening platform. METHODS. LNCaP and C4-2 cells were incubated with genistein, seleno-L-methionine, lycopene, DL-alpha-tocopherol, and trans-beta-carotene at three different concentrations and cell growth was determined by the MTT assay. PSA mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and secreted PSA protein levels were quantified by the microparticle enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS. Genistein, seleno-L-methionine and lycopene inhibited LNCaP cell growth, and the proliferation of C4-2 cells was suppressed by seleno-L-methionine and lycopene. PSA mRNA expression was downregulated by genistein in LNCaP but not C4-2 cells. No other compound tested altered PSA mRNA expression. PSA protein expression was downregulated by genistein, seleno-L-methionine, DL-alpha-tocopherol in LNCaP cells. In C4-2 cells only genistein significantly reduced the secretion of PSA protein. CONCLUSIONS. In the LNCaP progression model PSA expression depends on the compound, its concentration and on the hormonal dependence of the cell line used and does not necessarily reflect cell growth or death. Before potential substances are evaluated in clinical trials using PSA as a surrogate end point marker, their effect on PSA mRNA and protein expression has to be considered to correctly assess treatment response by PSA. 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"article cancer cell culture *cancer growth cancer model cancer prevention cell proliferation cell strain LNCaP concentration response controlled study down regulation gene expression regulation human human cell male microparticle enzyme immunoassay priority journal *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] protein expression protein secretion quantitative analysis real time polymerase chain reaction treatment response 3 (4,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide alpha tocopherol/pd [Pharmacology] beta carotene/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] lycopene/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] selenomethionine/pd [Pharmacology]","1307-1318","68","2008",-1
"1459","1375"," M. Messina","Investigating the optimal soy protein and isoflavone intakes for women: A perspective","Traditional soyfoods have been consumed for centuries throughout much of East Asia and, recently, these foods have also become popular in the West. Soyfoods and specific soybean components, such as the protein and isoflavones, have attracted attention for their possible health benefits. Isoflavones are classified as phytoestrogens and have been postulated to be natural alternatives to hormone therapy for menopausal women. To provide guidance on optimal soy intake, this article evaluates Asian soy consumption and both clinical and Asian epiclemiologic studies that examined the relationship between soy intake and a variety of health outcomes. On the basis of these data and the standard principles of dietary practice the author suggests that optimal soy protein and isoflavone intakes are 15-20 g/day and 50-90 mg/day, respectively. In addition, an intake of 25 g/day soy protein can be specifically used as the recommendation for cholesterol reduction. 2008 Future Medicine Ltd.",NA,"artery compliance artery endothelium article Asia atherosclerosis/dt [Drug Therapy] atherosclerosis/pc [Prevention] bone density breast cancer/si [Side Effect] clinical trial cognition cognitive defect/si [Side Effect] congestive cardiomyopathy/dt [Drug Therapy] congestive cardiomyopathy/pc [Prevention] diet supplementation dose response drug blood level drug dose comparison drug mechanism drug protein binding drug structure endocrine disease/si [Side Effect] endometrium cancer/si [Side Effect] endometrium hyperplasia/si [Side Effect] female food analysis food composition food intake fragility fracture/co [Complication] fragility fracture/dt [Drug Therapy] fragility fracture/pc [Prevention] geographic distribution heart infarction/dt [Drug Therapy] heart infarction/pc [Prevention] hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] hot flush/pc [Prevention] human ischemic heart disease/dt [Drug Therapy] ischemic heart disease/ep [Epidemiology] ischemic heart disease/et [Etiology] ischemic heart disease/pc [Prevention] nonhuman nutrient supply nutritional assessment *nutritional health nutritional value osteopenia/dt [Drug Therapy] osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] osteoporosis/ep [Epidemiology] osteoporosis/et [Etiology] osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] postmenopause *protein intake quality control risk reduction thyroid disease/si [Side Effect] *women's health aglycone/an [Drug Analysis] biochanin A daidzein/an [Drug Analysis] formononetin genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] glycitein/an [Drug Analysis] *isoflavone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] *isoflavone/cb [Drug Combination] *isoflavone/cr [Drug Concentration] *isoflavone/do [Drug Dose] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] placebo raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] *soybean protein/do [Drug Dose] *soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] *soybean protein/pd [Pharmacology] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology]","337-356","4","2008",-1

Hrushesky","Seasonal modulation of post-resection breast cancer metastasis","Background: Human breast cancer incidence, histopathologic grade, invasiveness, and mortality risk vary significantly throughout each year. In order to better understand this seasonal cancer biology, we investigated the circannual pattern of post-resection breast cancer metastasis, under genetically and environmentally controlled conditions. Methods: Over a span of 14 consecutive years, we conducted 22 similar experiments to investigate metastatic biology of breast cancer among 1,214 C3HeB/FeJ female mice. All mice were kept in temperature-controlled environment with 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod, with food and water freely available, from birth until death. At 10-13 weeks of age, each mouse received 20,000 viable syngeneic mammary cancer cells subcutaneously and the tumor bearing leg was resected 10-12 days after tumor inoculation for potential cure. Once 10% of resected mice were found moribund, due to autopsy proven pulmonary metastases, all remaining mice were sacrificed and metastatic lung nodules were counted. Results: The incidence of post-resection pulmonary metastasis was not randomly distributed throughout the year, but peaked prominently in Summer and Winter. Although tumor volume at resection was strongly associated with metastatic potential, a significantly higher probability of pulmonary metastasis was observed if surgery was performed in Summer and Winter, regardless of tumor volume at resection, compared to Spring and Fall. Conclusion: These results support the likelihood that human breast cancer seasonality is real and of biological origin. There are implications of this cancer chronobiology for breast cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"animal experiment animal model article *breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *breast cancer/su [Surgery] cancer incidence cancer mortality chronobiology circannual rhythm controlled study diet female humidity lung metastasis/co [Complication] mastectomy *metastasis/co [Complication] mouse nonhuman priority journal room temperature *seasonal variation statistical analysis tumor volume tumor xenograft phytoestrogen","219-228","111","2008",-1

To assess factors that impaired the quality of life of these patients. Material and methods: A questionnaire assessing quality of life was sent to 325 breast cancer patients. A 66% valid response rate was obtained. Among these responses, 169 women were postmenopausal. The following results concern these patients only. Results: Forty-five women were using some treatment to alleviate certain menopausal symptoms (26.6%). More than half of the patients used no therapy to alleviate menopausal symptoms, either because they had no symptoms (n=43; 25.4%), they feared breast cancer recurrence (n=24; 14.2%), they were advised not to use a treatment (n=27; 16%), it had been shown to be inefficient (n=5; 3%), or because of contraindication (n=3; 1.8%). In this survey, 62.3% of postmenopausal women affected by breast cancer suffered from hot flushes (n=94), of which half were severe (n=46). Among women suffering from hot flushes, a third used various products to alleviate their symptoms (n=30). Younger women suffered more often from vasomotor symptoms than did older women (p<0.000). Current users of aromatase inhibitors suffered more from sexual disorders than did non-users (p<0.001). They had more often an unsatisfactory sexual life (p<0.01), more vaginal dryness (p=0.01) and a decreased libido (p<0.02) compared to non-users.

Deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (DF508) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis (CF). Effective pharmacological therapy of CF caused by the DF508-CFTR mutation requires the rescue of both intracellular processing and channel gating defects. 2. We identified a class of natural coumarin compounds that can correct the defective DF508-CFTR chloride channel gating by screening a collection of 386 single natural compounds from Chinese medicinal herbs. Screening was performed with an iodide influx assay in Fischer rat thyroid epithelial cells coexpressing DF508-CFTR and an iodide-sensitive fluorescent indicator (YFP-H148Q/I152L). 3. Dose-dependent potentiation of defective DF508-CFTR chloride channel gating by five coumarin compounds was demonstrated by the fluorescent iodide influx assay and confirmed by an Ussing chamber short-circuit current assay. Activation was fully abolished by the specific CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172. Two potent compounds, namely imperatorin and osthole, have activation Kd values of approximately 10 mmol/L, as determined by the short-circuit current assay. The active coumarin compounds do not elevate intracellular cAMP levels. Activation of DF508-CFTR by the coumarin compounds requires cAMP agonist, suggesting direct interaction with the mutant CFTR molecule. Kinetics analysis indicated rapid activation of DF508-CFTR by the coumarin compounds, with half-maximal activation of < 5 min. The activating effect was fully reversed for all five active compounds 45 min after washout. 4. In conclusion, the natural coumarin DF508-CFTR activators may represent a new class of natural lead compounds for the development of pharmacological therapies for CF caused by the DF508 mutation. 2008 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",NA,"animal cell article channel gating Chinese herb controlled study dose response drug antagonism drug identification drug mechanism drug protein binding drug screening epithelium cell Fischer 344 rat fluorescence analysis nonhuman protein expression rat thyroid gland *angelicin/an [Drug Analysis] *angelicin/cb [Drug Combination] *angelicin/cm [Drug Comparison] *angelicin/do [Drug Dose] *angelicin/it [Drug Interaction] *angelicin/pd [Pharmacology] chloride channel *coumarin derivative/an [Drug Analysis] *coumarin derivative/cb [Drug Combination] *coumarin derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] *coumarin derivative/do [Drug Dose] *coumarin derivative/it [Drug Interaction] *coumarin derivative/pd [Pharmacology] forskolin/cb [Drug Combination] forskolin/it [Drug Interaction] forskolin/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] iodide *osthole/an [Drug Analysis] *osthole/cb [Drug Combination] *osthole/cm [Drug Comparison] *osthole/do [Drug Dose] *osthole/it [Drug Interaction] *osthole/pd [Pharmacology] *pentosalen/an [Drug Analysis] *pentosalen/cb [Drug Combination] *pentosalen/cm [Drug Comparison] *pentosalen/do [Drug Dose] *pentosalen/it [Drug Interaction] *pentosalen/pd [Pharmacology] *praeruptorin a/an [Drug Analysis] *praeruptorin a/cb [Drug Combination] *praeruptorin a/cm [Drug Comparison] *praeruptorin a/do [Drug Dose] *praeruptorin a/it [Drug Interaction] *praeruptorin a/pd [Pharmacology] protein inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] protein inhibitor/it [Drug Interaction] protein inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] *scopoletin/an [Drug Analysis] *scopoletin/cm [Drug Comparison] *scopoletin/do [Drug Dose] *scopoletin/pd [Pharmacology] transmembrane conductance regulator/ec [Endogenous Compound] transmembrane conductance regulator inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] transmembrane conductance regulator inhibitor/it [Drug Interaction] transmembrane conductance regulator inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] yellow fluorescent protein","878-883","35","2008",-1

Therefore, we investigated the development of bones in young, middleaged, and aged female rats. Because most rat chows contain soy proteins, including estrogenic isoflavones, as a source of protein, comparison of effects on mineral density and on areas of the cancellous and cortical parts of the metaphysis of the tibia as measured by quantitative computer tomography in animals fed with soy-free and soy-containing food was made. As surrogate parameters of bone metabolism serum, osteocalcin (OC) and the breakdown products of bone collagen-the Crosslaps-were also determined. The cancellous density increased between day 25 after birth to reach peak bone mass at 90 days of age; in 18-and 20-month-old animals, significant reduction was observed that was more profound in the animals fed with soy-free food. Serum OC and the Crosslaps were highest in 15-day-old and lowest in 9-, 18-, and 20-month-old animals. Animals fed with soy-containing food had significantly higher osteocalcin levels at day 15 and at 9 and 18 months of age. In the aged animals, intake of soy isoflavones that have an estrogenic effect appears to exert beneficial effects as these aged animals lost less cancellous bone, as indicated by their surrogate parameters of metabolism in the serum. It is concluded that exorbitantly high bone turnover is present in immature and peripubertal rats. Raising and keeping female rats under soy-free or soy-containing conditions has marked effects on several bone parameters that are of particular relevance in aged animals. 2008 Springer.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article birth bone density *bone development bone mass bone metabolism bone turnover cancellous bone computer assisted tomography controlled study cortical bone disease marker female groups by age maturation metaphysis nonhuman priority journal protein blood level puberty quantitative analysis rat serum *soybean tibia *carboxy terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] daidzein genistein isoflavone *osteocalcin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soybean protein","321-327","26","2008",-1

We examined the association of intake of total flavonoids and 7 flavonoid subclasses with risk of lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic and upper aerodigestive cancer among women in a large prospective cohort study. Study participants were 34,708 postmenopausal women in the Iowa Women's Health Study who completed a food frequency questionnaire and were followed for cancer occurrence from 1986 through 2004. Flavonoid intake was estimated from 3 databases developed by the USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL). Hazard ratios (HR) for cancer risk were calculated across total flavonoid and flavonoid subclass intake categories. Interactions between smoking history and flavonoid intake were also examined. After multivariable adjustment, lung cancer incidence was inversely associated with intakes of flavanones (HR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53-0.86, all results highest vs. lowest quintile) and proanthocyanidins (HR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.57-0.97).

Similar associations were not seen in never smokers. Isoflavone intake was inversely associated with overall cancer incidence (HR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.86-1.00).

Light microscopic analyses showed a porous or eroded appearance on the femoral trabecular bone surface in OVX rats, whereas the femoral trabecular bone surfaces of the other groups (control, sham, OVX(17beta-estradiol-treated), and OVX(HER-S-treated) rats) were composed of fine particles. The femoral trabecular bone area and number were decreased in OVX rats, but these reductions were significantly prevented by the administration of HER-S for 7 weeks, similar to estrogen. In the blood biochemistry results, serum phosphorus, calcium, T3, and T4 remained unchanged, but blood estrogen levels were significantly increased in HER-S-treated rats, which suggests that estrogen is related to the mechanism of the HER-S-induced antiosteoporosis function in OVX rats.

Methods: We carried outa mass screening of prostate cancer in Changchun, China, using a prostate-specific antigen assisted by Japan International Cooperation Agency. From June 1998 to December 2000, 3 940 men over 50 years old were screened. Of these, 29 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer. We selected 28 cases and matched them with controls of low prostate-specific antigen value (< 4.1 ng/mL) by 1: 10 according to age and place of employment. A case-control study of diet and prostate cancer was then carried out. Results: After adjustment for education, body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, marriage and diet, intake of soybean product was discovered to be inversely related to prostate cancer. Men who consumed soybean product more than twice per week on different days had a multivariate odds ratio (OR) of 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-1.12). In addition, men who consumed soybean products more than once per day had a multivariate OR of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.11-0.79) compared with men who consumed soybean products less than once per week. The P for trend was 0.02, which showed significant difference. There was no significant difference in P trend for any dairy food.

Thelen","Functional analysis of NKX3.1 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells by RNA interference","The function of the androgen-regulated homeo-box protein NKX3.1 in prostate cancer is controversial. NKX3.1 is necessary for correct prostate development and undergoes frequent allelic loss in prostate cancer. However, no mutations occur in the coding region and some particularly aggressive cancers over-express the protein. Nevertheless NKX3.1 is often referred to as candidate tumor suppressor gene. Recent findings suggest a function in protection against oxidative damage involved in prostate carcinogenesis. Thus NKX3.1 may act differently at various stages of prostate cancer. Unlike a classical tumor suppressor NKX3.1 is up-regulated by androgens and down-regulated by phytoestrogens. In this study we performed RNAi based functional analysis by knocking down NKX3.1 expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and analyzing the impact of NKX3.1 on gene expression and cell proliferation. Knock-down of NKX3.1 evoked a massive down-regulation of NKX3.1 expression, followed by reduction in mRNA expression of the androdrogen receptor (AR) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R). Western blot analysis showed strong decreases of NKX3.1, AR, and IGF-1R protein expression. Concomitantly, cell proliferation decreased and expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA and its secretion were diminished, whereas expression of IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and MMP tissue inhibitor 3 (TIMP-3) was up-regulated. In tumor cells not deprived of NKX3.1 expression this gene still has a function which might differ from its role in prostate development and carcinogenesis. NKX3.1 knock-down altered the expression of genes highly relevant in prostate cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. In LNCaP NKX3.1 most probably plays the role of an androgen-regulated transcription factor whose down-regulation is paralleled by anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. Since NKX3.1 can regulate AR expression it may become a target for interference in hormone refractory prostate carcinoma.",NA,"allele antigen expression apoptosis article cancer cell culture cancer staging carcinogenesis cell proliferation cell strain LNCaP controlled study down regulation drug targeting gene expression gene expression regulation gene loss gene mutation gene overexpression hormonal regulation human human cell inhibition kinetics male organogenesis oxidative stress priority journal *prostate cancer/et [Etiology] protein function protein secretion RNA interference upregulation Western blotting androgen/ec [Endogenous Compound] androgen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] homeodomain protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] phytoestrogen prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] small interfering RNA somatomedin binding protein 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] somatomedin C receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] *transcription factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *transcription factor NKX3.1/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor suppressor protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]","877-884","32","2008",-1
"1481","1393"," W. X. Chao","Health effects of soy protein and isoflavones in humans","Epidemiological investigations suggest that soy consumption may be associated with a lower incidence of certain chronic diseases. Clinical studies also show that ingestion of soy proteins reduces the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This led to the approval of the food-labeling health claim for soy proteins in the prevention of coronary heart disease by the U.S. FDA in 1999. Similar health petitions for soy proteins have also been approved thereafter in the United Kingdom, Brazil, South Africa, the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea, and Malaysia. However, the purported health benefits are quite variable in different studies. The Nutrition Committee of the American Heart Association has assessed 22 randomized trials conducted since 1999 and found that isolated soy protein with isoflavones (ISF) slightly decreased LDL cholesterol but had no effect on HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), or blood pressure. The other effects of soy consumption were not evident. Although the contributing factors to these discrepancies are not fully understood, the source of soybeans and processing procedures of the protein or ISF are believed to be important because of their effects on the content and intactness of certain bioactive protein subunits. Some studies have documented potential safety concerns on increased consumption of soy products. Impacts of soy products on thyroid and reproductive functions as well as on certain types of carcinogenesis require further study in this context. Overall, existing data are inconsistent or inadequate in supporting most of the suggested health benefits of consuming soy protein or ISF. 2008 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"blood pressure bone metabolism breast cancer cardiovascular risk clinical trial conference paper endocrine function food and drug administration human ischemic heart disease/dt [Drug Therapy] ischemic heart disease/pc [Prevention] menopause prostate cancer quality of life reproduction high density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] lipoprotein A/ec [Endogenous Compound] low density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soybean protein/ct [Clinical Trial] *soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1244S-1249S","138","2008",-1

We evaluated the efficacy of isoflavone in patients with PSA recurrent prostate cancer after prior therapy. We postulated that isoflavone therapy would slow the rate of rise of serum PSA. Methods-: Twenty patients with rising PSA after prior local therapy were enrolled in this open-labeled, Phase II, nonrandomized trial (Trial registration # NCT00596895). Patients were treated with soy milk containing 47 mg of isoflavonoid per 8 oz serving three times per day for 12 months. Serum PSA, testosterone, lipids, isoflavone levels (genistein, daidzein, and equol), and quality of life (QOL) were measured at various time points from 0 to 12 months. PSA outcome was evaluated. Results-: Within the mixed regression model, it was estimated that PSA had increased 56% per year before study entry and only increased 20% per year for the 12-month study period (p = 0.05). Specifically, the slope of PSA after study entry was significantly lower than that before study entry in 6 patients and the slope of PSA after study entry was significantly higher than before study entry in 2 patients. For the remaining 12 patients, the change in slope was statistically insignificant. Nearly two thirds of the patients were noted to have significant levels of free equol in their serum while on therapy. Conclusion-: Dietary intervention with isoflavone supplementation may have biologic activity in men with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer as shown by a decline in the slope of PSA. This study may lend support to the literature that nutritional supplements have biologic activity in prostate cancer and therefore, further studies with these agents in randomized clinical trials should be encouraged. 2008 Pendleton et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"adult aged article brachytherapy clinical article clinical protocol clinical trial diet supplementation drug efficacy external beam radiotherapy follow up human male phase 2 clinical trial *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/rt [Radiotherapy] *prostate cancer/su [Surgery] quality of life recurrent cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] recurrent cancer/rt [Radiotherapy] recurrent cancer/su [Surgery] regression analysis soybean milk daidzein equol genistein *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] lipid/ec [Endogenous Compound] *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"8","2008",-1

The effect of soy on such end points is attributed often to estrogen receptor agonism by isoflavones. Recent in vitro studies suggest that isoflavones, in combination with high estrogen concentrations (within the range seen circulating in premenopausal women), function as estrogen receptor antagonists that potentially may counteract the beneficial effects seen with soy consumption. We studied insulin sensitivity in 15 premenopausal nonhuman primates consuming either a high isoflavone soy diet or a soy-free casein/lactalbumin diet for 4 months. Insulin sensitivity was measured by intravenous glucose tolerance testing, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and protein kinase B phosphorylation levels in muscle. In addition, plasma lipids, adiponectin, thyroid hormone, and body weights are reported. We show that high isoflavones do not adversely affect insulin sensitivity but do significantly alter insulin secretion to glucose stimulation. Small but significant increases in thyroxine and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed as has been reported commonly with soy intake. These study results demonstrate that consumption of soy containing high isoflavone levels is not associated with changes in insulin sensitivity in the high estrogen milieu of the premenopausal female. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Design: We inspected the human NIS gene locus for retinoic acid-responsive elements and tested them for function. The effects of signal transduction pathway inhibitors were also tested in tRA-treated MCF-7 cells and TSH-stimulated FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, followed by iodide uptake assay, quantitative RT-PCR of NIS, and cell cycle phase analysis. Results: Multiple retinoic acid response elements around the NIS locus were identified by sequence inspection, but none of them was a functional tRA-induced element in MCF-7 cells. Inhibitors of the IGF-I receptor, Janus kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), significantly reduced NIS mRNA expression and iodide uptake in tRA-stimulated MCF-7 cells but not FRTL-5 cells. An inhibitor of p38 MAPK significantly reduced iodide uptake in both tRA-stimulated MCF-7 cells and TSH-stimulated FRTL-5 cells. IGF-I and PI3K inhibitors did not significantly reduce the basal NIS mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. Despite the chronic inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, tRA did not reduce the S-phase distribution of MCF-7 cells during the period of NIS induction. Conclusion: The IGF-I receptor/PI3K pathway mediates tRA-stimulated NIS expression in MCF-7 but not FRTL-5 thyroid cells.

Methods: In vitro HEECs and human endometrial cancer-1B cell (HEC-1B) were cultured with 0, 1, 10, 50, 100, and 200 mumol/L of genistein alone or indicated concentrations of genistein combined with 0.2 or 1 nmol/L 17beta-estradiol (17beta-E 2). Cell proliferation was determined by [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cell cycle was measured by flow cytometry. Results: After 96 hours of treatment, genistein inhibited the proliferation of HEECs in a dose-dependent manner. The stimulation index reduced from 100% (without genistein treatment) to about 1% (200 mumol/L genistein). HEECs were arrested at G1/0 and G2/M phase when treated with genistein for 96 hours. When the concentration of genistein was 200 mumol/L, the percentages of HEECs at G1/0, G2/M, and S phase were 96.0%, 2.1%, and 1.9%, respectively. However, when HEECs were treated without genistein, the percentages of HEECs at G1/0, G2/M, and S phase were 76.7%, 8.5%, and 14.7%, respectively. 17beta-E2 could not influence the effects of genistein on the proliferation of HEECs. Meanwhile, genistein could suppress the proliferation of HEC-1B. If the stimulation index of HEC-1B was defined as 100% when HEC-1B was treated with different doses of 17beta-E2 (without genistein), it was 67%, 19%, as well as 32% when cell was supplemented with 200 mumol/L genistein combined wim 0, 0.2, or 1 nmol/L 17beta-E2, respectively. Conclusion: Genistein at the concentration of 200 mumol/L can sufficiently inhibit the proliferation of HEECs and endometrial glandular epithelium simultaneously in vitro.",NA,"angiogenesis article cancer cell cell culture cell cycle cell cycle G1 phase cell cycle G2 phase cell cycle M phase *cell proliferation concentration response controlled study drug effect endometrium cancer *endometrium cell flow cytometry human human cell in vitro study inhibition kinetics measurement antimitotic agent *genistein tritium","49-53","23","2008",-1

Shu","UGT1A1 genetic polymorphisms, endogenous estrogen exposure, soy food intake, and endometrial cancer risk","Estrogen exposures play a critical role in the development of endometrial cancer. Genetic variation in the estrogen metabolism UGT1A1 gene may modify the effect of estrogenic exposures on endometrial cancer risk. We tested this hypothesis in a population-based case-control study of 1,047 endometrial cancer cases and 1,035 controls who completed an in-person interview and were genotyped for the UGT1A1 polymorphisms rs2070959 (A/G), rs887829 (G/A), and rs8175347 (6/7 TA repeats). Estrogen exposure-related factors evaluated include menstrual characteristics, oral contraceptive use, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, and soy food intake. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The homozygote variant genotype (G/G) of the rs2070959 polymorphism was significantly associated with a reduced risk of endometrial cancer (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8). No significant associations between endometrial cancer risk and genotype were seen for the rs887829 and rs8175347 polymorphisms. Analysis of the joint effects of genotype and markers of estrogen exposure found the lowest risk of endometrial cancer among those with the homozygous variant genotype of the rs2070959 polymorphism and who were postmenopausal, had low body mass index, and had low soy food intake, although a test for multiplicative interaction was not significant. Taken together, these data suggest that the G/G genotype (rs2070959) in the UGT1A1 gene may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer and that this effect is most evident among women with low levels of endogenous estrogen exposure or with low soy food intake.

"1495","1410"," X. Qiao, K. R. McConnell, R. A. Khalil","Sex steroids and vascular responses in hypertension and aging","Background: Sex hormones play a significant role in human physiology. Estrogen may have protective effects in the cardiovascular system, as evidenced by the decreased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in premenopausal compared with postmenopausal women. Objective: This review highlights the acute and long-term effects of sex hormones on the vascular endothelium and vascular smooth muscle (VSM) in adults. Changes in the sex hormone mix, their receptors, and their effects on vascular function in hypertension and aging are also discussed. Methods: Literature collected from the National Centers for Biotechnology Information as identified by a PubMed database search, as well as our experimental work, was used to highlight current knowledge regarding vascular responses to sex hormones in hypertension and in aging. Results: Experiments in adult female animals have shown that estrogen induces endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation via the nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin, and hyperpolarization pathways. Also, surface membrane estrogen receptors (ERs) decrease intracellular free Ca2+ concentration and perhaps protein kinase C-dependent VSM contraction. However, clinical trials such as the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), HERS-II, and the Women's Health Initiative did not support the experimental findings and demonstrated adverse cardiovascular events of hormone therapy (HT) in aging women. The lack of vascular benefits of HT may be related to the hormone used, the ER, or the patient's cardiovascular condition or age. Experiments on vascular strips from aging (16-month-old) female spontaneously hypertensive rats have shown reduced ER-mediated NO production from endothelial cells and decreased inhibitory effects of estrogen on Ca2+ entry mechanisms of VSM contraction. The age-related decrease in ER-mediated vascular relaxation may explain the decreased effectiveness of HT on CVD in aging women. Conclusions: New HT strategies should further examine the benefits of natural estrogens and phytoestrogens. Transdermal estrogen may be more effective than the oral form, and specific ER modulators may maximize the vascular benefits and reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer. Variants of vascular ERs should be screened for genetic polymorphisms and postmenopausal decrease in the amount of downstream signaling mechanisms. HT may be more effective during the menopausal transition than in late menopause. Progesterone, testosterone, or their specific modulators may be combined with estrogen to provide alternative HT strategies. Thus, HT type, dose, route of administration, and timing should be customized, depending on the patient's cardiovascular condition and age, thereby enhancing the vascular benefits of HT in aging women. 2008 Excerpta Medica Inc.",NA,"*aging article atherosclerosis *blood vessel reactivity breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/si [Side Effect] breast tenderness/si [Side Effect] calcium transport cardiovascular disease/si [Side Effect] clinical trial combination chemotherapy drug absorption drug dose comparison endothelium cell genetic polymorphism hormonal therapy human hyperpolarization *hypertension low drug dose Medline monotherapy nonhuman postmenopause priority journal progesterone blood level risk reduction signal transduction spontaneously hypertensive rat testosterone blood level vagina bleeding/si [Side Effect] vascular endothelium vascular smooth muscle vasodilatation venous thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] C reactive protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] calcium ion/ec [Endogenous Compound] conjugated estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] conjugated estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] conjugated estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] conjugated estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] conjugated estrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] conjugated estrogen/pk [Pharmacokinetics] daidzein equol estradiol/ct [Clinical Trial] estradiol/cb [Drug Combination] estradiol/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] estrogen/ad [Drug Administration] estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] estrogen/va [Intravaginal Drug Administration] estrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] estrogen/pk [Pharmacokinetics] estrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] estrogen derivative/tp [Topical Drug Administration] estrogen derivative/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein gestagen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] gestagen/ct [Clinical Trial] gestagen/cb [Drug Combination] gestagen/cm [Drug Comparison] hormone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] hormone/do [Drug Dose] hormone/po [Oral Drug Administration] hormone/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] hormone receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] idoxifene medroxyprogesterone acetate/ct [Clinical Trial] medroxyprogesterone acetate/cb [Drug Combination] medroxyprogesterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] medroxyprogesterone acetate/po [Oral Drug Administration] nitric oxide/ec [Endogenous Compound] phytoestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] prasterone progesterone/cb [Drug Combination] progesterone/po [Oral Drug Administration] prostacyclin/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase C/ec [Endogenous Compound] raloxifene/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] raloxifene/ct [Clinical Trial] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator *sex hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] tamoxifen testosterone/cb [Drug Combination]","S46-S64","5","2008",-1

A study was completed to determine if men with active prostate cancer will adhere to a dietary intervention rich in tomato products and a soy protein supplement men (n = 41) with recurrent, asymptomatic prostate cancer were randomized among 2 groups: Group A (n = 20) consumed tomato products (no soy) for Weeks 0 through 4, targeting a minimum of 25 mg of lycopene/day. Group B (n = 21) consumed soy (no tomatoes) for Weeks 0 through 4, providing 40 g of soy protein/day. For Weeks 4 through 8, all men consumed a combined tomato-rich diet and soy supplements. No grade II through IV toxicities were observed. During Weeks 0 through 4, mean daily lycopene intake for Group A was 43 mg (+ 15 mg) and mean soy intake for Group B was 39 g (+ 1 g), remaining similar during Weeks 4 through 8. Serum lycopene increased from 0.72 + 0.09 mumol/l to 1.21 + 0.10 mumol/l (P < 0.0001) and urinary isoflavone excretion increased from not detectable to 54.1 + 5.7 mumol/l (P < 0.05) with 8 wk of diet intervention. Serum prostate-specific antigen decreased between Weeks 0 and 8 for 14 / 41 men (34%). Mean serum vascular endothelial growth factor for the entire group was reduced from 87 to 51 ng/ml (P < 0.05) over 8 wk. In conclusion, prostate cancer patients will consume diets rich in tomato products and soy with excellent compliance and bioavailability of phytochemicals. Further studies combining tomato and soy foods to determine efficacy for prostate cancer prevention or management are encouraged.

"1503","1420"," K. M. Crofton","Thyroid disrupting chemicals: Mechanisms and mixtures","Environmental contaminants are known to act as thyroid disrupting chemicals (TDCs). Broadly defined, TDCs are xenobiotics that alter the structure or function of the thyroid gland, alter regulatory enzymes associated with thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis or change circulating or tissue concentrations of THs. For THs, homeostasis is defined as the normal range of THs and TSH in circulation and tissues. TDCs include a wide range chemical structures that act through a variety of mechanisms. Concern about TDCs has increased because of the critical role that thyroid hormones play in brain development. A major uncertainty regarding the endocrine disrupting potential of environmental xenobiotics is the potential for additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects following exposure to mixtures. In addition, there are a number of uncertainties in both interpretation and extrapolation of results from studies of TDC mixtures. Extrapolation of data from laboratory animals to humans is tempered by uncertainty in how the mechanism(s)-of-action of the TDCs may differ between species. The variety of mechanisms by which TDCs alter thyroid homeostasis also yields a difficulty in determining at what level of biological organization to cumulate effects. Should it be at the molecular level, which could be chemical class specific or at the level of a downstream consequence (e.g. circulating hormone levels, brain biochemistry and behaviour) which would be mechanism-independent? To date, the limited data from TDC mixture studies suggest that dose addition is reasonably accurate in predicting the effects on serum T4 concentrations. Assessing the health risks of thyroid disruption by environmental xenobiotics will need to include an improved understanding of how divergent mechanisms alter THs and consequent adverse impacts on nervous system development.",NA,"biliary excretion brain development conference paper health hazard homeostasis human priority journal protein function thyroid gland 1 methyl 3 propyl imidazole 2 thione 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol acetochlor benzophenone 2 *bromate *chlorate emd 49209 endocrine disruptor glucuronosyltransferase 1A1/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone mancozeb oltipraz pentachlorophenol *perchlorate phenobarbital polychlorinated biphenyl polychlorinated dibenzodioxin polychlorinated dibenzofuran *propylthiourea sulfotransferase 1A1/ec [Endogenous Compound] *thiamazole thyroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] triclosan unclassified drug *xenobiotic agent","209-222","31","2008",-1

Methods: A total of 20 men (mean age 65 years) were treated with a daily 60-mg dose of an isoflavone extract for 1 year. Liver function, sexual hormone levels (total testosterone, estrogen, luteotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), transrectal ultrasonography volumetry of the prostate, PSA level, International Prostate Symptom Score, and International Index of Erectile Function score were recorded at the beginning of the study and every 3 months for 1 year. Results: The average PSA level was 10.16 ng/mL at baseline versus 7.15 ng/mL after 12 months, for a statistically significant reduction of 33% (P <0.019). The mean prostate volume had decreased slightly from 49.3 cm3 to 44.3 cm3 after 12 months (P <0.097). The sexual hormone levels did not change throughout the study. We registered a significant increase in all three liver transaminases after 3 months (P <0.001). The International Prostate Symptom Score showed a mean value of 7.9 at baseline and 6.68 after 12 months (P <0.421). Sexual function was not influenced by the treatment. Conclusions: Daily oral administration of 60 mg of an isoflavone extract was well tolerated and caused no side effects. The significant increase in liver transaminases and the significant decrease in total PSA levels by >30% indicates that patients, general practitioners, and urologists should be informed about these potential effects of red clover extracts and possibly other phytoestrogens, on liver transaminases and elevated total PSA levels. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

"1507","1424"," H. D. Nelson","Menopause","Menopause is the time of life when menstrual cycles cease, and is caused by reduced secretion of the ovarian hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Although menopause is a normal event for women, individual experiences vary, and some women seek medical advice for the management of symptoms. Many symptoms have been attributed to menopause, but only vasomotor dysfunction and vaginal dryness are consistently associated with this time of life in epidemiological studies. Other common symptoms such as mood changes, sleep disturbances, urinary incontinence, cognitive changes, somatic complaints, sexual dysfunction, and reduced quality of life may be secondary to other symptoms, or related to other causes. Trials of therapies for vasomotor dysfunction have shown improvements with oestrogen, gabapentin, paroxetine, and clonidine, but little or no benefit with other agents; adverse effects of these treatments must also be considered.

Tony Kong","Anticarcinogenesis by dietary phytochemicals: Cytoprotection by Nrf2 in normal cells and cytotoxicity by modulation of transcription factors NF-B and AP-1 in abnormal cancer cells","Cancer statistics from the American Cancer Society and other sources are a stark reminder of our failure to combat this deadly disease. Chemoprevention entails the use of specific naturally occurring dietary or synthetic agents to thwart cancer development and progression. Some of these agents are believed to do so by protecting the cells or tissues from the malicious attack of exogenous carcinogens and/or endogenous reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) by inducing several detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes that appear to form stable conjugates such as glutathione, glucuronides or sulfates thus rendering the carcinogenic species harmless. This process of inducing the cellular defense enzymes is believed to be mediated by the antioxidant response elements (ARE) within the promoter regions of these genes. Nrf2, a redox sensitive transcription factor has been documented to play a central role in ARE-driven gene expression. Nrf2, under normal unstimulated conditions, remains sequestered in the cytosol by Keap1. The putative chemopreventive agents disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1 association, thereby releasing Nrf2 which then translocates to the nucleus and drives the gene expression of detoxifying enzymes. The role of other transcription factors such as NF-B and AP-1 in carcinogenesis is well established. By modulating the activity of these transcription factors and their upstream signaling molecules, naturally occurring dietary phytochemicals appear to cause apoptosis in abnormal cells that over-express these factors, thereby inhibiting the promotion and progression. This review discusses the most current and up to date understanding of the possible signaling mechanisms by which these naturally dietary phytochemicals can differentially modulate signal transduction cascades such that they can bring about apoptosis/cell death in abnormal cancer cells but at the same time induce defensive enzymes to protect against carcinogenesis in normal cells. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), epidermal growth factor receptor, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) were assessed in baseline and ending prostate biopsy cores. Serum collected at 0, 3, and 6 mo was analyzed for total and free prostate specific antigen (PSA). Consumption of SPI+ did not alter any of the prostate cancer tumor markers. Bax expression decreased from baseline in the SPI- group, resulting in lower Bax expression than the MPI group. PCNA expression also decreased from baseline in the SPI- group, but this was not different from the other 2 groups. PSA did not differ among the groups at 3 or 6 mo. Interestingly, a lower rate of prostate cancer developed in the soy groups compared to the milk group (P = 0.01). These data suggest that 6-mo SPI+ consumption does not alter prostate tissue biomarkers, SPI- consumption exerts mixed effects, and less prostate cancer is detected after 6 mo of soy consumption regardless of isoflavone content.

Mukhtar","Prevention of prostate cancer through custom tailoring of chemopreventive regimen","One practical way to control cancer is through chemoprevention, which refers to the administration of synthetic or naturally occurring agents to block, reverse or delay the process of carcinogenesis. For a variety of reasons, the most important of which is human acceptance, for chemopreventive intervention naturally occurring diet-based agents are preferred over synthetic agents. For a long time, the prevailing mantra of cancer chemoprevention has been: ""Find effective agents with acceptable or no toxicity and use them in preventing cancer in relatively healthy people or individuals at high risk for developing cancer"". In pursuing this goal many naturally occurring phytochemicals capable of affording protection against carcinogenesis in preclinical settings in experimental animals have been described. However, clinical trials of single agents have yielded disappointing results. Since carcinogenesis is a multistage phenomenon in which many normal cellular pathways become aberrant, it is unlikely that one agent could prove effective in preventing cancer. This review underscores the need to build an armamentarium of naturally occurring chemopreventive substances that could prevent or slow down the development and progression of prostate cancer. Thus, the new effective approach for cancer prevention ""building a customized mechanism-based chemoprevention cocktail of naturally occurring substances"" is advocated. 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Throughout gestation and post-natal development, females were exposed to a regular diet or a nutritionally similar diet deficient in phyto-oestrogens. After segregation at weaning on the basis of short or long AGDI, an indirect measure of in utero androgen exposure, females were housed alone or underneath two outbred adult males for 2 weeks. Female urinary samples were collected non-invasively throughout this exposure, then assayed for oestradiol, progesterone and creatinine. Females were then killed and uterine and ovarian mass was determined. Urinary oestradiol was substantially reduced in females raised on the phyto-oestrogen-free diet. Oestradiol levels were more dynamic over days in urine of male-exposed females, especially among those on the regular diet. Urinary progesterone was not strongly influenced by diet. Progesterone was more dynamic in urine of male-exposed females, and was generally elevated compared with levels in isolated females, the size of this effect dependent on AGDI, diet and whether the measure was adjusted for creatinine. Urinary creatinine was elevated by the phyto-oestrogen-free diet and reduced by male exposure, tending to decline over days in females exposed to males. Male exposure increased uterine and ovarian mass and was influenced by AGDI in interaction with diet and male exposure. 2008 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.",NA,"animal experiment anogenital distance article controlled study creatinine urine level diet female female genital tract parameters mouse nonhuman organ weight ovary weight priority journal puberty sexual behavior *sexual maturation steroid urine level uterus weight creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen progesterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] *steroid","99-106","135","2008",-1

Mushroom intake was measured via a food frequency questionnaire that was administered by well-trained interviewers. The associations between the daily intake and the average consumption frequency of mushrooms with breast cancer risk were evaluated using matched data analysis. Both the daily intake (5th vs. 1st quintile, OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.30-0.78, p for trend 0.030) and the average consumption frequency of mushrooms (4th vs. 1st quartile, OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.35-0.82, p for trend 0.008) were inversely associated with breast cancer risk after adjustment for education, family history of breast cancer, regular exercise [>22.5 MET (metabolic equivalent)-hr/week], BMI (body mass index, Kg/m2), number of children and whether they are currently smoking, drinking or using multivitamin supplements. Further adjustments were made for energy-adjusted carbohydrate, soy protein, folate and vitamin E levels, which tended to attenuate these results. After a stratification was performed according to menopausal status, a strong inverse association was found in postmenopausal women (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.04-0.54, p for trend = 0.0058 for daily intake; OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.05-0.54, p for trend = 0.0037 for average frequency), but not in premenopausal women.

Leung","The red clover (Trifolium pratense) isoflavone biochanin A inhibits aromatase activity and expression","Biochanin A is an isoflavone isolated from red clover (Trifolium pratense), and is a commercially available nutraceutical for women suffering from postmenopausal symptoms. Isoflavones resemble the structure of oestrogen, and display agonistic and antagonistic interactions with the oestrogen receptor. Overexposure of oestrogen is a major contributing factor in the development of breast cancer, and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 19 enzyme, or aromatase, catalyses the reaction converting androgen to oestrogen. In the present study the effect of biochanin A on the gene regulation and enzyme activity of aromatase was investigated. By assaying MCF-7 cells stably transfected with CYP19, biochanin A inhibited aromatase activity and hampered cell growth attributing to the enzyme activity. In addition, 25 mum-biochanin A significantly reduced CYP19 mRNA abundance in the oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells SK-BR-3. The transcriptional control of the CYP19 gene is exon-specific, and promoter regions I.3 and II have been shown to be responsible for CYP19 expression in SK-BR-3 cells. Luciferase reporter gene assays also revealed that biochanin A could repress the transcriptional control dictated by the promoter regulation. Interestingly, genistein did not inhibit aromatase but it might down regulate promoter I.3 and II transactivation. Since genistein is a major metabolite of biochanin A, it might contribute to biochanin A's suppressive effect on CYP19 expression. The present study illustrated that biochanin A inhibited CYP19 activity and gene expression. 2007 The Authors.",NA,"article breast cancer cell strain MCF 7 controlled study drug effect enzyme activity enzyme inhibition enzyme repression gene control gene expression regulation gene interaction gene repression human human cell promoter region protein expression protein localization red clover transcription regulation *aromatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein isoflavone luciferase messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]","303-310","99","2008",-1

Xie","Decreased expression of aromatase in the Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells by the isoflavone, puerarin, is associated with inhibition of c-jun expression and AP-1 activity","Aromatase P450 (P450arom) is overexpressed in endometriosis, endometrial cancers and uterine fibroids. With weak estrogen agonists/antagonists and some other enzymatic activities, isoflavones are increasingly advocated as a natural alternative to estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) and are available as dietary supplements. Puerarin is major isoflavonoid compound isolated from Pueraria lobata, a Chinese medicine known as Gegen. Our clinical study shows that puerarin can be used in the treatment of endometriosis, which improves pain and infertility. Assuming that the effect of puerarin on endometriosis may result from the regulation of aromatase expression or activity, we carried out this study to test the effects of puerarin on aromatase in Ishikawa and RL95-2 cell lines. Our data have demonstrated a significant decrease of P450arom expression at both mRNA and protein levels by low dose puerarin treatment in both cell lines. Besides, we found that the -410/-401 bp and -565/-559 bp regions of aromatase promoter II contained the critical cis-acting elements, binding AP-1 and c-jun. We also found that puerarin exerted a time-course effect on the inhibition of c-jun mRNA, which parallelled that of P450arom. To further confirm if c-jun is responsible for the P450arom regulation by puerarin, we knocked down c-jun expression using siRNA and it indicates that c-jun acts as a considerable transcription factor in regulating P450arom expression and activity. Accordingly, the suppression of P450arom expression and activity by puerarin treatment may associate with the downregulation of transcription factor AP-1 or c-jun. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We applied a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor-based screening method for the fast screening of chemicals with thyroxine (T4) transport disrupting activity. Two inhibition assays using the main thyroid hormone transport proteins, T4 binding globulin (TBG) and transthyretin (TTR), in combination with a T4-coated biosensor chip were optimized and automated for screening chemical libraries. The transport protein-based biosensor assays were rapid, high throughput and bioeffect-related. A library of 62 chemicals including the natural hormones, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) and metabolites, halogenated bisphenol A (BPA), halogenated phenols, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and other potential environmentally relevant chemicals was tested with the two assays. We discovered ten new active compounds with moderate to high affinity for TBG with the TBG assay. Strikingly, the most potent binding was observed with hydroxylated metabolites of the brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) BDE 47, BDE 49 and BDE 99, that are commonly found in human plasma. The TTR assay confirmed the activity of previously identified hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs and PBDEs, halogenated BPA and genistein. These results show that the hydroxylated metabolites of the ubiquitous PBDEs not only target the T4 transport at the TTR level, but also, and to a great extent, at the TBG level where most of the T4 in humans is circulating. The optimized SPR biosensor-based transport protein assay is a suitable method for high throughput screening of large libraries for potential thyroid hormone disrupting compounds. 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Following the discovery of BCRP in 1998 an increasing number of substances were studied in relation to their potency to interact with this transporter. Recently it has been shown that XR9576 inhibits both P-gp and BCRP transport function similarly to GF120918 (elacridar). This observation prompted us to investigate 5 XR compounds and 25 structurally related derivatives synthesized in our laboratory for their BCRP inhibitory effect. The biological activity data were determined by our new Hoechst 33342 assay that has been transferred from P-gp to BCRP overexpressing cells. 3D-QSAR models (CoMFA and CoMSIA) were generated and validated by the leave-many-out method and the scrambling stability test. The best models yielded an internal predictive squared correlation coefficient higher than 0.8 and contained steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond donor fields. To our knowledge, this is the first 3D-QSAR analysis of BCRP inhibitors. Additionally the biological activity data determined in P-gp overexpressing cells on one side and BCRP overexpressing cells on the other side were compared to identify selective and non-selective inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP.

Equol exhibits a stronger estrogenic activity than daidzein, however, only approximately 30% of the population has been identified as equol-producers and there are too few direct evidences of the effects of the other major metabolite, O-DMA on estrogen-deficient status. The purpose of this study is therefore, to compare the effect of both O-DMA and equol on bone and lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro. For the in vivo study, 8-week-old female mice were assigned to five groups as follows: sham-operated (sham), ovariectomized (OVX), OVX + 0.5 mg/day O-DMA (OVX + O-DMA), OVX + 0.5 mg/day equol (OVX + Eq), and OVX + 0.03 mug/day 17beta-estradiol (OVX + E2) administration. Three weeks after the intervention, O-DMA and equol did not affect uterine atrophy in OVX mice. The bone mineral density (BMD) of the femur was lower in the OVX group than in the sham group. The administration of equol but not O-DMA, maintained BMD through the intervention. Values of whole body fat mass and plasma lipids were lower in the equol and O-DMA treated OVX mice than those in OVX mice. In the in vitro study, equol significantly inhibited the osteoclast formation induced by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 in a dose-dependent manner in a co-culture system of mouse bone-marrow cells with primary osteoblastic cells. However, O-DMA slightly inhibited osteoclast formation, and the effect was not dose dependent. These results suggest that the effects of O-DMA on bone and lipid metabolism in OVX mice and osteoclast cell cultures are weaker than those of equol. 2008 Spinger.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article body fat *bone density bone marrow cell bone marrow culture *cell culture coculture concentration response controlled study drug activity female femur in vitro study in vivo study lipid blood level *lipid metabolism mouse nonhuman osteoblast *osteoclast *ovariectomy sham procedure uterus atrophy uterus disease uterus weight calcitriol *daidzein *equol/cm [Drug Comparison] *equol/pd [Pharmacology] *equol/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] estradiol *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone derivative/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] *lipid/ec [Endogenous Compound] *o desmethylangolensin/cm [Drug Comparison] *o desmethylangolensin/pd [Pharmacology] *o desmethylangolensin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration]","273-279","47","2008",1

Approximately one fourth to one third of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer reported complementary and alternative medicine use, and many of these patients are taking a supplement called ""Dr. Donsbach's Prostasol."". Methods: We discuss the cases of 2 patients with prostate cancer who were taking Dr. Donsbach's Prostasol and developed venous thromboembolic events while taking this supplement, in the absence of other obvious risk factors. We review these 2 cases and the time-line for the development of the venous thromboembolic events and use of Dr. Donsbach's Prostasol. We compared Prostasol with PC-SPES, a similar supplement that was associated with thrombosis and was ultimately taken off the market because of patient safety concerns. Results: Prostasol contains phytoestrogens that could result in both the suppression of testosterone and the predisposition to thrombosis. Both patients had suppression of their testosterone to castrate levels with an associated decrease in prostate-specific antigen at the time of their thrombotic event. Conclusions: These cases are suggestive of an association between Prostasol use and venous thromboembolic events. Physicians should be aware of the use of this agent in their patients, although it is not known whether it would be appropriate to prescribe prophylactic low-dose warfarin therapy.

The objective of the present study was to analyse risk factors for onset of menopausal symptoms. Methods: Analyses were based on the 28,118 women participating in the French E3N cohort study who reached menopause between 1990 and 2000. Questionnaires were sent every 2 years, and specifically enquired about use of hormonal treatments, reproductive factors, smoking status, anthropometric measurements, dietary habits and personal medical history, including onset of menopausal symptoms. Hazard ratios were computed from multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with age as the time-scale. Results: The risk of onset of menopausal symptoms was negatively associated with education level and with some hormonal and reproductive factors (usual duration of menstrual cycles, parity and current use of oral contraceptives). A decrease in risk was found in those with underweight, overweight and obesity, but only in post-menopause. The risk was positively associated with smoking and alcohol consumption; it was also positively related to certain frequent medical conditions (depression, migraine, benign thyroid disease, atopy), possibly due to underlying common mechanisms such as the influence of vaso-active substances. Among dietary factors, rapidly absorbed sugars and snacking were positively associated with the risk of onset of menopausal symptoms. Conclusions: Onset of menopausal symptoms seems to be affected by various reproductive, hormonal and environmental factors. Some of them are modifiable, which may allow suggesting recommendations. 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Saha","Pharmacophore mapping of flavone derivatives for aromatase inhibition","Aromatase, which catalyses the final step in the steroidogenesis pathway of estrogen, has been target for the design of inhibitor in the treatment of hormone dependent breast cancer for postmenopausal women. The extensive SAR studies performed in the last 30 years to search for potent, selective and less toxic compounds, have led to the development of second and third generation of non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (AI). Besides the development of synthetic compounds, several naturally occurring and synthetic flavonoids, which are ubiquitous natural phenolic compounds and mediate the host of biological activities, are found to demonstrate inhibitory effects on aromatase. The present study explores the pharmacophores, i.e., the structural requirements of flavones (Fig. 1) for inhibition of aromatase activity, using quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and space modeling approaches. The classical QSAR studies generate the model (R 2 = 0.924, Q 2 = 0.895, s = 0.233) that shows the importance of aromatic rings A and C, along with substitutional requirements in meta and para positions of ring C for the activity. 3D QSAR of Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA, R 2 = 0.996, R cv2 = 0.791) and Comparative Molecular Similarity Analysis (CoMSIA, R 2 = 0.992, R cv2 = 0.806) studies show contour maps of steric and hydrophobic properties and contribution of acceptor and donor of the molecule, suggesting the presence of steric hindrance due to ring C and R-substituent, bulky hydrophobic substitution in ring A, along with acceptors at positions 11, and alpha and of imidazole ring, and donor in ring C favor the inhibitory activity. Further space modeling (CATALYST) study (R = 0.941, cost = 96.96, rmsd = 0.876) adjudge the presence of hydrogen bond acceptor (keto functional group), hydrophobic (ring A) and aromatic rings (steric hindrance) along with critical distance among features are important for the inhibitory activity. 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",NA,"article comparative molecular field analysis drug activity drug inhibition enzyme activity enzyme inhibition pharmacophore priority journal stereospecificity structure activity relation substitution reaction 4 [4 methyl 2 [4 [2 (1 piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl] 7 pivaloyloxy 2h 1 benzopyran 3 ylphenyl] pivalate/pd [Pharmacology] aromatase bazedoxifene/pd [Pharmacology] cyclofenil/pd [Pharmacology] ephedrine/pd [Pharmacology] *flavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] gefitinib/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxytamoxifene/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxytoremifene/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxytrioxifene/pd [Pharmacology] idoxifene/pd [Pharmacology] imidazole lasofoxifene/pd [Pharmacology] letrozole/pd [Pharmacology] nafoxidine/pd [Pharmacology] norgestrel/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] simvastatin/pd [Pharmacology] stanozolol/pd [Pharmacology] tamoxifen derivative/pd [Pharmacology] tangeretin/pd [Pharmacology] testosterone/pd [Pharmacology] tetrahydroisoquinoline/ec [Endogenous Compound] toremifene/pd [Pharmacology] trioxifene/pd [Pharmacology]","65-76","12","2008",-1

Arterburn","GPR30: a novel therapeutic target in estrogen-related disease","Estrogen is a crucial hormone in human physiology that regulates a multitude of biological processes. It is also an important target in many diseases such as cancer and skeletal, neurological and immunological conditions. The actions of estrogen have traditionally been ascribed to one of two closely related classical nuclear hormone receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta, which are best characterized for regulating gene expression. Recent studies have revealed the contribution of a novel estrogen receptor GPR30, which belongs to the family of seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors, to many of the rapid biological responses to estrogen. Many drugs, such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant, which seem to selectively inhibit the activities of the classical estrogen receptors, are in widespread clinical use. However, recent results indicate that these same drugs activate multiple cellular-signaling pathways via GPR30. Unraveling the pharmacological profiles and specificities of ERalpha, ERbeta and GPR30 will be vital for understanding not only the physiological roles of each receptor but also for the development of the next generation of receptor-specific drugs. 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients and methods: The research was carried out on initial sample of 468 female Municipal Police employees (209 traffic police and 259 controls). After excluding the principal confounding factors, traffic police were matched with controls by age, working life, menstrual cycle day, BMI, drinking habit, cigarette smoking habit, liquorice and soy intake in diet, habitual consumption of Italian coffee. There were 96 female traffic police and 96 controls included in the study. Results: T mean levels were significantly higher in female traffic police compared to controls (p = 0.000). The distribution of T values in traffic police and in controls was significant (p = 0.000). No significant differences were found comparing the percentage in traffic police and controls concerning dystocial, premature and post-term birth. An increase in mental health disorders was found in traffic police compared to controls but the difference was not significant. Conclusion: The increase in T plasma levels observed in traffic police vs. controls can be due to a chronic working exposure to low doses of environmental chemical urban stressor. According to our previous researches T could be used as an early biological marker even before the onset of the related disorders. 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Female mice were inoculated per vaginam with Tritrichomonas foetus and a sample of the study population was killed every 3 days up to 60 days post-infection. Microscopical changes in the reproductive organs were assessed and immunohistochemistry was used to detect T. foetus within these tissues. Lectin histochemistry was used to determine changes in the expression of carbohydrates within the reproductive mucosa. A range of microscopical changes were detected in the uterine endometrium by 10 days post-inoculation and these were associated with the presence of the protozoan. The endometrial changes included endometritis and ulceration, mucosal atrophy and glandular metaplasia, and were similar to those reported in naturally infected cows. Changes in lectin binding were recognized first in the vagina where there was increased binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1 (UEA-1) which was maximal on day 16 post-inoculation. Within the uterus, there was increased binding of soy bean agglutinin (SBA) which was maximal on day 19 post-inoculation, and of peanut agglutinin (PNA) which was maximal on day 16 post-inoculation. These changes in carbohydrate expression parallel the infection kinetics, since they appeared first in the vagina and later in the uterus. The changes may reflect either a host reaction against the infection or the production of enzymes by T. foetus, which act to enhance adhesion and colonization of the genital organs by the organism. The kinetics and pathogenesis of this murine infection are similar to those of the natural bovine disease, suggesting that this model system may be valuable for further studies of this disease. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Iron, an essential micronutrient with pro-oxidant properties, has received little attention, and specific fats may augment its toxicity. We investigated the effects of iron and fats from various food sources on the risk of breast cancer. Methods: Participants in a population-based case-control study, 3,452 breast cancer cases, and 3,474 age-frequency-matched controls, completed in-person interviews, including a detailed food-frequency questionnaire. Plant- and animal-derived iron and fat intakes were derived from dietary intake data and food composition tables. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to study the independent and interactive effects of different forms of iron and fats on breast cancer risk. Results: Animal-derived (largely heme) iron intake was positively associated with breast cancer risk (P trend < 0.01; OR = 1.49 in the highest vs. lowest quartile, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.78) after adjustment for known risk factors, antioxidant vitamin and isoflavone intake, and vitamin supplement use. The effect of animal-derived iron was similar in pre- and postmenopausal women. Intake of animal-derived fats was also associated with increased risk (adjusted OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.14-1.58), particularly after menopause. A significant interaction between iron and fat from animal sources was observed (P < 0.01). Conclusions: A high intake of animal-derived (heme) iron may be associated with an increased risk of primary breast cancer in Chinese women, and saturated and mono-unsaturated fats that are also derived from animal sources may augment this effect. Combined reductions in animal-derived iron and fat consumption have the potential to reduce breast cancer risk. 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",NA,"adult animal article *breast cancer/et [Etiology] cancer risk case control study Chinese confidence interval controlled study *fat intake female food composition food intake human interview *iron intake logistic regression analysis major clinical study population research priority journal statistical model statistical significance vitamin supplementation antioxidant *fat/to [Drug Toxicity] heme *iron/to [Drug Toxicity] isoflavone","123-132","107","2008",-1
"1547","1490"," A. Monnier","Clinical management of adverse events in adjuvant therapy for hormone-responsive early breast cancer","Systemic adjuvant therapy has proven highly effective at reducing recurrences and deaths in patients who have received primary therapy for early breast cancer. However, as with all treatments, adjuvant therapy can cause unwanted side effects, and effective management of these events is essential to ensure that patients comply with, and continue, treatment. Adjuvant endocrine therapy is not associated with the more severe, acute toxicities of chemotherapy, and can therefore be taken for many years. At present, the standard duration of postoperative adjuvant endocrine therapy is 5 years. Prevention and treatment of adverse events associated with long-term endocrine therapy is particularly important in the adjuvant setting, where patients are clinically cancer free. In this situation, the efficacy benefits are not, therefore, obvious to the patient, but side effects may have a negative impact on daily life. Tamoxifen has been the gold standard endocrine therapy for hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer for many years, and the long-term side effects of this agent are well documented. In recent years, the aromatase inhibitors (AIs) have begun to displace tamoxifen as the adjuvant therapy of choice, owing to greater efficacy and good tolerability. Predictably, the AIs and tamoxifen have partially overlapping side-effect profiles. Both therapies are associated with typical symptoms of estrogen deprivation; however, tamoxifen also has estrogenic activity in some tissues, which can cause either detrimental (genital tract) or beneficial (bone, cardiovascular system, lipids) effects that are not associated with AI use. To reduce treatment discontinuations, it is important that patients are made aware of the possible side effects of adjuvant therapy and the management strategies available to them, prior to starting therapy. The role of physical, alternative and pharmaceutical therapies in the management of adverse events associated with endocrine therapy has been investigated, and strategies are now available to alleviate symptoms and enable patients to benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy without a significant adverse impact on quality of life. 2007 European Society for Medical Oncology.",NA,"adjuvant therapy arthralgia/dt [Drug Therapy] arthralgia/si [Side Effect] arthralgia/th [Therapy] bone densitometry bone disease/dt [Drug Therapy] bone disease/pc [Prevention] bone disease/th [Therapy] *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *cancer adjuvant therapy *cancer hormone therapy cardiovascular disease clinical trial cognition cognitive defect/si [Side Effect] combination chemotherapy conference paper diet restriction drug choice drug efficacy drug mechanism drug safety drug tolerability dual energy X ray absorptiometry early cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] endometrium cancer/si [Side Effect] estrogen activity estrogen blood level gastrointestinal toxicity/si [Side Effect] genital system disease/si [Side Effect] gynecologic disease/dt [Drug Therapy] gynecologic disease/si [Side Effect] *hormone responsive breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] hormone substitution hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] hot flush/th [Therapy] human hypercholesterolemia/si [Side Effect] libido disorder/si [Side Effect] lifestyle modification lipid blood level low drug dose monotherapy musculoskeletal disease/dt [Drug Therapy] musculoskeletal disease/th [Therapy] myalgia/dt [Drug Therapy] myalgia/si [Side Effect] myalgia/th [Therapy] night sweat/dt [Drug Therapy] night sweat/th [Therapy] osteolysis patient education physiotherapy postmenopause priority journal quality of life risk benefit analysis sexual dysfunction/si [Side Effect] side effect/si [Side Effect] treatment duration treatment planning vagina bleeding/si [Side Effect] vagina discharge/si [Side Effect] vaginal dryness/dt [Drug Therapy] vaginal dryness/si [Side Effect] vasomotor disorder/dt [Drug Therapy] vasomotor disorder/si [Side Effect] vasomotor disorder/th [Therapy] verbal memory alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] anastrozole/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] anastrozole/ct [Clinical Trial] anastrozole/cb [Drug Combination] anastrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] anastrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] Angelica sinensis extract/dt [Drug Therapy] aromatase inhibitor/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] aromatase inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] aromatase inhibitor/cm [Drug Comparison] aromatase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] bisphosphonic acid derivative/po [Oral Drug Administration] calcium/dt [Drug Therapy] Cimicifuga racemosa extract/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/ct [Clinical Trial] clonidine/dt [Drug Therapy] cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/ct [Clinical Trial] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/tp [Topical Drug Administration] estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/tp [Topical Drug Administration] exemestane/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] exemestane/ct [Clinical Trial] exemestane/cm [Drug Comparison] exemestane/dt [Drug Therapy] gabapentin/ct [Clinical Trial] gabapentin/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/ct [Clinical Trial] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] letrozole/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] letrozole/ct [Clinical Trial] letrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] letrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent/dt [Drug Therapy] paracetamol/dt [Drug Therapy] paroxetine/ct [Clinical Trial] paroxetine/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo red clover extract/dt [Drug Therapy] serotonin uptake inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] serotonin uptake inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] tamoxifen/ct [Clinical Trial] tamoxifen/cb [Drug Combination] tamoxifen/cm [Drug Comparison] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] venlafaxine/ct [Clinical Trial] venlafaxine/do [Drug Dose] venlafaxine/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] zoledronic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] zoledronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] zoledronic acid/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration]","viii36-viii44","18","2007",-1

Thomas","Plasma isoflavones and fibrocystic breast conditions and breast cancer among women in Shanghai, China","Background: Proliferative benign breast conditions are associated with elevated risk of breast cancer, whereas nonproliferative conditions are not strongly associated with risk. Factors acting before onset of hyperplasia might be associated with both benign conditions and breast cancer, whereas those on the proliferative disease-to-cancer pathway would be associated only with cancer. Soy isoflavone exposure may influence breast cancer risk, but little is known of its association with benign conditions. Materials and Methods: We examined possible relationships between plasma genistein and daidzein concentrations and risk of breast disease in women, in a breast self-examination trial in Shanghai, China, diagnosed with breast cancer (n = 196) or a benign breast condition (n = 304), and 1,002 age-matched controls with no known breast disease. Benign conditions were classified as nonproliferative (n = 131) or proliferative with or without atypia (n = 173). Results: Isoflavone concentrations were inversely associated with risk of nonproliferative and proliferative benign fibrocystic conditions, as well as with breast cancer, both with and without concomitant proliferative changes in ipsilateral noncancerous mammary epithelium (Ptrend < 0.01 for all comparisons with controls). Women in the highest quartile of plasma genistein (>76.95 ng/mL) were less likely to have breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.50) or benign conditions (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.70) compared with women in the lowest quartile (<9.42 ng/mL). Observed risks for breast cancer with and without surrounding proliferative changes were not different, respectively, from observed risks for benign proliferative and nonproliferative conditions alone. Conclusion: Isoflavone exposure was inversely associated with fibrocystic breast conditions and breast cancer, and the results suggest that effects on cancer risk occur early in carcinogenesis.

Our objective was to determine the effect of quercetin and (-)-epigallocatechin-3- gallate (EGCG), major flavonoids present in the diet, on the PK and bioavailability of biochanin A, a flavonoid with chemopreventive properties. BCA was administered to rats intravenously (5 mg/kg) or orally (16.67 or 50 mg/kg) with or without concomitant EGCG and quercetin. In vitro studies with the human intestinal Caco-2 and human hepatic HepG2 cell lines were performed to evaluate the effects of quercetin and EGCG on the cellular metabolism of BCA, and studies with human breast cancer MCF-7 cells that overexpress P-glycoprotein or BCRP (MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7/MX100 cells, respectively) or MDCK cells that express MRP2 (MDCK-MRP2) were performed to evaluate the effects of cellular efflux. An HPLC assay was used to determine plasma, urine, and cellular concentrations of BCA and the conjugated metabolites of BCA (following enzymatic hydrolysis). The coadministration of quercetin and EGCG significantly increased the BCA area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) in rats, after both iv and oral administration of BCA. The AUC of total BCA (unchanged + conjugated) was also increased. The increases in BCA AUC reflected predominantly increased bioavailability; this was true even after iv administration due to an apparent increase in the enterohepatic cycling of BCA. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the administration of multiple flavonoids results in increased flavonoid bioavailability, as well as a decrease in clearance, potentially due to increased enterohepatic cycling. 2007 American Chemical Society.",NA,"animal experiment area under the curve article cell metabolism cell strain cell strain CACO 2 cell strain HepG2 cell strain MCF 7 chemoprophylaxis controlled study diet supplementation drug bioavailability drug blood level drug effect drug structure high performance liquid chromatography human human cell hydrolysis in vitro study liver circulation male nonhuman priority journal rat urinary excretion *biochanin A/an [Drug Analysis] *biochanin A/cb [Drug Combination] *biochanin A/cr [Drug Concentration] *biochanin A/it [Drug Interaction] *biochanin A/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] *biochanin A/po [Oral Drug Administration] *biochanin A/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] *epigallocatechin gallate/an [Drug Analysis] *epigallocatechin gallate/cb [Drug Combination] *epigallocatechin gallate/it [Drug Interaction] *epigallocatechin gallate/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] *quercetin/an [Drug Analysis] *quercetin/cb [Drug Combination] *quercetin/it [Drug Interaction] *quercetin/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *quercetin/pd [Pharmacology]","865-872","4","2007",-1

The present study aims to investigate how genistein regulates IGF-1 receptor expression in human MCF-7 cells. Genistein at 1mM stimulated the growth of MCF-7 cells and this effect could be completely blocked by the IGF-1 receptor antagonist JB-1, suggesting that IGF-1 receptor is essential for mediating the proliferative effects of genistein in MCF-7 cells. Genistein increased IGF-1 receptor promoter activity. This effect could be completely abolished by co-treatment of MCF-7 cells with ICI 182,780 (10-6 M). Genistein increased IGF-1 receptor gene expression and this effect could be completely blocked by the IGF-1 receptor antagonist JB-1. Co-treatment of MCF-7 cells with cycloheximide (5 mug/ml) completely blocked the induction of IGF-1 receptor protein and mRNA expression by genistein. The results indicated that the induction of IGF-1 receptor promoter activity by genistein required the action of ER while the stimulatory actions of genistein on IGF-1 receptor expression required the activity of the IGF-1 receptor and de novo protein synthesis. These data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the inductive effects of genistein on IGF-1 receptor expression require the cross-talk between IGF-1 receptor and the ER-dependent pathways. 2007 The Authors.",NA,"article *breast cancer/et [Etiology] cancer cell culture cell proliferation cell stimulation cell strain MCF 7 controlled study gene expression human human cell molecular mechanics molecular mimicry promoter region protein expression protein synthesis receptor blocking signal transduction transcription regulation cycloheximide estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] fulvestrant *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] growth inhibitor jb 1 messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *somatomedin C receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","1120-1125","98","2007",-1

Newmark","Mixed tocopherols inhibit N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary tumor growth in rats","Tocopherols are present in significant amounts in vegetable oils used in human foods. The most prevalent tocopherols in foods are the alpha, beta, , and variants with (RRR) stereochemistry. Tocopherols are lipophilic phenolic antioxidants, produced by plants. In the United States, -tocopherol is the most prominent dietary tocopherol due to its high amount in the dominant commercially produced vegetable oils such as soybean, corn, and cottonseed. In this report, experiments were designed to study the inhibitory effect of mixed tocopherols against N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary tumor growth in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Beginning at 21 days of age, rats were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg body weight of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. One wk later, the rats were fed experimental diets containing 0 or 0.1% mixed tocopherols containing over 50% -tocopherol. At 9 wk after N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment, all rats were evaluated for inhibition of mammary tumor growth and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Dietary administration of mixed tocopherols significantly suppressed mammary tumor growth (P < 0.05) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (P < 0.01) and also moderately suppressed tumor multiplicity. The treatment increased the serum levels of - and -tocopherols without affecting the body weight. The results of this study suggest that mixed tocopherols may be safe and effective agents for the prevention of breast cancer.

"1563","1514"," J. Vina, M. C. Gomez-Cabrera, C. Borras","Fostering antioxidant defences: Up-regulation of antioxidant genes or antioxidant supplementation?","Vitamins have traditionally been considered as food components that are required in the normal diet to prevent deficiencies. However, a newer concept of the function of vitamins in nutrition has taken them beyond simply prevention of deficiency symptoms. This concept considers that many vitamins, when taken in relatively larges doses, have important functions beyond preventing deficiencies. Linus Pauling was instrumental in putting forward this concept, particularly for vitamin C. Thus, relatively high intakes of vitamins, and in particular vitamins C and E which are antioxidants, are considered to be healthy for the human population. This may be true in some special situations such as, for instance, the prevention of Alzheimer's disease progression. However, recent epidemiological evidence has not supported the claim that antioxidant vitamins increase well-being and prolong life span. In fact, vitamin supplementation may be even detrimental and reduce life span. A new concept that we would like to put forward is that nutrients up-regulate the endogenous antioxidant defences. This is particularly true in the case of phytoestrogens for example, which bind to oestrogen receptors and eventually up-regulate the expression of antioxidant genes. In this review we discuss the pros and cons of antioxidant vitamin supplementation and also the possibility that the ingestion of some nutrients may be very effective in increasing antioxidant defences by up-regulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes which are normally present in the cell. 2007 The Authors.",NA,"acquired immune deficiency syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] Alzheimer disease/dt [Drug Therapy] Alzheimer disease/pc [Prevention] antioxidant activity beriberi breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer prevention cataract/dt [Drug Therapy] cataract/pc [Prevention] clinical trial common cold/dt [Drug Therapy] common cold/pc [Prevention] conference paper diabetes mellitus/dt [Drug Therapy] diabetes mellitus/pc [Prevention] diarrhea/si [Side Effect] drug carcinogenicity/si [Side Effect] drug megadose drug overdose human immunomodulation iodine deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy] iodine deficiency/pc [Prevention] iron deficiency anemia/dt [Drug Therapy] iron deficiency anemia/pc [Prevention] lipid peroxidation mineral deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy] mineral deficiency/pc [Prevention] muscle injury/pc [Prevention] muscle injury/si [Side Effect] nausea/si [Side Effect] nonhuman *nutritional science nutritional support pellagra preeclampsia/dt [Drug Therapy] preeclampsia/pc [Prevention] respiratory tract infection/dt [Drug Therapy] respiratory tract infection/pc [Prevention] retina macula degeneration/dt [Drug Therapy] retina macula degeneration/pc [Prevention] retinol deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy] retinol deficiency/pc [Prevention] rickets scurvy upregulation vitamin deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin deficiency/pc [Prevention] *vitamin supplementation vomiting/si [Side Effect] alpha tocopherol/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] alpha tocopherol/cb [Drug Combination] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] alpha tocopherol/to [Drug Toxicity] alpha tocopherol/pd [Pharmacology] antiretrovirus agent/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] antiretrovirus agent/dt [Drug Therapy] ascorbic acid/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] ascorbic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] ascorbic acid/cb [Drug Combination] ascorbic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] ascorbic acid/to [Drug Toxicity] ascorbic acid/pd [Pharmacology] beta carotene/cb [Drug Combination] beta carotene/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium estradiol folic acid genistein iodine/dt [Drug Therapy] iron/cb [Drug Combination] iron/dt [Drug Therapy] nicotinic acid phytoestrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo retinol/dt [Drug Therapy] riboflavin selenium thiamine vitamin D zinc","S36-S40","98","2007",-1

The enzymatically derived 81 amino acid tandem repeat domain of Tn-PSM containing ~23 alpha-GalNAc residues binds with ~103-fold enhanced affinity, while the enzymatically derived 38/40 amino acid cleavage product(s) of Tn-PSM containing ~11-12 alpha-GalNAc residues shows ~102-fold enhanced affinity. A natural carbohydrate decorated form of PSM (Fd-PSM) containing 40% of the core 1 blood group type A tetrasaccharide, and 58% peptide-linked GalNAcalpha1-O- Ser/Thr residues, with 45% of the peptide-linked alpha-GalNAc residues linked alpha-(2,6) to N-glycolylneuraminic acid, shows ~104 enhanced affinity for SBA. Vatairea macrocarpa lectin (VML), which is also a GalNAc binding lectin, displays a similar pattern of binding to the four forms of PSM, although there are quantitative differences in its affinities as compared with SBA. The higher affinities of SBA and VML for Tn-PSM relative to Fd-PSM indicate the importance of carbohydrate composition and epitope density of mucins on their affinities for lectins. The higher affinities of SBA and VML for Tn-PSM relative to its two shorter chain analogs demonstrate that the length of a mucin polypeptide and hence total carbohydrate valence determines the affinities of the three Tn-PSM analogs. The results suggest a binding model in which lectin molecules ""bind and jump"" from alpha-GalNAc residue to alpha-GalNAc residue along the polypeptide chain of Tn-PSM before dissociating. The complete thermodynamic binding parameters for these mucins including their binding stoichiometries are presented. The results have important implications for the biological activities of mucins including those expressing the Tn cancer antigen. 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",NA,"article carbohydrate analysis controlled study hemagglutination inhibition isothermal titration calorimetry molecular weight nonhuman priority journal protein binding stoichiometry amino acid derivative epitope mucin n glycoloylneuraminic acid *soybean agglutinin tetrasaccharide *Tn antigen","28256-28263","282","2007",-1

Choi","Effects of a soluble fraction of soybean on lipid profiles in ovariectomized rats fed a cholesterolemic diet","The increases in serum lipid profiles at the onset of menopause are regarded as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to clarify the effects of a dried aqueous soybean extract and ovariectomy on lipid parameters in rats fed with cholesterolemic diet. Twenty-four 9-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups of 12 each and either sham-operated or ovariectomized. The ovariectomized and sham groups were then subdivided into groups of six and fed a semipurified casein-based diet (control diet) or the same diet containing dried soybean extract (0.5%) at the expense of sucrose (experimental diet). Total isoflavone content was 4.52 mg/g of soy extract. Ovariectomized groups showed significantly greater weight gain and food intake than sham groups, while uterus weight was markedly lower in ovariectomized groups. Although ovariectomy significantly increased the concentration of serum triacylglycerol, the concentration of serum total cholesterol was not affected by the operation. Soybean extract restored the concentration of serum triacylglycerol in the ovariectomized groups to the level observed in the sham groups. On the other hand, liver cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the ovariectomized groups compared to the sham group, without effects of the diet. This study suggests that soybean extract supplementation modulates the level of serum triacylglycerol induced by ovariectomy in rats, and furthers the possibility that dietary cholesterol may be a crucial factor in determining liver cholesterol in the presence of ovarian hormone deficiency.

"1571","1529"," G. C. Roman","Autism: Transient in utero hypothyroxinemia related to maternal flavonoid ingestion during pregnancy and to other environmental antithyroid agents","The incidence and prevalence of autism have increased during the past two decades. Despite comprehensive genetic studies the cause of autism remains unknown. This review emphasizes the potential importance of environmental factors in its causation. Alterations of cortical neuronal migration and cerebellar Purkinje cells have been observed in autism. Neuronal migration, via reelin regulation, requires triiodothyronine (T3) produced by deiodination of thyroxine (T4) by fetal brain deiodinases. Experimental animal models have shown that transient intrauterine deficits of thyroid hormones (as brief as 3 days) result in permanent alterations of cerebral cortical architecture reminiscent of those observed in brains of patients with autism. I postulate that early maternal hypothyroxinemia resulting in low T3 in the fetal brain during the period of neuronal cell migration (weeks 8-12 of pregnancy) may produce morphological brain changes leading to autism. Insufficient dietary iodine intake and a number of environmental antithyroid and goitrogenic agents can affect maternal thyroid function during pregnancy. The most common causes could include inhibition of deiodinases D2 or D3 from maternal ingestion of dietary flavonoids or from antithyroid environmental contaminants. Some plant isoflavonoids have profound effects on thyroid hormones and on the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Genistein and daidzein from soy (Glycine max) inhibit thyroperoxidase that catalyzes iodination and thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Other plants with hypothyroid effects include pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) and fonio millet (Digitaria exilis); thiocyanate is found in Brassicae plants including cabbage, cauliflower, kale, rutabaga, and kohlrabi, as well as in tropical plants such as cassava, lima beans, linseed, bamboo shoots, and sweet potatoes. Tobacco smoke is also a source of thiocyanate. Environmental contaminants interfere with thyroid function including 60% of all herbicides, in particular 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), acetochlor, aminotriazole, amitrole, bromoxynil, pendamethalin, mancozeb, and thioureas. Other antithyroid agents include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), perchlorates, mercury, and coal derivatives such as resorcinol, phthalates, and anthracenes. A leading ecological study in Texas has correlated higher rates of autism in school districts affected by large environmental releases of mercury from industrial sources. Mercury is a well known antithyroid substance causing inhibition of deiodinases and thyroid peroxidase. The current surge of autism could be related to transient maternal hypothyroxinemia resulting from dietary and/or environmental exposure to antithyroid agents. Additional multidisciplinary epidemiological studies will be required to confirm this environmental hypothesis of autism. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

"1573","1532"," A. Caufriez","Hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopause: a reappraisal","Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment currently available for vasomotor and urogenital symptoms and decreased libido. Because harmful effects were evidenced in some clinical trials, health authorities now consider that risk-benefit considerations do not favour the use of HRT for prevention of cardiovascular diseases and bone fractures in postmenopausal women. However, experimental and clinical studies indicate that adverse effects of HRT may largely depend on the estrogen and progesterone/progestin formulation, dosage, mode of administration, patient's age, associated diseases, and duration of treatment. All estrogen formulations and modes of administration have similar beneficial effects on vasomotor and urogenital symptoms and on bone structure. But cardiovascular and invasive breast cancer risks are higher with oral estrogen than with transdermal estradiol, and also higher with many progestin compounds than with micronized progesterone. The combination of transdermal estradiol + micronized progesterone appears to be effective and relatively safe if elementary precautions are taken, and seems to be presently the best choice for HRT in most postmenopausal women. In the author's - heterodox - opinion, HRT may also be a good therapeutic choice to prevent bone loss, since alternative medications, including raloxifene and bisphosphonates, may have dramatic harmful effects in some patients. It might also have beneficial effects on the development of coronary disease in young postmenopausal women. HRT requires careful adjustment to each individual patient and continuous monitoring of clinical evolution. In the future, this adjustment could benefit from genetic screening to maximize in each individual the ratio between positive and adverse effects. 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Genistein showed 50% cell growth inhibition at IC50=27.5+0.8 mumol/l in 24 h incubation under 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay conditions. Genistein is known to express both cell growth activity at nanomolar concentrations and anti-cell growth activity at micromolar concentrations. It was found that genistein at 100 mumol/l concentration effectively induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in 24 h. Genistein-induced apoptosis involved activation of calpain, caspase 7 and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase. Dantrolene, an inhibitor of Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum, inhibited genistein-induced activation of calpain and caspase 7, in addition to effectively negating genistein-induced apoptosis. MCF-7 cells treated with genistein also showed increased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas no effect was observed for extracellular signal-regulating kinase 1/2. Phosphorylation of apoptosis signaling kinase 1, an upstream regulator of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, was also increased by genistein treatment. Genistein-induced phosphorylation of apoptosis signaling kinase 1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was diminished by the presence of dantrolene. These results suggest that genistein-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells is mediated through calpain-caspase 7 and apoptosis signaling kinase 1-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation cascades that involve Ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum. 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",NA,"apoptosis article assay *breast cancer calcium transport cancer cell culture cancer inhibition cell growth controlled study endoplasmic reticulum enzyme activation human human cell priority journal protein phosphorylation 3 (4,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide calcium/ec [Endogenous Compound] calpain caspase/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase 7/ec [Endogenous Compound] dantrolene *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] mitogen activated protein kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase p38/ec [Endogenous Compound] nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound]","649-657","18","2007",-1

Banerjee","Akt-GSK-3 pathway as a target in genistein-induced inhibition of TRAMP prostate cancer progression toward a poorly differentiated phenotype","Anti-proliferative properties of genistein in prostate and other cancers have been studied extensively. However, the identification of genistein targets that may mediate its chemopreventive effects in vivo requires further elucidation. In this study, we have demonstrated that the incorporation of genistein in the diet of transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate model (TRAMP/FVB) mice resulted in a reduction in prostate size and the incidence of poorly differentiated (PD) cancer ensuing in an accumulation of prostates at the prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN) stage. TRAMP/FVB prostate cancer progression and the onset of PD cancer were characterized by the activation of acutely transforming retrovirus AKT8 in rodent T cell lymphoma (Akt), phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK-3beta), post-transcriptional up-regulation of cyclin D1 and repression of cadherin-1 via snail-1 up-regulation. Incorporation of genistein in the diet significantly inhibited the activation of Akt, restored the activation of GSK-3beta, reduced cyclin D1 levels post-transcriptionally and maintained the expression of the cadherin-1 complex via down-regulation of snail-1. By identifying the Akt-GSK-3 pathway and subsequently its downstream effectors, as targets for genistein chemopreventive action, we have elucidated one possible mechanism by which genistein decreases the proliferative potential, retards cancer progression and maintains the integrity of the prostatic epithelial cells in vivo.

We review promising agents for prostate cancer prevention, clinical trial designs and how these agents may be used clinically. Materials and Methods: We reviewed current and completed randomized chemoprevention trials for prostate cancer as well as the most promising agents for which evidence suggests that a decreased prostate cancer risk may result from their use. Results: Evidence suggests that lycopene, decreased dietary fat, antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol and selenium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective estrogen receptor modulators such as toremifene and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors may prove useful for decreasing the risk of prostate cancer in a man. Ongoing studies are examining these agents in the 3 general scenarios of 1) general population studies (finasteride, alpha-tocopherol and selenium), 2) increased prostate specific antigen with negative biopsy (dutasteride) and 3) prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (toremifene and selenium). Conclusions: There are many agents that may decrease the risk of prostate cancer. It requires careful study of the agents in specific populations to determine whether risk is reduced, the magnitude of the risk reduction and the spectrum of side effects associated with the agent. Physicians caring for men entering the range of age of prostate cancer risk must be aware of these preventive opportunities. 2007 American Urological Association.",NA,"antioxidant activity article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer chemotherapy cancer control *cancer prevention cancer research cancer risk cardiovascular disease/ep [Epidemiology] cardiovascular disease/pc [Prevention] cardiovascular risk dietary intake digital rectal examination drug efficacy Gleason score human low fat diet lung cancer/ep [Epidemiology] lung cancer/pc [Prevention] male nonhuman priority journal prostate biopsy *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] risk reduction soybean tea tomato treatment outcome tumor volume *alpha tocopherol/pd [Pharmacology] antioxidant catechin cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor dutasteride/do [Drug Dose] dutasteride/dt [Drug Therapy] dutasteride/pd [Pharmacology] finasteride/dt [Drug Therapy] finasteride/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone *lycopene nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent polyphenol prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] rofecoxib *selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] *selenium/po [Oral Drug Administration] steroid 5alpha reductase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] *steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] *toremifene/do [Drug Dose] *toremifene/dt [Drug Therapy] *toremifene/pd [Pharmacology]","S9-S13","178","2007",-1

Kim","Age-related uterotrophic response of soy isoflavone intake in rats","This study investigated the effects of soy isoflavone intake on uterotrophic responses in growing (juvenile) and adult female rats. In the growing rats, feed intake showed a decreasing trend as the level of dietary isoflavones increased to 0.02%, 0.1%, and 0.2% of the diets. However, in the case of the adult rats there were no significant differences among groups. Weight gains were significantly lower in the rats fed 0.1% and 0.2% isoflavones than the controls in both juvenile and adult rats. The urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein was significantly increased with increasing levels of dietary isoflavones. The calculated urinary recoveries of daidzein and genistein were significantly lower in the groups fed 0.1% and 0.2% isoflavones compared to the juvenile and adult rat groups fed 0.02% isoflavones; no significant difference was observed between the 0.1% and 0.2% groups. The calculated urinary recoveries of daidzein and genistein in the adult rats were significantly higher than in the juvenile rats. The differences in the urinary recoveries between ages may be due to greater availability of the isoflavones in the adult rats. Isoflavone supplementation did not alter the histological phenotype of endometrial cells in growing rats, but a hyperplastic response of endometrium was shown in the adult rats. Dietary isoflavones, therefore, may not have an estrogenic effect on the uterus at these dose levels during the growth period, but this organ would be expected to be a likely target for isoflavone action in adults. We observed in the present study that isoflavones are more bioavailable in adult rats than in the juvenile rats. Therefore, soy isoflavone supplementation may not act as an endocrine disrupter during the growth period but may exert a phytoestrogenic effect on the uterus of adult rats.

To clarify its influence on mammary carcinogenesis, female rats were administrated 7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) once, and when the incidence of palpable mammary tumors reached 50%, subjected to ovariectomy (OVX) and divided into tumor-bearing [DMBA-Tumor (+)] and no-tumor-bearing [DMBA-Tumor (-)] groups, subgroups of each then being fed soybean-free diet containing 0, 40, 200, and 1000 ppm of arctiin for 31 wk. The incidence and multiplicity of palpable tumors in the 200 ppm DMBA-Tumor (+) subgroup from week 12 of arctiin treatment tended to be decreased as compared to the 0 ppm subgroup and at terminal sacrifice, the volume of histopathologically defined mammary tumors was decreased in the 40 ppm DMBA-Tumor (-) subgroup, but again without statistical significance. In conclusion, weak inhibitory effects of arctiin on DMBA-induced mammary tumor development were suggested in OVX rats, but any further assessment is needed to obtain conclusive results.

Ornish","Relationship of dietary protein and soy isoflavones to serum IGF-1 and IGF binding proteins in the prostate cancer lifestyle trial","High levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer, whereas increased levels of some of its binding proteins (IGFBPs) seem to be protective. High intakes of dietary protein, especially animal and soy protein, appear to increase IGF-1. However, soy isoflavones have demonstrated anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects both in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated dietary intakes of total protein and soy isoflavones in relation to the IGF axis in prostate cancer patients making comprehensive lifestyle changes including a very low-fat vegan diet supplemented with soy protein (58 g/day). After one year, intervention group patients reported significantly higher intakes of dietary protein and soy isoflavones compared to usual-care controls (P < 0.001). IGF-1 increased significantly in both groups, whereas IGFBP-1 rose in the experimental group only (P < 0.01). Increases in vegetable protein over one year were associated with increases in IGFBP-1 among intervention group patients (P < 0.05). These results suggest that dietary protein and soy isoflavones, in the context of comprehensive lifestyle changes, may not significantly alter IGF-1. However, given the recent literature indicating that high intake of protein rich in essential amino acids (animal or soy protein) may increase IGF-1, it may be prudent for men with early stage prostate cancer not to exceed dietary protein recommendations.

Zhou","Genistein sensitizes inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on the growth of estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer cells","Although tamoxifen (TAM) is used for the front-line treatment and prevention of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast tumors, nearly 40% of estrogen-dependent breast tumors do not respond to TAM treatment. Moreover, the positive response is usually of short duration, and most tumors eventually develop TAM-resistance. Overexpression of HER2 gene is associated with TAM-resistance of breast tumor, and suppression of HER2 expression enhances the TAM activity. Soy isoflavone genistein has been shown to have anti-cancer activities and suppress expression of HER2 and ERa. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that genistein may sensitize the response of ER+ and HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells to TAM treatment. The combination treatment of TAM and genistein inhibited the growth of ER+/HER2-overexpressing BT-474 human breast cancer cells in a synergistic manner in vitro. Determination of cellular markers indicated that this synergistic inhibitory effect might be contributed in part from combined effects on cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase and on induction of apoptosis. Further determination of the molecular markers showed that TAM and genistein combination synergistically induced BT-474 cell apoptosis in part by synergistic downregulation of the expression of survivin, one of the apoptotic effectors, and downregulation of EGFR, HER2, and ERalpha expression. Our research may provide a novel approach for the prevention and/or treatment of TAM insensitive/resistant human breast cancer, and warrants further in vivo studies to verify the efficacy of genistein and TAM combination on the growth of ER+/HER2-overexpressing breast tumors and to elucidate the in vivo mechanisms of synergistic actions. 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"apoptosis article *breast cancer cancer cell culture cell cycle arrest cell cycle G1 phase controlled study culture medium down regulation drug effect drug potentiation drug response gene gene overexpression growth inhibition human human cell oncogene neu priority journal protein expression epidermal growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/dv [Drug Development] *genistein/it [Drug Interaction] survivin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *tamoxifen/dv [Drug Development] *tamoxifen/it [Drug Interaction]","534-542","46","2007",-1

Rivera","Flavonoids inhibit the platelet TxA2 signalling pathway and antagonize TxA2 receptors (TP) in platelets and smooth muscle cells","Aims: Flavonoids may affect platelet function by several mechanisms, including antagonism of TxA2 receptors (TP). These TP are present in many tissues and modulate different signalling cascades. We explored whether flavonoids affect platelet TP signalling, and if they bind to TP expressed in other cell types. Methods: Platelets were treated with flavonoids, or other selected inhibitors, and then stimulated with U46619. Similar assays were performed in aspirinized platelets activated with thrombin. Effects on calcium release were analysed by fluorometry and changes in whole protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of ERK 1/2 by Western blot analysis. The binding of flavonoids to TP in platelets, human myometrium and TPalpha- and TPbeta-transfected HEK 293T cells was explored using binding assays and the TP antagonist 3H-SQ29548. Results: Apigenin, genistein, luteolin and quercetin impaired U46619-induced calcium mobilization in a concentration- dependent manner (IC50 10-30 mum). These flavonoids caused a significant impairment of U46619-induced platelet tyrosine phosphorylation and of ERK 1/2 activation. By contrast, in aspirin-treated platelets all these flavonoids, except quercetin, displayed minor effects on thrombin-induced calcium mobilization, ERK 1/2 and total tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, apigenin, genistein and luteolin inhibited by >50% 3H-SQ29548 binding to different cell types. Conclusions: These data further suggest that flavonoids may inhibit platelet function by binding to TP and by subsequent abrogation of downstream signalling. Binding of these compounds to TP occurs in human myometrium and in TP-transfected HEK 293T cells and suggests that antagonism of TP might mediate the effects of flavonoids in different tissues. 2007 The Authors.",NA,"alpha chain *antioxidant activity article beta chain binding assay calcium mobilization calcium transport cell type comparative study concentration process controlled study down regulation drug mechanism drug receptor binding enzyme activation fluorometry human human cell IC 50 myometrium normal human *pharmacological blocking priority journal protein phosphorylation signal transduction *smooth muscle fiber thrombocyte *thrombocyte function Western blotting 15 hydroxy 11alpha,9alpha epoxymethanoprosta 5,13 dienoic acid 7 [3 [(4 phenylsemicarbazido)methyl] 7 oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept 2 yl] 5 heptenoic acid/pd [Pharmacology] 7 [3 [(4 phenylsemicarbazido)methyl] 7 oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept 2 yl] 5 heptenoic acid h 3 acetylsalicylic acid *apigenin/cm [Drug Comparison] *apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] calcium/ec [Endogenous Compound] flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *luteolin/cm [Drug Comparison] *luteolin/pd [Pharmacology] mitogen activated protein kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein tyrosine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *quercetin/cm [Drug Comparison] *quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] radioisotope receptor subtype/ec [Endogenous Compound] thrombin *thromboxane A2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *thromboxane A2 receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] thromboxane A2 receptor blocking agent tritium unclassified drug","133-144","64","2007",-1

We initially investigated the effects of soy isoflavone genistein and TAM on the growth and cell cycle progression of estrogen-dependent MCF-7 human BRCA cells, and on the expression of ERalpha, pS2 and EGFR genes in vitro. Genistein or TAM alone inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells in part via G1 phase arrest, but their combinations showed suggestive antagonistic effects. We further evaluated the effects of bioactive soy components and TAM on the growth inhibition of MCF-7 tumors in a clinically relevant breast tumor model. TAM and bioactive soy components, genistein and soy phytochemical concentrate (SPC), delayed the growth of MCF-7 tumors. The combination of TAM with genistein or SPC, especially at the lower dose of TAM, had synergistic effects on delaying the growth of MCF-7 tumors. Biomarker determination suggests that the combination of TAM and soy components may synergistically delay the growth of MCF-7 tumors via their combined effects on induction of tumor cell apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. In addition, genistein and TAM combination synergistically delayed the growth of breast tumor via decreased estrogen level and activity, and down-regulation of EGFR expression. The results fromay be warranted to determine if the combination of TAM and bioactive soy components may be used for prevention and/or treatment of estrogen-dependent BRCA. The Author 2007.

This study sought to obtain pilot data about the prevalence of consumption of DS (which include vitamin/ mineral supplements [VS] and herbal supplements [HS]) among patients undergoing chemotherapy and to assess the relationship between DS consumption and both cancer prognosis and secondary cancer symptoms. In this pilot study, data on demographics, DS usage, presence of secondary cancer symptoms, and cancer diagnosis and stage were collected on 100 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal cancer and 40 with breast cancer who were receiving active chemotherapy from April 2004 to July 2004. Overall prevalence of DS consumption was 52.52% + 8.3% (VS, 48.2% + 8.31%; HS, 23.74% + 7.07%). Of HS users, 42.42% + 16.86% used multiple HS. Factors significantly associated with higher consumption of HS were female gender and presence of metastasis, fatigue, and cancer pain. No significant associations between consumption of DS or HS and age, cancer type, presence of pain, sleep problems, or sexual problems were seen. Approximately half of the patients undergoing chemotherapy in this pilot survey were using DS, including HS - which heralds the potential for drug-supplement interactions and warrants caution. Consumption of HS was greater among people having a higher cancer stage and symptoms such as fatigue or cancer pain; patients in these subgroups probably should be screened actively for DS use. Further studies are needed to confirm these results. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Barnes","Curcumin reverses breast tumor exosomes mediated immune suppression of NK cell tumor cytotoxicity","An important characteristic of tumors is that they at some point in their development overcome the surveillance of the immune system. Tumors secrete exosomes, multivesicular bodies containing a distinct set of proteins that can fuse with cells of the circulating immune system. Purified exosomes from TS/A breast cancer cells, but not non-exosomal fractions, inhibit (at concentrations of nanograms per ml protein) IL-2-induced natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The dietary polyphenol, curcumin (diferuloylmethane), partially reverses tumor exosome-mediated inhibition of natural killer cell activation, which is mediated through the impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Exposure of mouse breast tumor cells to curcumin causes a dose-dependent increase in ubiquitinated exosomal proteins compared to those in untreated TS/A breast tumor cells. Furthermore, exosomes isolated from tumor cells pretreated with curcumin have a much attenuated inhibition of IL-2 stimulated NK cell activation. Jak3-mediated activation of Stat5 is required for tumor cytotoxicity of IL-2 stimulated NK cells. TS/A tumor exosomes strongly inhibit activation of Stat5, whereas the tumor exosomes isolated from curcumin-pretreated tumor cells have a lowered potency for inhibition of IL-2 stimulated NK cell cytotoxicity. These data suggest that partial reversal of tumor exosome-mediated inhibition of NK cell tumor cytotoxicity may account for the anti-cancer properties of curcumin. 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, it is desirable to have both agonists and antagonists with selectivity for one or the other ER isoform available. In a previous study we showed that 2,5-diphenylfurans can be converted into pure antiestrogens with preference for ERalpha. When the arrangement of the phenyl rings was altered to a 2,4-substitution, the alpha-selectivity was lost as demonstrated by comparative assays using recombinant human ERalpha and ERbeta. 3,5-Dialkyl-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenylfurans) were shown to act as agonists with preference for ERbeta. Replacement of one of the alkyl groups by the [(pentylsulfanyl)propyl]aminohexyl side chain afforded estrogen antagonists without receptor selectivity. These derivatives were characterized as pure antiestrogens in transcription and proliferation assays in ER+ MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The most potent antagonists displayed IC50 values of ca. 20 nM (fulvestrant 4 nM). The data showed that the 2,4-arrangement of the phenyl rings in the furan structure increases the binding affinity for ERbeta in comparison to the isomeric 2,5-diphenylfurans but does not lead to a pure antagonist with selectivity for ERbeta. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The effects of a 6-month supplementation challenge with selenium, vitamin E, and soy isoflavonoids in men diagnosed with isolated HGPIN on biopsy were evaluated. A total of 100 patients entered the study. Of the 100 men, 29 were excluded because they refused additional biopsies or were noncompliant with the protocol, 71 underwent repeat biopsies at 3 months, and 58 underwent a third set at 6 months. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was recorded at inclusion and before each set of biopsies. The study endpoint was defined as the diagnosis of PCa at 3 months or the histopathologic status at 6 months. Results: At the study endpoint, PCa had been found in 24 men (33.8%), HGPIN in 34 (47.9%), and no HGPIN or carcinoma in 13 (18.3%). The PCa risk throughout the study period was 25.0% in the group with a stable or decreasing PSA level (n = 48, 67.6%) and 52.2% in the group with an increasing PSA level (n = 23, 32.4%). This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0458). Isolated HGPIN remaining at the first repeat biopsy and the percentage of initial cores with HGPIN were significant predictors of PCa at additional biopsies. Conclusions: The results of our study have shown that a decrease in the PSA level while taking a selenium, vitamin E, and soy isoflavonoids supplement predicts for a significantly lower risk of PCa in future biopsies. The percentage of initial biopsy cores with HGPIN and isolated HGPIN remaining at the first repeat biopsy are significant predictors of PCa in future biopsies. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: LNCaP cells were treated with 100, 400 or 1400 mug/mL BCE; proliferation was assessed with an Alamar Blue assay. We used real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to quantify mRNA expression of the androgen receptor (AR), the AR coactivator prostate derived Ets transcription factor (PDEF), NKX3.1, prostate specific antigen (PSA) and oestrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta) compared with the expression of the housekeeping gene porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). PSA secretion from LNCaP cells was measured and protein expression of the AR investigated by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Concomitant with a marked decrease of tumour cell proliferation BCE down-regulated the expression of the AR, PDEF, NKX3.1 and PSA. In the same experiments, the expression of PBGD was unaltered, whereas ER-beta expression increased. Furthermore, AR protein and PSA secretion were markedly diminished after treatments with the BCE. CONCLUSION: BCE, comprising 13 different phytoestrogens, decreases the expression of the AR and its co-activator PDEF concomitant with diminished cell proliferation and PSA secretion. NKX3.1 expression was also reduced by BCE. We hypothesise that the positive effects of BCE are initiated by up-regulation of the ER-beta, a putative tumour-suppressor gene. 2007 The Authors.",NA,"antineoplastic activity article belamcanda chinensis cancer cell culture cancer growth cancer inhibition cell proliferation cell strain LNCaP chemoprophylaxis controlled study down regulation *hormonal regulation housekeeping gene human human cell male medicinal plant priority journal *prostate cancer protein expression reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction therapy effect treatment outcome Western blotting *androgen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *belamcanda chinensis extract/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen *plant extract porphobilinogen deaminase/ec [Endogenous Compound] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Ets/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor NKX 3.1/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","199-203","100","2007",-1

Our objective was to examine the effect of physiologically relevant concentrations of BCA and GEN on gene expression in normal (HMEC), immortalized but nontumorigenic (MCF12A), and tumorigenic (MCF7) mammary cells and to determine whether the differences in gene expression are related to differences in metabolism in the three types of mammary cells. Using cDNA arrays, we compared the gene expression after a 48-h incubation with .1 muM BCA, GEN, or vehicle. Treatment with GEN or BCA produced the greatest number of significant changes in HMEC compared with MCFI2A or MCF7 cells. Unlike GEN, effects of BCA on gene expression were mostly beneficial, involving induction of tumor suppressor genes. Different extents of metabolism were observed in the three mammary cell types; however, GEN concentrations were very low following either GEN or BCA administration in all of the three cell types. Because there were only very low concentrations of GEN, compared with BCA concentrations, in HMEC and MCF12A cells treated with BCA and different gene expression changes were found after BCA and GEN treatment, these findings suggest that BCA has distinct effects compared with GEN. The results suggest that BCA may represent a better breast cancer-preventive agent than GEN.

Two doses of equol (50 mg/ kg of chow and 400 mg/kg of chow) were used and the results were compared with the effects of estradiol 3-benzoate (E2B), also given at two doses (4.3 mg/kg of chow and 17.3 mg/kg of chow). Treatment period was 3 months. Dietary equol administration at the high dose increased significantly serum PRL levels. This effect was also observed in the E2B group but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Surprisingly, high dose dietary equol treatment also significantly increased serum LH levels, which was in contrast to E2B treatment where serum LH levels were significantly decreased at both doses. Serum LH levels in the equol low group were unaffected. Equol treatment had no effects on pituitary ERalpha or ERbeta gene expression. In contrast, high dose E2B treatment increased significantly pituitary ERalpha mRNA levels but decreased those of ERbeta. Both doses of E2B also increased significantly pituitary TERP-1 mRNA levels. This effect was also observed in the equol high group but at a much smaller magnitude. In conclusion, high dose dietary equol administration to ovx rats exerts estrogenic like effects on the lactotropes and anti-estrogenic on the gonadotropes.

This study characterized the effects of a soy-derived isoflavone concentrate (ISF) on growth and gene expression profiles in the LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line. ISF caused a dose-dependent decrease in viability (P < 0.05) and DNA synthesis (P < 0.01), as well as an accumulation of cells in G2/M, and G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle compared with controls. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide DNA microarrays (U133A), we determined that ISF upregulated 80 genes and downregulated 33 genes (P < 0.05) involving androgen-regulated genes and pathways controlling cell cycle, metabolism, and intracellular trafficking. Changes in the expression of the genes of interest, identified by microarrays, were validated by Western immunoblot, Northern blot, and luciferase reporter assays. Prostate-specific antigen, homeobox protein NKX3, and cyclin B mRNA were significantly reduced, whereas mRNA was significantly upregulated for p21CIP1, a major cell cycle inhibitory protein, and fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis pathway genes. ISF also significantly increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 and FOXO3A/FKHRL1, a forkhead transcription factor. A differential pattern of androgen-regulated genes was apparent with genes involved in prostate cancer progression being downregulated by ISF, whereas metabolism genes were upregulated. In summary,we found that ISF inhibits the growth of LNCaP cells through the modulation of cell cycle progression and the differential expression of androgen-regulated genes. Thus, ISF treatment serves to identify new therapeutic targets designed to prevent proliferation of malignant prostate cells. 2007 American Society for Nutrition.",NA,"article cancer cell cell strain LNCaP cell viability cholesterol synthesis controlled study diet supplementation dietary intake DNA microarray DNA synthesis flow cytometry gene expression human human cell immunoblotting lipogenesis Northern blotting prostate cancer soybean Western blotting cyclin B/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B/ec [Endogenous Compound] homeodomain protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor FKHRL1/ec [Endogenous Compound]","964-972","137","2007",-1

The lipido-sterolic extract of the fruit of Serenoa repens is one of the more widely used phytotherapeutic agents in this regard. Materials and Methods: The effect of an ethanolic extract of S. repens (10-1000 mug/ml) was tested in hormone-sensitive LNCaP, MCF-7 and hormone-insensitive DU 145, MDA MB231 prostate, breast carcinoma cell lines, renal Caki-1, urinary bladder J82, colon HCT 116 and lung A 549 cancer cells. Its cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects were tested using WST-1 assay and flow cytometry (Annexin V/PI stain) and/or by colorimetrie assay (APOPercentage assay). Results: The S. repens extract induced a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on all human malignant cells tested, with GI50 values between 107 and 327 mug/ml. In hormone-sensitive prostate LNCaP and breast MCF-7 cell lines, the effect of extract expressed in GI50 was 2.2- and 2.5-fold more potent (p<0.01) than in hormone-insensitive DU145 and MDA MB231 cells. The proportion of apoptotic cells, except in A549 cells, lay between 22.5-36.3%. S. repens extract did not induce apoptosis in lung cancer A 549 cells. Conclusion: This study showed that the antiproliferative effect exerted by the ethanolic extract of S. repens is at least triggered by induction of apoptosis.

Here, using 120 estrogen responsive genes, we examined comparative expression profiles between the profile in breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with 17beta-estradiol and the profiles in other cell lines derived from breast (T-47D and HBC-4 cells), endometrium (Ishikawa cells) and kidney (RXF-631L cells) treated with estrogenic chemicals. First, comparative profiling between MCF-7 and T-47D cells showed similar (correlation coefficient or R value = 0.49-0.87) profiles for all chemicals examined: 17beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol, diethylstilbestrol, bisphenol A, nonylphenol and genistein. The analysis using other cell lines indicated that significant correlations to the profile in MCF-7 cells treated with 17beta-estradiol were observed for the profiles in Ishikawa cells treated with 17beta-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol and bisphenol A, and HBC-4 cells treated with 17beta-estradiol. The profiles for diethylstilbestrol and bisphenol A in HBC-4 cells and all three chemicals in RXF-631L cells did not show significant correlation with those in MCF-7 cells. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that there are cell-specific responses to estrogenic chemicals (T-47D and HBC-4 cells for example). Correlation analysis using six (proliferation, transcription, transport, enzymes, signaling and others) functionally-categorized gene groups indicated that the genes related to enzymes showed greater correlations for all chemicals tested in T-47D cells and some chemicals in Ishikawa and HBC-4 cells while those related to transcription contributed to variations. 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental factors, such as dietary habits, may play a major role in the causation of prostate cancer. Although isoflavones have been suggested to show a preventive effect against prostate cancer in animal experiments, the results of epidemiologic studies are inconsistent. Here, we conducted a population-based prospective study in 43,509 Japanese men ages 45 to 74 years who generally have a high intake of isoflavones and low incidence of prostate cancer. Participants responded to a validated questionnaire, which included 147 food items. During follow-up from 1995 through 2004, 307 men were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, of which 74 cases were advanced, 220 cases were organ localized, and 13 cases were of an undetermined stage. Intakes of genistein, daidzein, miso soup, and soy food were not associated with total prostate cancer. However, these four items decreased the risk of localized prostate cancer. In contrast, positive associations were seen between isoflavones and advanced prostate cancer. These results were strengthened when analysis was confined to men ages >60 years, in whom isoflavones and soy food were associated with a dose-dependent decrease in the risk of localized cancer, with relative risks for men in the highest quartile of genistein, daidzein, and soy food consumption compared with the lowest of 0.52 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.30-0.90], 0.50 (95% CI, 0.28-0.88), and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.29-0.90), respectively. In conclusion, we found that isoflavone intake was associated with a decreased risk of localized prostate cancer.

White","GCP-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells via androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms","BACKGROUND. Genistein combined polysaccharide (GCP) is a nutritional supplement that can inhibit prostate cancer growth experimentally and clinically. It is composed predominantly of the isoflavones genistein, daidzein, and glycitein, which have anti-cancer properties. Although genistein is well studied, the properties of GCP are not well defined. The goal of this work was to better characterize the signaling pathways impacted by GCP in an effort to optimize its efficacy. METHODS. Cell growth and apoptosis were evaluated by MTS proliferation, caspase-based assays, and flow cytometry. Modulation of androgen receptor (AR) levels and activation status of signaling molecules were monitored by immunoblot analysis. AR function was measured by evaluating prostate-specific antigen (PSA) message and protein levels and by reporter assays. RESULTS. GCP inhibited proliferation of androgen-dependent LNCaP and androgen-independent LNCaP-p53GOF and 22Rv1 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and cells were more responsive in the presence of androgen. GCP markedly suppressed mTOR-p70S6K signaling while Akt and p53 were only modestly modulated. GCP significantly attenuated androgen signaling as evidenced by diminished AR protein levels and a consequent reduction in transcriptional activity and PSA expression. AR expression was enhanced by de-repression of translation with inhibitors of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and by inhibition of proteasome-dependent degradation. Neither inhibitor could counteract GCP-mediated AR downregulation, suggesting the involvement of a mechanism(s) independent of these pathways. CONCLUSIONS. Our results suggest that GCP mediates growth inhibition and apoptosis through multiple mechanisms including (1) molecular mimicry of androgen ablation (via AR downregulation) and (2) by providing an AR-independent, pro-apoptotic signal (mTOR inhibition). 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"apoptosis article cancer cell culture cancer inhibition cell proliferation controlled study drug activity drug mechanism flow cytometry human human cell immunoblotting priority journal *prostate cancer androgen *androgen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase *genistein/dv [Drug Development] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein combined polysaccharide/dv [Drug Development] *genistein combined polysaccharide/pd [Pharmacology] mammalian target of rapamycin/ec [Endogenous Compound] phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] proteasome/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein p53/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","521-535","67","2007",-1

In order to examine donor age effect, fibroblasts from 19- (young) or 49- (aged) year-old females were used. Culture medium was supplemented with nutrients complex containing soy extract, tomato extract, grape seed extract, white tea extract, sodium ascorbate, tocopherol acetate, zinc gluconate and BioMarine complex. Epidermal and dermal structure and composition were examined after 42 and 60 days of culture. In untreated samples, SE generated from young fibroblasts was superior to SE from aged fibroblasts in all characteristics. Those include number and regularity of keratinocyte layers, number of keratinocytes expressing proliferation marker Ki67, content of collagen type I, fibrillin-1, elastin, and SE lifespan. Effects of nutritional supplementation were observed in SE from both young and aged fibroblasts, however, those effects were more pronounced in SE from aged fibroblasts. In epidermis, the treatment increased number of keratinocyte layers and delayed epidermal senescence. The number of cells expressing Ki67 was nine folds higher than those of controls, and was similar to that of young cell SE. In dermis, the treatment increased mRNA synthesis of collagen I, fibrillin-1 and elastin. In conclusion, skin cell donor age had major important effect on formation of reconstructed SE. Imperfections in epidermal and dermal structure and composition as well as life span in SE from aged cells can be improved by supplementation with active nutrients.

Furthermore, the expression of BCRP seemed most likely to be aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) dependent. Since numerous plant-derived anticarcinogens with AhR-agonistic activity have been identified to date, in the present study we investigated the effects of naturally occurring dietary compounds and tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) for their effects on BCRP expression. In Caco-2 cells, the most pronounced induction of BCRP expression could be observed after treatment with TBHQ (100muM), dibenzoylmethane (DBM, 50muM), and quercetin (25muM), while green tea component (-)-epicatechin (50muM) decreased BCRP expression. On mRNA level, quercetin, chrysin, flavone, and indole-3-carbinol showed a strong inducing effect, while genistein had no effect on BCRP mRNA expression. Curcumin and resveratrol showed a strong effect on BCRP induction in MCF-7 wild-type cells but no response in AhR-deficient MCF-7AHR200 cells, supporting our hypothesis that BCRP is regulated via AhR-dependent signaling pathways. Inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation of ligand-activated AhR caused a ""superinduction"" of BCRP mRNA. Antioxidant responsive element activators sulforaphane and diethylmaleate (DEM) had no inducing effect on BCRP mRNA expression. Caco-2 cells pretreated with quercetin or DBM showed an enhancement of apically transported benzo[a]pyrene-3-sulfate, indicating that induced BCRP was functionally active. In conclusion, apart from the modulation of detoxifying enzymes in the intestine, induction of BCRP by dietary constituents may contribute to the detoxification of food-derived procarcinogens such as BP. 2007 Oxford University Press.",NA,"antioxidant responsive element article cell strain CACO 2 cell strain MCF 7 concentration (parameters) controlled study degradation kinetics detoxification drug structure food composition human human cell hypothesis inhibition kinetics nucleotide sequence protein expression protein function protein induction signal transduction tea transport kinetics wild type 3 indolemethanol/an [Drug Analysis] 3 indolemethanol/pd [Pharmacology] aromatic hydrocarbon receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *benzo[a]pyrene derivative/to [Drug Toxicity] *breast cancer resistance protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] carcinogen/to [Drug Toxicity] chrysin/an [Drug Analysis] chrysin/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/an [Drug Analysis] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] dibenzoylmethane derivative/an [Drug Analysis] dibenzoylmethane derivative/pd [Pharmacology] epicatechin/an [Drug Analysis] epicatechin/pd [Pharmacology] flavone/an [Drug Analysis] flavone/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] maleic acid diethyl ester messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *plant medicinal product/an [Drug Analysis] *plant medicinal product/pd [Pharmacology] proteasome/ec [Endogenous Compound] quercetin/an [Drug Analysis] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] resveratrol/an [Drug Analysis] resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] silibinin/an [Drug Analysis] silibinin/pd [Pharmacology] sulforaphane tert butylhydroquinone/an [Drug Analysis] tert butylhydroquinone/pd [Pharmacology]","227-236","96","2007",-1

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that soy food consumption may interact with polymorphisms in the 17beta-HSD1 gene in the development of endometrial cancer and evaluated this hypothesis in the Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Study. METHODS: Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Study is a population-based case-control study conducted among Chinese women in Shanghai. This study consisted of 1204 incident endometrial cancer cases diagnosed between 30 and 69 years of age and 1212 age frequency-matched community controls recruited from 1997 to 2003. Overall participation rates were 82.8% for cases and 74.4% for controls, whereas the DNA collection rates were 95.1% for cases and 94.2% for controls. RESULTS: We found that women carrying at least one A allele of the rs605059 polymorphism had a significant 18% reduction in risk of endometrial cancer compared with those without an A allele, and the association was primarily restricted to premenopausal women. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.65 (0.47-0.88) for premenopausal women with at least one A allele versus those without an A allele. We also found that among premenopausal women soy isoflavone intake significantly interacted with the rs605059 genotype in relation to endometrial cancer and that the inverse association between soy isoflavone intake and endometrial cancer only appeared among those with at least one A allele of the rs605059 polymorphism. Among postmenopausal women, the association of soy isoflavone intake with endometrial cancer did not differ by 17beta-HSD1 genotypes. We did not find that the rs2676530 polymorphism was significantly associated with endometrial cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that soy consumption may interact with polymorphisms in the 17beta-HSD1 gene in relation to endometrial cancer risk.

In this study, we further investigated signaling events involved in oridonin-induced apoptosis in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. It was found that the total tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited and the protein expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phosphorylated EGFR were decreased in oridonin-induced A431 cell apoptosis. Expression of EGFR downstream effector proteins, Grb2, Ras, Raf-1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), was also downregulated by oridonin. Moreover, the oridonin-induced apoptosis was augmented by the Ras inhibitor manumycin A, Raf-1 inhibitor GW5074, or ERK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that inactivation of Ras, Raf, or ERK participates in oridonin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, oridonin-induced apoptosis in A431 cells might be through blocking EGFR and its downstream Ras/Raf/ERK signal pathway. 2007 The Japanese Pharmacological Society.",NA,"apoptosis article cancer cell culture controlled study down regulation drug mechanism drug potentiation enzyme activity enzyme inactivation human human cell protein expression protein phosphorylation signal transduction 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone/cb [Drug Combination] 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone/it [Drug Interaction] 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone/pd [Pharmacology] epidermal growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] growth factor receptor bound protein 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] gw 5074/cb [Drug Combination] gw 5074/it [Drug Interaction] gw 5074/pd [Pharmacology] manumycin a/cb [Drug Combination] manumycin a/it [Drug Interaction] mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *oridonin/cb [Drug Combination] *oridonin/cm [Drug Comparison] *oridonin/it [Drug Interaction] *oridonin/pd [Pharmacology] protein inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] protein tyrosine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] raf 1 inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] Raf protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] Ras protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] ras protein inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","56-66","103","2007",-1

Methods: Fifty-six adult castrated female Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups (eight animals in each) that received: GI-drug vehicle (propylene glycol); GII-soy extract 10 mg/kg per day; GIII-soy extract 50 mg/kg per day; GIV-soy extract 100 mg/kg per day; GV-soy extract 300 mg/kg per day; GVI-soy extract 600 mg/kg per day; GVII-conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 200 mug/kg per day. After 21 days of treatment, all animals were sacrificed and fragments of the uterine horns were immediately removed, fixed in 10% formaldehyde and submitted to routine histological techniques for morphometric study. The endometrial cell proliferation index was determined with the PCNA antibody PC-10 and expressed as the percentuals of the PCNA-positive nuclei relative to the total countings. Other fragments were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction and VEGF analysis using RT-PCR technique. Results: The minimal dose of soy extract that produced a significant increase of the morphometric parameters was 100 mg/kg (GIV). The maximum effects on endometrial and myometrial morphometry were detected in the groups treated with 300 and 600 mg/kg of soy extract (groups V and VI) and CEE (GVII). The expression of PCNA in the endometrial epithelium and stroma was increased by treatment with 100-600 mg/kg per day of soy extract (groups IV-VI) or with CCE (group VII). Doses equal to or higher than 50 mg/kg of soy extract (groups III-VI) and CEE stimulated the expression of VEGF.

Design: A self-administered, anonymous questionnaire containing 19 questions was sent to 6000 gynecologists, members of the Sao Paulo Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Results: The response rate was 24.2% (1453 completed questionnaires) with a sample error of 2.23% and confidence level of 95%. Although 95.9% of the respondents were aware of the WHI study, only 24.4% knew of all the other studies mentioned (HERS I, HERS II and Million Women Study). Although 84.6% stated that the results of the WHI study could not be extrapolated to other forms of HT, 23.1% and 25.2%, respectively, stopped prescribing CEE or MPA, 63.7% decreased the dose, 55.2% opted for drugs such as bisphosphonates, tibolone and SERMS, and 46.3% began to prescribe tranquilizers, isoflavone and other natural medications. Moreover, 59.2% agreed that HT should be used for only 4-5 years. Prescriptions decreased significantly for all indications (p < 0.0001). The principal reason for physicians to discontinue HT in a patient was increased risk of breast cancer (62.3%), whereas, according to the physicians, the most important factor for the patients was fear of HT (80.3%). Conclusion: A high percentage of gynecologists in this study knew of the WHI study and followed its recommendations concerning cardiovascular prevention; consequently they changed their management of the treatment of postmenopausal women by restricting indications for HT and decreasing its duration of use and dose. 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Further correlation was obtained between development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells and a concomitant decrease in inducibility of CYP1A and CYP3A drug metabolizing genes. In the present study, a human MDR1 promoter reporter gene construct was designed to investigate the reverse effect in which selected activators of the major CYP (1-3) genes were tested for potential inhibition of transcriptional activity of the MDR1 gene. beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), a potent CYP1A1 inducer, significantly (P < 0.05) down-regulated MDR1 transcriptional activity at 10 muM concentration, causing a 33-fold decrease relative to vector control values. Chemotherapeutic relevance of BNF's transcriptional down-regulation of MDR1 promoter activity was further demonstrated by its restoring 45.86%, and 79.34% drug sensitivity to the resistant MCF-7/Adr cells at 10- and 20 muM concentrations, respectively (P < 0.05). A functional linkage between potent induction of the major CYP (1-3) genes and transcriptional down-regulation of MDR1 gene in drug-resistant tumor cells is hereby hypothesized. Steroid and xenobiotic nuclear receptor (SXR) is proposed to mediate the cross-talk between the two genes and to recruit potent CYP gene inducers as co-repressor ligands in effecting its transcriptional down-regulation of MDR1 gene. Implications for the multidrug resistance phenomenon are discussed. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the soybean and its products have been considered goitrogenic in human and animals. Relatively high levels of dietary soy may have a goitrogenic effect in rodents deficient in dietary iodine. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effects of thyroid function of a daily supplement containing 120 mg of isoflavone (n = 34) versus placebo (n = 20) in 54 premenopausal women (37.3 +4.8 years old). Serum total triiodothyronine (T3), free thyroxine (T4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured at baseline and after 3 months. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected for analysis of isoflavone and iodine. There were no significant difference in serum concentrations of total T3, free T4, or TSH between isoflavone (124.6 +14.7ng/dL, 23.6 + 12.3 pmol/L, and 2.02 + 0.96 mU/L) and the placebo group (124.3 + 16.1 ng/dL, 19.3+4.7pmol/L, and 2.14 + 1.37 mU/L) during the study. Also, there were no significant effects of isoflavone consumption on serum concentration change of thyroid hormone between equol excretors and nonexcretors. When we categorized the isoflavone supplement group into two using the mean concentration of urinary iodine, the insufficent iodine intake group (urinary iodine <100 mug/L, n = 13) and the adequate iodine intake group (>100 mug/L, n = 21), no significant effects of isoflavone on thyroid hormone were observed. However, we may say that the low number of the insufficient iodine intake group included in this study limits the value of this finding. In conclusion, the current study found no significant effects of isoflavones on serum thyroid hormone levels in premenopausal Korean women.",NA,"*female *thyroid gland *thyroid function blood level soybean hormone determination urinalysis thyroid hormone blood level diet Asian human rodent controlled study serum free thyroxine index *isoflavone derivative iodine isoflavone placebo thyrotropin thyroid hormone equol nitrogen 13 liothyronine","S96-S97","17","2007",-1
"1653","1628"," B. Bell, A. Hillard, T. Hillard","The alternative approach: A survey of alternative treatment options in a consultant-led specialist menopause clinic","Introduction. With ongoing controversies regarding the potential risks of conventional hormone replacement therapy (HRT), women are increasingly seeking a more 'natural', less 'medical' alternative to manage their menopause smoothly. In addition, many women on HRT tend to complement their traditional HRT with alternatives, despite the limited evidence about their active ingredients, safety or adverse effects or how they may interact with other therapies. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) has published guidelines on the alternatives to HRT (Alternatives to HRT for the Management of Symptoms of the Menopause, RCOG Scientific Advisory Committee Opinion Paper 6, May 2006). We subsequently undertook a survey in our specialist menopause clinic to investigate what alternatives women were turning to and what evidence there is for these therapies. Methods. A three-month survey was conducted, using patient questionnaires, in a consultant-led specialist menopause clinic. Results. Of the 70 patients who completed the questionnaire, 42 (60%) were not using any complementary treatments. Of these 42, one had tried various alternatives in the past to no effect. Of the 28 women (40%) who were using complementary treatments, 16 (57%) used more than one, 10 (36%) used more than two, and seven (25%) used five or more. Of these 28 women, four (14%) had tried and stopped other therapies in the past. Alternatives included evening primrose oil, cod liver oil, multivitamins, calcium, selenium, glucosamine, soy, acupuncture and shiatsu, among others. SSRIs were being used by three women (4%). Only six (9%) commented on lifestyle measures such as exercise and reduced caffeine and alcohol intake. Co-morbidities in these women included breast cancer, fibromyalgia, osteoporosis and Turner's mosaic. Conclusions. The majority of women attending our clinic are not using alternatives. However, over half of those who do use alternatives use multiple treatments. Menopause International Vol. 13 No. 4 December 2007 201 Most of the alternatives being used were not necessarily those with supportive evidence or recommended by current guidelines. This may reflect the poor efficacy of the treatments and a lack of advice and guidance from professionals. Many women, even those on HRT, wish to explore alternative treatments. It is our responsibility as health-care professionals to be aware of the benefits, risks and interactions of the complementary and alternative treatments our patients may wish to take, so that we can advise them appropriately.",NA,"*menopause *outpatient department *medical specialist *society *consultation female therapy patient risk questionnaire mosaicism health care personnel hormone substitution safety adverse drug reaction college advisory committee responsibility acupuncture Shiatsu lifestyle exercise alcohol consumption morbidity breast cancer fibromyalgia osteoporosis cod liver oil primrose oil multivitamin calcium glucosamine caffeine selenium","200-201","13","2007",-1

Zuo","Treatment with phytoestrogen alpha-zearalanol might protect neurons of hippocampus in ovariectomized rats","Although neuroprotective effects of estrogen on postmenopausal women have been recognized, an associated increased incidence of uterine and breast tumors has jeopardized the clinical use of estrogen. This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of a novel phytoestrogen alpha-zearalanol (alpha-ZAL), on ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Adult Wistar rats were ovariectomized or sham-operated and treatment with equivalent doses of 17beta-estradiol or alpha-ZAL for 5 wk. Uteruses have been weighted and stained by hematoxylin and eosin for morphology analysis. The expression of synaptophysin and parvalbumin in hippocampus were evaluated by immunohistochemistry assays. Our experiments indicated that the synaptophysin and parvalbuminpositive areas were significantly decreased in the OVX group compared to the sham group, alpha-ZAL or 17beta-estradiol administration can reverse the effects. Although alpha-ZAL and 17beta-estradiol treatments reconciled uterus weight loss which was induced by ovariectomy, the effect of alpha-ZAL was less than 17beta-estradiol. This result suggests that alpha-ZAL may effectively abate neurons loss in the hippocampus while slightly promoting weight gain of the uterus. 2006 by Humana Press Inc.

Wong","Activation of insulin-like growth factor I receptor-mediated pathway by ginsenoside Rg1","Ginsenoside Rg1, an active ingredient in ginseng, was previously shown to be a novel class of potent phytoestrogen. The present study aims at investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in mediating its actions in human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. Rg1 (1 pM) stimulates cell proliferation (P<0.01) and estrogen-responsive pS2 mRNA expression (P<0.05) without alteration of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) protein or mRNA expression in MCF-7 cells. In addition, 10-14-10-4 M of Rg1 does not demonstrate specific binding to ERalpha. We hypothesize that Rg1 may exert its actions in MCF-7 cell via the activation of crosstalk between ER- and insulin growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR)-dependent pathways. The results indicate that Rg1 significantly increases IGF-IR expression and IGF-IR promoter activity in MCF-7 cells (P<0.05). Cotreatment of MCF-7 cells with 1 muM of estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 completely abolishes the effects of Rg1 on IGF-IR expression. Furthermore, Rg1 enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in MCF-7 cells upon IGF-I stimulation and the activation of IRS-1 phosphorylation is also ER-dependent. Taken together, our results suggest that Rg1 not only increases IGF-IR expression but also enhances IGF-IR-mediated signaling pathways in MCF-7 cells. The stimulation of IGF-IR expression by Rg1 in MCF-7 cells appears to require ER, and its actions might involve ligand-independent activation of ER. 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",NA,"article binding affinity breast cancer cancer cell cell proliferation cell strain MCF 7 controlled study drug mechanism drug receptor binding embryo estrogen responsive element gene expression human human cell molecular mechanics priority journal promoter region protein expression protein phosphorylation signal transduction stimulation antiestrogen estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] fulvestrant *ginsenoside Rg 1/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] somatomedin C *somatomedin C receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","542-551","147","2006",-1

We have studied the effect of a dietary supplement (verum, administered for 6 weeks) containing plant estrogens, antioxidants, including carotenoids, selenium and other putative prostate cancer inhibiting substances in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study in 37 hormonally untreated men with prostate cancer and increasing PSA levels. Outcome measures were changes in the rates of change of serum concentrations of total and free PSA and changes in male sex hormone levels. Male sex hormone levels were significantly lower during the verum phase (DHT: -0.11 nmol/L, p = 0.005; testosterone: -1 nmol/L, p = 0.02). Total PSA doubling time was unaffected. Free PSA, which increased during the placebo phase (average doubling time of 68 weeks), decreased during the verum period (average half-life of 13 weeks; p = 0.02). In those men in whom the free androgen index decreased (21 out of 32), a significant decrease in the slopes of both total and free PSA was observed (p = 0.04). Overall total PSA doubling times did not increase significantly during verum. However, the study demonstrates that this dietary intervention reduces DHT and testosterone levels and increases free PSA doubling time (and total PSA doubling time in a relevant subgroup). If future studies confirm that these observations translate into a slowing of disease progression, a dietary intervention may become an attractive option for prostate cancer treatment and prevention. 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"adult aged androgen blood level article cancer growth clinical article clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study *diet supplementation double blind procedure human male priority journal *prostate cancer/th [Therapy] randomized controlled trial testosterone blood level treatment outcome alpha tocopherol androgen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *barbipyrine *carotenoid daidzein genestein green tea extract isoflavone derivative lycopene margarine *phytoestrogen phytosterol *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *selenium testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug xanthophyll","835-840","113","2005",-1

The neuroprotective effect of estrogen prompted us to determine potential therapeutic impact of soy-derived estrogenic compounds. Transgenic C. elegans, that express human beta amyloid (Abeta), were fed with soy derived isoflavones genistein, daidzein and glycitein (100 mug/ml) and then examined for Abeta-induced paralysis and the levels of reactive oxygen species. Results: Among the three compounds tested, only glycitein alleviated Abeta expression-induced paralysis in the transgenic C. elegans. This activity of glycitein correlated with a reduced level of hydrogen peroxide in the transgenic C. elegans. In vitro scavenging effects of glycitein on three types of reactive oxygen species confirmed its antioxidant properties. Furthermore, the transgenic C. elegans fed with glycitein exhibited reduced formation of beta amyloid. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a specific soy isoflavone glycitein may suppress Abeta toxicity through combined antioxidative activity and inhibition of Abeta deposition, thus may have therapeutic potential for prevention of Abeta associated neurodegenerative disorders. 2005 Gutierrez-Zepeda et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"antioxidant activity article Caenorhabditis elegans controlled study correlation analysis degenerative disease/pc [Prevention] in vitro study neuroprotection nonhuman oxidative stress paralysis protein expression transgenic organism *amyloid beta protein daidzein/cm [Drug Comparison] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *glycitein/cm [Drug Comparison] *glycitein/pd [Pharmacology] hydrogen peroxide/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] reactive oxygen metabolite/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"6","2005",-1

Rice","Genistein-induced proteome changes in the human endometrial carcinoma cell line, Ishikawa","Epidemiological studies have shown that Asian populations display a lower incidence of hormone-dependant cancers, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and menopausal ailments compared to Western societies. Available data support the proposal that lower incidence is associated with the high dietary consumption of isoflavones, such as genistein. This study used two-dimensional electrophoresis to characterize the effect of genistein on the proteome of an endometrial tumor cell model, namely the Ishikawa cell line. Proteome maps displaying approx 1800 proteins were obtained from cells treated with vehicle or genistein at physiologically attainable concentrations of 0.5, 5, or 50 muM or supra-physiological concentration, 500 muM. The effects of genistein on protein expression were characterized using image analysis software. A total 65 protein spots displayed a significant decrease in expression and 32 proteins displayed a significant increase in expression. Of these protein spots, 29 were randomly selected for characterization by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem mass spectrometry, yielding 18 different proteins. This type of analysis enabled the characterization of a wide range of cellular proteins and allowed for the identification of functional and biochemical pathways that may be regulated or affected by genistein, including cellular transcription, cell proliferation, stress response, or modulation of oncogenic pathways. 2006 Humana Press Inc.",NA,"article *cancer cell culture *cell strain Ishikawa controlled study *endometrium carcinoma human human cell matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry priority journal protein expression proteomics two dimensional electrophoresis *genistein *proteome/ec [Endogenous Compound]","153-167","2","2006",-1
"1673","1643"," S. De Assis, L. Hilakivi-Clarke","Timing of dietary estrogenic exposures and breast cancer risk","The same dietary component, such as fat or phytochemicals in plant foods, can have an opposite effect on breast cancer risk if exposed in utero through a pregnant mother or at puberty. Dietary exposures during pregnancy often have similar effects on breast cancer risk among mothers and their female offspring. High fat intake and obesity are illustrative examples: excessive pregnancy weight gain that increases high birth weight is associated with increased breast cancer risk among mothers and daughters. High bodyweight during childhood is inversely linked to later breast cancer risk. The main reason why the age when dietary exposures occur determines their effect on breast cancer risk likely reflects the extensive programming of the mammary gland during fetal life and subsequent reprogramming at puberty and pregnancy. Programming is a series of epigenetic/transcriptional modifications in gene expression that can be influenced by changes in the hormonal environment induced, for example, by diet. Because epigenetic modifications are inherited by daughter cells, they can persist throughout life if they occur in mammary stem cells or uncommitted mammary myoepithelial or luminal progenitor cells. Our results indicate that the estrogen receptor (ER), mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), and the tumor suppressors BRCA1, p53, and caveolin-1 are among the genes affected by diet-induced alterations in programming/reprogramming. Consequently, mammary gland morphology may be altered in a manner that increases or reduces susceptibility to malignant transformation, including an increase/reduction in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, or in the number of terminal end buds (TEBs) or pregnancy-induced mammary epithelial cells (PI-MECs) that are the sites where breast cancer is initiated. Thus, dietary exposures during pregnancy and puberty may play an important role in determining later risk by inducing epigenetic changes that modify vulnerability to breast cancer. 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.",NA,"body weight *breast cancer breast epithelium *cancer risk cell differentiation cell proliferation cell survival conference paper daughter cell *diet DNA modification epigenetics *estrogen activity fat intake fetus development food composition gene expression genetic transcription high birth weight human mammary gland myoepithelium cell nonhuman obesity pregnancy progeny puberty risk assessment stem cell weight gain BRCA1 protein caveolin 1 estradiol *estrogen/to [Drug Toxicity] *estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] fat genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] mitogen activated protein kinase plant medicinal product protein p53 selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen/to [Drug Toxicity] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] tumor suppressor protein","14-35","1089","2006",-1
"1675","1644"," Y. Hong, S. Chen","Aromatase inhibitors: Structural features and biochemical characterization","Aromatase is the enzyme synthesizing estrogens from androgens. In estrogen-dependent breast tumors, estrogens induce the expression of growth factors responsible for cancer cell proliferation. In situ estrogen synthesis by aromatase is thought to play a key role in the promotion of breast cancer growth. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) provide new approaches for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer by inhibiting estrogen biosynthesis. Through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical techniques, aromatase has been found to be expressed in many endocrine tissues and tumors originating from these tissues. Unexpectedly, this enzyme is now known to also be expressed in liver, lung, and colon cancers. Such findings suggest a potential role for endocrine manipulation of these types of cancer using AIs. Three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved AIs, anastrozole (Arimidex), letrozole (Femara), and exemestane (Aromasin), effectively challenging tamoxifen, have been used as first-line drugs in the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer, and possibly other aromatase-expressing cancers. In addition, natural anti-aromatase chemicals, such as flavones and coumarins, have been identified. Efforts to develop new lines of AIs derived from these phytochemicals have been initiated in several laboratories. Finally, significant progress has been made in the understanding of the structure-function relationship of aromatase. Such information has helped the examination of binding characteristics of AIs, the evaluation of reaction mechanism of aromatase, and the explanation of the molecular basis for a low catalytic activity of the natural variant, M364T. 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.",NA,"adverse outcome antineoplastic activity *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer hormone therapy *cancer prevention catalysis cerebrovascular disease/si [Side Effect] colon cancer conference paper drug mechanism drug tolerability endometrium cancer/si [Side Effect] hormone release hot flush/si [Side Effect] human immunohistochemistry liver cancer lung cancer nonhuman outcome assessment phytochemistry protein expression reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction single nucleotide polymorphism statistical significance *structure activity relation tissue distribution vagina bleeding/si [Side Effect] vagina discharge/si [Side Effect] venous thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] 10 propargylestr 4 ene 3,17 dione/an [Drug Analysis] 10 propargylestr 4 ene 3,17 dione/pd [Pharmacology] 3 (imidazolylmethyl) 4' nitroflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 3 (imidazolylmethyl) 4' nitroflavone/pd [Pharmacology] 4 benzyl 3 (4' chlorophenyl) 7 methoxycoumarin/an [Drug Analysis] 4 benzyl 3 (4' chlorophenyl) 7 methoxycoumarin/pd [Pharmacology] 6 alpha bromoandrostenedione/an [Drug Analysis] 6 alpha bromoandrostenedione/dt [Drug Therapy] 6 alpha bromoandrostenedione/pd [Pharmacology] 7 hydroxy 3 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2 [(4' pyridylmethyl)thio]isoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 7 hydroxy 3 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2 [(4' pyridylmethyl)thio]isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] 7 hydroxyflavanone/an [Drug Analysis] 7 hydroxyflavanone/pd [Pharmacology] 7 hydroxyflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 7 hydroxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] alpha naphthoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] alpha naphthoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] aminoglutethimide/an [Drug Analysis] aminoglutethimide/cm [Drug Comparison] aminoglutethimide/dt [Drug Therapy] aminoglutethimide/pd [Pharmacology] anastrozole/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] anastrozole/an [Drug Analysis] anastrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] anastrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] anastrozole/po [Oral Drug Administration] anastrozole/pd [Pharmacology] androst 4 ene 3,6,17 trione/an [Drug Analysis] androst 4 ene 3,6,17 trione/pd [Pharmacology] androsta 1,4,6 triene 3,17 dione/an [Drug Analysis] androsta 1,4,6 triene 3,17 dione/dt [Drug Therapy] androsta 1,4,6 triene 3,17 dione/pd [Pharmacology] apigenin/an [Drug Analysis] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] aromatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *aromatase inhibitor/an [Drug Analysis] *aromatase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] *aromatase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] baicalein/an [Drug Analysis] baicalein/pd [Pharmacology] chrysin/an [Drug Analysis] chrysin/pd [Pharmacology] coumarin derivative/pd [Pharmacology] equol/an [Drug Analysis] equol/pd [Pharmacology] exemestane/an [Drug Analysis] exemestane/cm [Drug Comparison] exemestane/dt [Drug Therapy] exemestane/po [Oral Drug Administration] exemestane/pd [Pharmacology] fadrozole/an [Drug Analysis] fadrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] fadrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] fadrozole/pd [Pharmacology] flavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] formestane/an [Drug Analysis] formestane/dt [Drug Therapy] formestane/pd [Pharmacology] isolicoflavonol/an [Drug Analysis] isolicoflavonol/pd [Pharmacology] letrozole/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] letrozole/an [Drug Analysis] letrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] letrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] letrozole/po [Oral Drug Administration] letrozole/pd [Pharmacology] naringenin/an [Drug Analysis] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/an [Drug Analysis] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] rotenone/an [Drug Analysis] rotenone/pd [Pharmacology] tamoxifen/cm [Drug Comparison] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug unindexed drug","237-251","1089","2006",-1

The primary purpose of follow-up is often regarded as the early detection of recurrence as well as the detection of second primary tumours. Rather than concentrating solely on detecting cancer recurrence, clinicians need to be more susceptive to symptoms related to treatment morbidity and to the information needs of their patients.

It has been found to possess cancer chemopreventive effects by inhibiting diverse cellular events associated with tumor initiation, promotion, and progression. RES is also a phytoestrogen, which binds to and activates estrogen receptors (ERs) that regulate the transcription of estrogen-responsive target genes. We used two human breast tumor cell lines (MCF7 and MBA-MB-231) and one fibrocystic breast cell line (MCF10a) to examine whether RES altered mRNA expression of genes that are involved in biological pathway frequently altered during carcinogenesis. Two GEarray systems were used to screen the differentially expressed genes between RES-treated cells and control cells. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed further by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Here, we demonstrate that RES regulates mRNA expression of several genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, metastasis, cell-cell adhesion, and ER signaling pathway. This effect of RES on the gene expression appears in correlation with chemoprevention activities of RES described previously. RES is also found to be more active in ER+ than ER- cells.

Lamartiniere","Genistein and resveratrol: Mammary cancer chemoprevention and mechanisms of action in the rat","The environment, including diet, plays a critical role in a woman's subsequent risk of breast cancer. Two dietary polyphenols that have received attention from the health and research communities for their ability to protect against breast cancer are: genistein, a component of soy; and resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in red grapes and red wine. We and others have shown that both genistein and resveratrol can protect against mammary cancer in rodents. The timing of exposure to genistein appears critical for its mammary protective effects. It has been reported that genistein early in life causes enhanced mammary gland differentiation, alterations in cell proliferation and apoptosis, and upregulation of tumor-suppressor genes. With resveratrol in the diet, changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis in terminal ductal structures of the mammary gland might help to explain its protective effects. We conclude that genistein and resveratol can protect against breast cancer by regulating important mammary growth and differentiation pathways. 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.",NA,"antineoplastic activity apoptosis article breast adenocarcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] breast adenocarcinoma/pc [Prevention] *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/et [Etiology] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] breast carcinogenesis cancer growth cancer inhibition *cancer prevention cancer risk cell differentiation cell proliferation combination chemotherapy diet dose response drug efficacy drug potentiation drug receptor binding drug structure drug treatment failure gene control human low drug dose nonhuman protection protein expression risk factor risk reduction signal transduction treatment outcome BRCA1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclooxygenase 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytochrome P450/ec [Endogenous Compound] epidermal growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] gelatinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/an [Drug Analysis] *genistein/cb [Drug Combination] *genistein/do [Drug Dose] *genistein/it [Drug Interaction] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] green tea extract/cb [Drug Combination] green tea extract/dt [Drug Therapy] green tea extract/pd [Pharmacology] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] *resveratrol/an [Drug Analysis] *resveratrol/cb [Drug Combination] *resveratrol/it [Drug Interaction] *resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] *resveratrol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] soybean oil/cb [Drug Combination] soybean oil/dt [Drug Therapy] soybean oil/pd [Pharmacology]","1699-1706","6","2006",-1

The wastewater treatment process consisted of a series of an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and a trickling filter. Samples were collected at each treatment step, and the total estrogenic activity was determined by use of an in vitro gene expression assay (MVLN; MCF-7 human breast cancer cell stably transfected with the pVit-tk-LUC receptor plasmid). Individual estrogenic compounds were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). To further identify the compounds contributing to the estrogenic activity in the wastewater, the sample extracts were fractionated into 12 fractions (fractions 1-12) by HPLC. The rate of removal of estrogenic activity between the effluent and the influent was greater than 97%. The trickling filter removed the majority of the estrogenic activity. The removal rates of specific estrogenic compounds ranged from 44 to 99%. Estrogenic activity was detected mainly in the fractions containing estrone (E1), 17beta-estradiol (betaE2), 17alpha-estradiol (alphaE2), estriol (E3), bisphenol A (BPA), and equol (EQO). The ratios of betaE2-EQC (betaE2 equivalents derived from chemical analysis) to betaE2-EQB (betaE2 equivalent derived from bioassay) in the 12 fractions collectively were contributed by E1 (17-30%), betaE2 (23-30%), alphaE2 (< 1%), E3 (1-2%), BPA (< 1%), and EQO (2-3%) in the influent and E1 (16-37%), betaE2 (< 1-7%), alphaE2 (< 1%), E3 (< 1-3%), BPA (<1%), and EQO (<1%) in the effluent.

A low use of fibres, the intake of red meat and an imbalance of Omega-3 and Omega-6 fats may contribute to increase the risk of cancer. On the other hand, the assumption of lots of fruit and vegetables may lower the risk of cancer. Protective elements in a cancer-preventive diet include selenium, folic acid, vitamin B 12, vitamin D, chlorophyll and antioxidants such as carotenoids (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, cryptoxanthin). Ascorbic acid has limited benefits if taken orally, but it effective through intravenous injection. A supplementary use of oral digestive enzymes and probiotics is also an anticancer dietary measure.

They may then be troubled with vasomotor symptoms or dyspareunia, and concerned about skeletal conservation. Use of standard pharmacopoeia and alternative and complementary therapies are discussed. Options for treating vasomotor symptoms include progestogens, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and gabapentin. Clonidine and propranolol are ineffective. For the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, the options are bisphosphonates, strontium ranelate, raloxifene and parathyroid hormone. It is important to note that most studies have been undertaken in elderly women with osteoporosis or at increased risk of the disease and the placebo group received calcium supplements. There is little information about the use of these agents in young women, particularly those with premature menopause. There is little scientific evidence that complementary and alternative therapies can help menopausal symptoms or provide the same benefits as conventional therapies, yet many women use them, believing them to be safer and 'more natural'. The choice of treatments is confusing and, unlike conventional medicines, not much is known about their active ingredients, safety and side-effects, or how they may interact with other therapies. They can interfere with warfarin, antidepressants and anti-epilpetics, with potentially fatal consequences. Some herbal preparations may contain estrogenic compounds, and this is a concern for women with hormone-dependent disease such as breast cancer.

Antimitotic drug, KSP inhibitor","In the search for novel mitotic targets for the development of antineoplastic agents, Homo sapiens Eg5 kinesin spindle protein (KSP, HsEg5/KSP) was identified. KSP is a member of a subfamily of kinesins that are involved in centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation during mitosis. It has been shown to function exclusively in mitosis and is preferentially overexpressed in malignant cells. Inhibition of KSP interferes with the formation of the bipolar spindle required for proper separation and lining of chromosomes during mitosis, which ultimately leads to cell death. KSP inhibitors may therefore effectively interfere with mitosis while showing an improved therapeutic index. Ispinesib mesilate (715992, SB-715992, formerly CK-0238273) is one such KSP inhibitor that was found to be more selective for KSP over other members of the kinesin family.

Dushenkov","Polymethoxylated flavones induce Ca2+-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells","Flavonoids, polyphenolic phytochemicals which include flavones and isoflavones, are present in the common human diet. It has been suggested that these compounds may exert anticancer activity; however, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. We have recently shown (Sergeev, 2004, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 321: 462-467) that isoflavones can activate the novel apoptotic pathway mediated by cellular Ca2+. Here, we report that polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) derived from sweet orange (Citrus sinensis L.) inhibit growth of human breast cancer cells via Ca2+-dependent apoptotic mechanism. The treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,8,3',4'-hexamethoxyflavone (5-OH-HxMF) and 3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,4'-tetramethoxyflavone (3'-OH-TtMF) induced a sustained increase in concentration of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) resulting from both depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. This increase in [Ca2+]i was associated with the activation of the Ca2+-dependent apoptotic proteases, mu-calpain and caspase-12, as evaluated with the calpain and caspase-12 peptide substrates and antibodies to active (cleaved) forms of the enzymes. Corresponding non-hydroxylated PMFs, 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone (HpMF) and 5,6,7,3',4'-pentamethoxyflavone (PtMF), were dramatically less active in inducing Ca2+-mediated apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest that the cellular Ca2+ modulating activity of flavonoids underlies their apoptotic mechanism and that hydroxylation of PMFs is critical for their ability to induce an increase in [Ca2+]i and, thus, activate Ca2+-dependent apoptotic proteases. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Hormonal replacement, which has been the cornerstone therapy of menopausal related symptoms for decades, recently has been shown to increase breast cancer incidence as well as risk of recurrence and no longer should be recommended. Menopausal symptoms and complications such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and osteoporosis leading to fractures have a negative impact on the quality of life of both breast cancer survivors and the general postmenopausal population.

"1703","1671"," J. Blake","Menopause: evidence-based practice","Menopause is a physiologic transition and is assuming an increasing importance as the demographic bulge moves through this phase. The transition takes place over several years. It is characterized by depletion of the ovarian follicles, decreasing inhibin leading to increases in follicle-stimulating hormone and loss of the menstrual cycle, accompanied by decreased estradiol production and typical symptoms. The role of hormone therapy in menopause has shifted from preventive use to a limited role in symptom management, for which it remains the most effective intervention. There is good evidence from observational and randomized trials of an increased risk of breast cancer in women on estrogen plus a progestin, compared with those on estrogen alone. There are insufficient data to be able to determine if there are clinically important differences between various progestins and progesterone with respect to breast cancer risk, nor between different regimens. Even relatively short-term exposure to unopposed estrogen will increase the risk of atypical endometrial hyperplasia or cancer; women who have their uterus should be using a progestational agent. Lifestyle changes at menopause are important and effective for preventive health. Recent evidence suggests that the discordance between epidemiologic studies with respect to cardiovascular outcomes and the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial (WHI RCT) data might be attributable in large part to the older age of women enrolled in the WHI. 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Klocker","The flavonoid apigenin inhibits the proliferation of prostatic stromal cells via the MAPK-pathway and cell-cycle arrest in G1/S","Introduction: Phytoestrogen apigenin, a member of flavonoids, has been described for its ability to induce growth arrest in carcinomas of colon, breast and prostate. In order to identify its influence on the prostatic stroma, which plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), we investigated the effect of apigenin on cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression. Methods: Prostatic stromal cells were isolated from nonmalignant tissue specimens obtained from patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. After incubation with increasing concentrations of apigenin for 24, 48 and 72 h the cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Cell-cycle regulation was examined by FACS analysis and the expression level of proteins involved in the G1/S transition was determined by immunoblot analysis. Results: Apigenin treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of proliferation starting at a concentration of 30 muM of the flavonoid. FACS analysis showed cell-cycle arrest at a G1/S transition point. Furthermore, apigenin modified the expression levels of cell-cycle regulatory proteins leading to a dose-dependent decrease of cyclin D1 and an increase of p21/WAF1 expression, as determined by immunoblot analysis. As apigenin lead to a decrease of the phosphorylation status of ERK1 and 2, we postulated that the mechanism of apigenin action is mediated through mitogen activated kinases (MAPK)-pathway. Conclusion: Taken together, in response to apigenin treatment prostatic stromal cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, which may be due to a cell-cycle growth arrest and seems to occur via MAPK-pathway. These results suggest possible beneficial effects of apigenin in the prevention and/or treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"1709","1680"," T. A. H. Jarvinen, E. T. Liu","Simultaneous amplification of HER-2 (ERBB2) and topoisomerase IIalpha (TOP2A) genes - Molecular basis for combination chemotherapy in cancer","The HER-2 (also known as ERBB2/ErbB2/c-erbB2/HER-2/neu) oncogene is the most frequently amplified oncogene in breast cancer and is also amplified in other forms of cancer. Beside its important role in tumor induction, growth and progression, HER-2 is also a target for new therapeutic approaches such as Herceptin (trastuzumab), a recombinant antibody designed to block signaling through the HER-2 receptor. In addition to Herceptin, which is in a wide clinical use for HER-2 amplified breast cancer, a number of various HER-2 directed immunological and genetic strategies, either targeting the HER-2 receptor, its signaling pathways or both HER-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) simultaneously, have demonstrated promising pre-clinical activity in HER-2 amplified carcinomas. Moreover, the HER-2 amplicon is known to contain more than 30 genes with altered copy numbers that could be therapeutic targets for chemotherapy. The topoisomerase IIalpha gene, TOP2A, is located adjacent to the HER-2 oncogene at the chromosome location 17q12-q21 and is either amplified or deleted (with equal frequency) in a great majority of HER-2 amplified primary breast tumors and also in tumors without HER-2 amplification. Recent experimental as well as numerous, large, multi-center trials suggest that amplification (and/or deletion) of TOP2A may account for both sensitivity or resistance to commonly used cytotoxic drugs, i.e. topoII-inhibitors (anthracyclines etc.), depending on the specific genetic defect at the TOP2A locus. The understanding of HER-2 amplification and its role in the pathogenesis of cancer is expanding, and a number of therapeutic strategies targeting either the HER-2 or its signaling pathways in cancer therapy are being investigated. Combining HER-2 targeting therapies with conventional forms of cytotoxic chemotherapy, where additional diagnostic tests such as those ascertaining TOP2A status, may be helpful for the ideal selection of patients for the combination therapy of an HER-2 targeting drug together with a cytotoxic drug such as topoII-inhibitor especially in the case of TOP2A amplification. 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/et [Etiology] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer combination chemotherapy cancer growth carcinogenesis cardiotoxicity/si [Side Effect] chromosome 17q clinical trial drug potentiation fluorescence in situ hybridization gene amplification gene deletion gene expression gene location gene repression gene targeting gene therapy gene transfer heart disease/si [Side Effect] human meta analysis nonhuman oncogene neu review signal transduction suicide gene therapy systematic review tumor growth unspecified side effect/si [Side Effect] vaccination anthracycline/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] anthracycline/cb [Drug Combination] anthracycline/dt [Drug Therapy] anthracycline/pd [Pharmacology] antisense oligodeoxynucleotide/cb [Drug Combination] antisense oligodeoxynucleotide/it [Drug Interaction] antisense oligodeoxynucleotide/pd [Pharmacology] curcumin/dt [Drug Therapy] curcumin/pd [Pharmacology] cyclophosphamide/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] cyclophosphamide/ct [Clinical Trial] cyclophosphamide/cb [Drug Combination] cyclophosphamide/dt [Drug Therapy] cytosine deaminase/dt [Drug Therapy] cytosine deaminase/tu [Intratumoral Drug Administration] cytosine deaminase/pd [Pharmacology] cytotoxic agent/cb [Drug Combination] cytotoxic agent/it [Drug Interaction] cytotoxic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] decorin/dt [Drug Therapy] decorin/pd [Pharmacology] *DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing)/ec [Endogenous Compound] *DNA topoisomerase IIalpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] DNA topoisomerase inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] DNA topoisomerase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] DNA topoisomerase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] DNA topoisomerase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] DNA vaccine/dt [Drug Therapy] DNA vaccine/pd [Pharmacology] emodin/dt [Drug Therapy] emodin/pd [Pharmacology] *epidermal growth factor receptor 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] epirubicin/ct [Clinical Trial] epirubicin/cb [Drug Combination] epirubicin/it [Drug Interaction] epirubicin/dt [Drug Therapy] fluorouracil/ct [Clinical Trial] fluorouracil/cb [Drug Combination] fluorouracil/it [Drug Interaction] fluorouracil/dt [Drug Therapy] gamma linolenic acid/cb [Drug Combination] gamma linolenic acid/it [Drug Interaction] gamma linolenic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] gamma linolenic acid/pd [Pharmacology] gefitinib/ct [Clinical Trial] gefitinib/dt [Drug Therapy] gefitinib/pd [Pharmacology] geldanamycin/ct [Clinical Trial] geldanamycin/dt [Drug Therapy] geldanamycin/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *gyrase inhibitor/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *gyrase inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] *gyrase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] *gyrase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] immunotoxin/cb [Drug Combination] immunotoxin/dv [Drug Development] immunotoxin/dt [Drug Therapy] interleukin 12/dt [Drug Therapy] interleukin 12/pd [Pharmacology] omega 6 fatty acid/cb [Drug Combination] omega 6 fatty acid/it [Drug Interaction] omega 6 fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] omega 6 fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology] paclitaxel/ct [Clinical Trial] paclitaxel/cb [Drug Combination] paclitaxel/it [Drug Interaction] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] single chain fragment variable antibody/ct [Clinical Trial] single chain fragment variable antibody/tu [Intratumoral Drug Administration] single chain fragment variable antibody/pd [Pharmacology] small interfering RNA/pd [Pharmacology] trastuzumab/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] trastuzumab/ct [Clinical Trial] trastuzumab/cb [Drug Combination] trastuzumab/it [Drug Interaction] trastuzumab/dt [Drug Therapy] trastuzumab/pd [Pharmacology] tumor vaccine/dt [Drug Therapy] unclassified drug unindexed drug","579-602","6","2006",-1

Pommier","Activation of aminoflavone (NSC 686288) by a sulfotransferase is required for the antiproliferative effect of the drug and for induction of histone -H2AX","Aminoflavone (AF) is entering clinical trials. We recently reported that AF induces DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) and -H2AX in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. To elucidate the mechanism of action of AF and provide biomarkers indicative of AF activity, we correlated AF activity profile (GI50) with gene expression patterns in the NCI-60 cell lines. Sulfotransferases (SULT) showed the highest positive correlation coefficients among ~ 14,000 probe sets analyzed (r = 0.537, P < 0.001). Stable transfection of SULT1A1 into AF-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells sensitized these cells to AF. AF produced DPCs, -H2AX foci, and S-phase arrest in the SULT1A1-transfected but not in the parent MDA-MB-231 cells. Conversely, cells in which SULT1A1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA failed to induce -H2AX. Inhibition of SULTs and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes by natural flavonoids blocked the antiproliferative activity of AF and the formation of AF-DNA adducts. AF also induces SULT1A1 and CYP expression in MCF-7 cells, suggesting the existence of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated positive feedback for AF activation by CYP and SULT1A1. Metabolism studies showed that AF can be oxidized by CYP at two amino groups to form N-hydroxyl metabolites that are substrates for bioactivation by SULTs.

This review is an evidence-based evaluation of herbs and supplements for these conditions. Therapies that carry a higher level of support from randomized controlled trial evidence include black cohosh for menopause; vitamins B1 and E for dysmenorrhea; calcium, vitamin B6, and chasteberry for premenstrual syndrome; and chasteberry for cyclic mastalgia. There were too few trials involving herbs and supplements in infertility to warrant a solid recommendation, but chasteberry, antioxidants, and Fertility Blend have some preliminary support.

Methods: A VacA (+) and CagA (+) standard H pylori line NCTC 11637 and a human gastric adenocarcinoma derived gastric epithelial cell line BGC-823 were applied in the study. MTT assay and 3H-TdR incorporation test were used to detect the proliferation of BGC-823 cells and Western blotting was used to detect the activity and existence of related proteins. Results: Incubation with H pylori extract increased the proliferation of gastric epithelial cells, reflected by both live cell number and DNA synthesis rate. The activity of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signal transduction cascade increased within 20 min after incubation with H pylori extract and appeared to be a sustained event. MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 abolished the action of H pylori extract on both ERK activity and cell proliferation. Incubation with H pylori extract increased c-Fos expression and SRE-dependent gene expression. H pylori extract caused phosphorylation of several proteins including a protein with molecular size of 97.4 kDa and tyrosine Winase inhibitor genistein inhibited the activation of ERK and the proliferation of cells caused by Hpylori extract.

Stearns","Chemoprevention of breast cancer: Tamoxifen, raloxifene, and beyond","Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death among women in the United States. While nonrandomized studies have reported that prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy can significantly reduce the risk of breast cancer, these approaches are unacceptable to the majority of women. Chemoprevention, which is defined as the prevention of cancer by pharmacological agents that inhibit or reverse the process of carcinogenesis, has thus increasingly become the focus of breast cancer prevention efforts. The first-generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen is the only US Food and Drug Administration- approved drug for breast cancer prevention and reduces the risk of breast cancer by as much as 50% in high-risk women. Raloxifene, a second-generation SERM, also has demonstrated efficacy for breast cancer prevention and is being compared with tamoxifen in a large randomized trial that has recently completed accrual. The aromatase inhibitors (AIs) decrease the incidence of contralateral breast cancer when used in the adjuvant setting and are being evaluated in ongoing primary prevention studies. In addition, a number of novel agents, including antiinflammatory drugs and retinoid derivatives, which appear to be of promise based on preclinical and epidemiological data, are under investigation. Several important challenges remain, including determination of the appropriate dose and duration of treatment when used in the primary prevention setting and development of new research models using surrogate end points for breast cancer incidence and mortality to permit more rapid clinical application of promising new agents. 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",NA,"arthralgia/si [Side Effect] *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *cancer chemotherapy cancer incidence cancer mortality cancer survival carcinogenesis cerebrovascular disease/si [Side Effect] *chemoprophylaxis clinical trial drug efficacy drug induced cancer/si [Side Effect] drug safety endometrium cancer/si [Side Effect] food and drug administration fracture/si [Side Effect] heart disease/si [Side Effect] hot flush/si [Side Effect] human mastectomy meta analysis musculoskeletal disease/si [Side Effect] myalgia/si [Side Effect] priority journal review risk assessment systematic review thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] vagina bleeding/si [Side Effect] vagina discharge/si [Side Effect] acetylsalicylic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] anastrozole/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] anastrozole/ct [Clinical Trial] anastrozole/cb [Drug Combination] anastrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] anastrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] anastrozole/pd [Pharmacology] aromatase inhibitor/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] aromatase inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] aromatase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] aromatase inhibitor/cm [Drug Comparison] aromatase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] aromatase inhibitor/po [Oral Drug Administration] aromatase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] celecoxib/ct [Clinical Trial] celecoxib/dt [Drug Therapy] celecoxib/pd [Pharmacology] conjugated linoleic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] docosahexaenoic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] eflornithine/ct [Clinical Trial] eflornithine/dt [Drug Therapy] eflornithine/pd [Pharmacology] exemestane/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] exemestane/ct [Clinical Trial] exemestane/cm [Drug Comparison] exemestane/dt [Drug Therapy] exemestane/pd [Pharmacology] fenretinide/ct [Clinical Trial] fenretinide/cb [Drug Combination] fenretinide/dt [Drug Therapy] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] ibuprofen/dt [Drug Therapy] icosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] letrozole/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] letrozole/ct [Clinical Trial] letrozole/cm [Drug Comparison] letrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] letrozole/pd [Pharmacology] nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent/dt [Drug Therapy] nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent/pd [Pharmacology] omega 3 fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma antagonist/dt [Drug Therapy] perphenazine/dt [Drug Therapy] *raloxifene/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *raloxifene/ct [Clinical Trial] *raloxifene/cm [Drug Comparison] *raloxifene/do [Drug Dose] *raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] *raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] retinoid/ct [Clinical Trial] retinoid/dt [Drug Therapy] retinoid/pd [Pharmacology] selective estrogen receptor modulator/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] selective estrogen receptor modulator/ct [Clinical Trial] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] selenium/dt [Drug Therapy] sphingolipid/dt [Drug Therapy] *tamoxifen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *tamoxifen/ct [Clinical Trial] *tamoxifen/cb [Drug Combination] *tamoxifen/cm [Drug Comparison] *tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] *tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] triterpenoid/dt [Drug Therapy] unindexed drug vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy]","337-348","13","2006",-1

Although the prevalence of CAM use in this population is becoming apparent, few researchers have examined the relationship between CAM use and lifestyle factors that could influence patients' well-being. The present study examined whether breast cancer survivors who use biologically based CAM are more likely than CAM nonusers to follow a low-fat diet and maintain moderate or vigorous exercise. Sixty-five female breast cancer survivors who were within 3 months of completing primary treatment were recruited. CAM use was measured by self-reported use of one or more of a list of 15 supplements. Dietary fat was measured by a 23-item self-report measure estimating fat consumption in the past month. Dietary fat stage of change and moderate and vigorous exercise stage of change were assessed using measures based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. Results showed that biologically based CAM users maintained a lower percentage of calories from fat in their diet (t=2.12, p<0.05), and there was a trend for CAM users to be more likely than CAM nonusers to be in the action or maintenance stage for dietary fat consumption (p<0.09). However, this study did not find that CAM users were more likely to be in the action or maintenance stage of change for moderate or vigorous exercise. These findings suggest that biologically based CAM use among breast cancer survivors is associated with some, but not all, healthy lifestyle behaviors.

This review provides an evidence-based survey of some popular dietary supplements or nutraceuticals targeting a variety of endocrine disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of thyroid extracts or other natural remedies for thyroid disease is not evidence-based and is not superior to synthetic preparations. Insufficient data support the use of dehydroepiandrosterone or ginkgo biloba for hormonal disorders. Black cohosh and isoflavones may alleviate menopausal symptoms. Weak clinical data support the well tolerated use of several dietary supplements or nutraceuticals in diabetology, including a variety of botanicals and chromium. Carnitine and alpha-lipoic acid may alleviate diabetic neuropathy. Vitamin E is not a cardiovascular protectant. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids improve certain dyslipidemias. Data regarding conjugated linoleic acid and obesity are inconclusive. Isoflavones and vitamin K1 are promising but still unproven agents in osteoporosis, whereas the use of calcium and vitamin D alone has recently been challenged.

"1737","1710"," J. Lunn, H. E. Theobald","The health effects of dietary unsaturated fatty acids","Fat provides energy; indeed it is the most energy dense of all the macronutrients, with 1g providing 37 kJ (9 kcal). However, the constituent parts of fat, fatty acids, are required by the body for many other functions than simply as an energy source, and there is an increasing awareness of the potential health benefits of specific types of fatty acids. Fatty acids are long hydrocarbon chains, with a methyl group at one end (the omega or n-end) and an acid group at the other. Unsaturated fatty acids are hydrocarbon chains containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond; monounsaturated fatty acids contain one double bond, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) contain many double bonds. The position of the double bond relative to the omega end determines whether a PUFA is an n-3 (omega 3) or an n-6 (omega 6) fatty acid. Most fatty acids can be synthesised in the body, but humans lack the enzymes required to produce two fatty acids. These are called the essential fatty acids and must be acquired from the diet. In humans, the essential fatty acids are the n-3 PUFA alpha-linolenic acid and the n-6 PUFA linoleic acid. Although humans can elongate dietary alpha-linolenic acid to the long chain n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, the rate of synthesis may not be sufficient to meet requirements, and it is, therefore, recommended that good sources of these fatty acids, namely, oil-rich fish, are also included in the diet. Fat is found in most food groups, and foods containing fat generally provide a range of different fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated. In the UK, the major dietary sources of unsaturated fatty acids include meat & meat products, cereals & cereal products and potatoes & savoury snacks; primarily as a result of the vegetable oil used in processing. Recommended intakes of both total fat and the different types of fatty acids have been set for the UK population, and it is possible to monitor fat intake from the data collected in nationwide dietary surveys. As a population, we are not currently meeting these recommendations, so there is still scope for dietary change. In Western diets, n-6 fatty acids are the predominant PUFAs, and this is in line with current dietary advice to consume a minimum of 1% energy as n-6 PUFAs and 0.2% energy as n-3 PUFAs. The balance of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in Western diets has changed substantially over the last 100 years or so, and as the two families of PUFAs share a common metabolic pathway, concerns have been raised that this might be detrimental to health; what is becoming increasingly clear is that both n-3 and n-6 PUFAs have independent health effects in the body, and as intakes of the n-6 PUFAs are within the guidelines for a healthy diet, concerns about the n-6 to n-3 ratio are driven by low intakes of n-3 rather than high intakes of n-6. Currently in adults n-6 PUFAs contribute to 5.3% energy. Detecting associations between components of the diet and risk of various diseases is notoriously complex and in many cases, the evidence is still accumulating. Cardiovascular disease, characterised by hardening and narrowing of blood vessels and/or the development of blood clots, is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The type and total amount of dietary fat has a clear part to play in affecting an individual's disease risk, yet the precise mechanisms by which unsaturated fatty acids reduce cardiovascular disease risk are still unclear. A number of mechanisms whereby dietary fatty acids could influence the progression of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors have been identified. These include effects on blood lipid concentrations, blood pressure, inflammatory response, arrhythmia and endothelial function, along with many other effects, both known and as yet undefined. A well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease is an elevated plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration. Replacing saturated fatty acids with either monounsaturated fatty acids or n-6 PUFAs reduces LDL (the 'bad') cholest rol, and so reduces the risk of developing the disease. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic acid or monounsaturated fatty acids, also slightly raise high density lipoprotein (HDL) (the 'good') cholesterol, which assists in the removal of triacylglycerols from the bloodstream. Interest in the health effects of the long chain n-3 PUFAs found in fish oils is also increasing. There is strong supportive, but not yet conclusive, evidence that these fatty acids protect against fatal heart disease. On the basis of this conclusion, in 2004 the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition advised the UK government to adopt the population-wide dietary recommendation to eat at least two portions of fish per week, of which one should be oil-rich, equivalent to 0.45 g of the long chain n-3 PUFAs per day. In recent years, the potential health benefits of alpha-linolenic acid has attracted attention, and evidence is mounting on the role that this n-3 fatty acid may play in preventing the progression of cardiovascular disease, although it is currently unclear what, if any, association exists. Brain cells are especially rich in certain long chain PUFAs. This has led to the suggestion that dietary status of these long chain fatty acids might influence cognitive function and behaviour. Research in this field is still in its early stages, but there is a small amount of evidence to suggest improvements in cognitive function following fatty acid supplementation. In contrast, it is well established that pregnant women must have an adequate supply of the long chain n-3 PUFAs before and throughout pregnancy and lactation to support normal growth, neurological development and cognitive function of the baby. As n-6 PUFAs are more abundant in the diet, achieving an adequate intake is less problematic. However, this is not the case for the n-3 PUFAs; increasing fish consumption beyond two servings of oil-rich fish per week or relying on fish oil supplementation is not appropriate during pregnancy due to the potential problems associated with heavy metal contamination of fish, or the high vitamin A level in some fish oil supplements. Unsaturated fatty acids have also been associated with a number of other diseases and although the evidence is by no means conclusive, it is an area that is attracting a huge amount of interest. Dietary fat affects a number of different metabolic pathways, including those involved with glycaemic control, so the types and amounts of dietary fat may have a role to play in the management of type 2 diabetes. Unsaturated fatty acids may also be associated with a reduced risk of developing certain cancers, including cancers of the colon, breast and prostate, although currently the level of evidence is not deemed sufficient by authoritative bodies, such as the World Cancer Research Fund, World Health Organization and the Department of Health, to make any specific dietary recommendations. There are a number of inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, Crohn's disease and arthritis, which could potentially be alleviated by dietary modification. The fatty acid composition of cell membranes can be altered by consumption of both n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, and this can result in reduced inflammatory activity. However, whether this effect brings about a significant reduction in clinical symptoms is still unclear. It is also important to note that there are concerns that the beneficial effects on certain disease outcomes are only observed with very high intakes of unsaturated fatty acids, which could realistically only be achievable by supplementation. Few nutritionists would be comfortable recommending supplement use as the only alternative to fish, as this can be expensive and goes against the idea that all the nutrients that our bodies require can be obtained from the food that we eat if the right choices are made. Unsaturated fatty acids are now a nutritional hot topic, and their presence in foods has attracted both public and industrial interest. There is currently no specific legislation to control the use of health claims relating to he fatty acid content of foods. However, a European Union (EU) Directive is expected imminently which will formally set down the criteria that a product will have to meet in order to make any nutrition or health claim. With regards to the current recommendations, those for the UK are in line with those around the world. However, as a population, we need to increase our consumption of long chain n-3 PUFAs and decrease intake of saturated fatty acids. To facilitate this, food technologists are looking at ways in which the fatty acid profile of a food can be modified in order to bring dietary improvements without requiring a major change in dietary habits. However, public health messages surrounding the optimum intakes of fatty acids must be clear and consistent to ensure that a favourable change in the fatty acid profile of the UK diet occurs. 2006 British Nutrition Foundation.",NA,"antiinflammatory activity antineoplastic activity arthritis/dt [Drug Therapy] arthritis/ep [Epidemiology] arthritis/et [Etiology] arthritis/pc [Prevention] article asthma/dt [Drug Therapy] asthma/et [Etiology] asthma/pc [Prevention] breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] caloric intake cardiovascular disease/dt [Drug Therapy] cardiovascular disease/ep [Epidemiology] cardiovascular disease/et [Etiology] cardiovascular disease/pc [Prevention] cardiovascular risk cereal cerebrovascular accident/dt [Drug Therapy] cerebrovascular accident/ep [Epidemiology] cerebrovascular accident/et [Etiology] cerebrovascular accident/pc [Prevention] child development child nutrition cholesterol blood level clinical trial cognition colon cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] colon cancer/pc [Prevention] Crohn disease/dt [Drug Therapy] Crohn disease/et [Etiology] Crohn disease/pc [Prevention] diet supplementation dose response drug megadose fast food fat content *fat intake fatty acid synthesis fetus development fibrinolysis food processing heart arrhythmia/dt [Drug Therapy] heart arrhythmia/pc [Prevention] heart infarction/dt [Drug Therapy] heart infarction/pc [Prevention] heart protection human incidence ischemic heart disease/dt [Drug Therapy] ischemic heart disease/ep [Epidemiology] ischemic heart disease/et [Etiology] ischemic heart disease/pc [Prevention] meat meta analysis non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus/et [Etiology] non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus/pc [Prevention] nonhuman nutritional value potato pregnancy primary prevention priority journal prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] risk factor risk reduction systematic review thrombogenesis United Kingdom antiinflammatory agent/dt [Drug Therapy] corticosteroid/dt [Drug Therapy] docosahexaenoic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] docosahexaenoic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] docosahexaenoic acid/pd [Pharmacology] essential fatty acid/ct [Clinical Trial] essential fatty acid/cm [Drug Comparison] essential fatty acid/do [Drug Dose] essential fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] essential fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology] fish oil/ct [Clinical Trial] fish oil/cm [Drug Comparison] fish oil/do [Drug Dose] fish oil/dt [Drug Therapy] fish oil/pd [Pharmacology] high density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] icosapentaenoic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] icosapentaenoic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] icosapentaenoic acid/pd [Pharmacology] immunosuppressive agent/dt [Drug Therapy] linoleic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] linoleic acid/cm [Drug Comparison] linoleic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] linoleic acid/pd [Pharmacology] linolenic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] linolenic acid/cm [Drug Comparison] linolenic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] linolenic acid/pd [Pharmacology] low density lipoprotein cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] monounsaturated fatty acid/ct [Clinical Trial] monounsaturated fatty acid/cm [Drug Comparison] monounsaturated fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] monounsaturated fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology] oleic acid/cm [Drug Comparison] oleic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] oleic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] oleic acid/pd [Pharmacology] omega 3 fatty acid/ct [Clinical Trial] omega 3 fatty acid/cm [Drug Comparison] omega 3 fatty acid/do [Drug Dose] omega 3 fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] omega 3 fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology] omega 6 fatty acid/ct [Clinical Trial] omega 6 fatty acid/cm [Drug Comparison] omega 6 fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] omega 6 fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology] placebo polyunsaturated fatty acid/ct [Clinical Trial] polyunsaturated fatty acid/cm [Drug Comparison] polyunsaturated fatty acid/do [Drug Dose] polyunsaturated fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] polyunsaturated fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology] saturated fatty acid/cm [Drug Comparison] saturated fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] saturated fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology] soybean oil/ct [Clinical Trial] soybean oil/dt [Drug Therapy] stearic acid/ec [Endogenous Compound] *unsaturated fatty acid/ct [Clinical Trial] *unsaturated fatty acid/cm [Drug Comparison] *unsaturated fatty acid/do [Drug Dose] *unsaturated fatty acid/dt [Drug Therapy] *unsaturated fatty acid/pd [Pharmacology]","178-224","31","2006",-1

Translocations affecting the breakpoint cluster region of the MLL gene at chromosome band 11q23 are the most common molecular genetic aberrations in leukemias associated with the topoisomerase II poisons. These agents perturb the cleavage-religation equilibrium of topoisomerase II and increase cleavage complexes. One model suggests that this damages the DNA directly and leads to chromosomal breakage, which may result in untoward DNA recombination in the form of translocations. This review will summarize the evidence for topoisomerase II involvement in the genesis of translocations and extension of the model to acute leukemia in infants characterized by similar MLL translocations. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To address this concern we evaluated the effects of high-dose isoflavonoid supplements on reproductive tissues in a postmenopausal primate model. Thirty adult female ovariectomized monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were randomized to receive a control diet 1) alone, 2) with 509 mg/day of the soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein (IF), or 3) with 1020 mg/day of racemic equol (EQ), an isoflavan, for approximately 1 mo. Doses are expressed in aglycone units as calorically scaled human equivalents. Total serum isoflavonoid levels 4 h postfeeding were <20 nmol/L, 2570.7 nmol/L, and 6944.8 nmol/L for control, IF, and EQ groups, respectively. Equol was the predominant serum isoflavonoid in both IF (72.5%) and EQ (99.7%) groups. Aglycones represented 0.9% (IF) and 0.5% (EQ) of total serum isoflavonoids. Histologically, uteri and mammary glands were diffusely atrophic in all groups. Uterine weight, endometrial thickness, glandular area, and epithelial proliferation in the uterus were not significantly different among treatment groups (ANOVA P > 0.1 for all). Endometrial progesterone receptor gene expression was significantly increased in the IF group (P = 0.02), while protein expression was not altered (ANOVA P > 0.1). Within the mammary gland, proliferation and indicators of estrogen exposure did not differ among treatment groups (ANOVA P > 0.1 for all). These findings indicate that high doses of dietary soy isoflavonoids have minimal uterotrophic or mammotrophic effects in an established primate model. 2006 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue article breast carcinogenesis cancer risk cell culture cell proliferation controlled study diet supplementation dose response endometrium estrogen activity female *female genital system gene expression gene expression regulation Macaca mammary gland nonhuman nucleotide sequence ovariectomy postmenopause priority journal protein expression racemic mixture sexual development *soybean uterus uterus weight aglycone daidzein *equol estrogen genistein isoflavan derivative *isoflavone isoflavonoid progesterone receptor","477-486","75","2006",1

Wood","Hormonal effects on the mammary gland of postmenopausal nonhuman primates","Macaques are Old World anthropoid primates with a high degree of genetic identity to human beings and striking similarities in breast development, reproductive endocrinology, and menstrual cycle characteristics. These animals share critical pathways of hormone metabolism with humans, to a degree that is distinct from rodent models. Macaques also express estrogen receptors alpha and beta, progesterone receptors, and androgen receptors in the normal breast in patterns similar to those described for women. Spontaneously occurring hormone-dependent breast cancers occur in macaques at a similar prevalence to lower-risk populations of women, and these neoplasms exhibit similar growth patterns and key molecular changes seen in human lesions. These similarities lend support to a biomarker approach for modeling breast cancer risk. Estrogen+progestogen treatment of postmenopausal animals produces a proliferative response in the normal breast epithelium which reflects the breast cancer promoting effects of continuous combined hormone replacement therapy. Studies of novel agents such as tibolone, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and alternative progestogens in macaques have also helped to identify hormonal therapies with a more acceptable balance of benefit to risk. Future studies of novel selective estrogens, androgens, and dietary estrogens in the macaque model will further contribute to our understanding of breast cancer risk and prevention. 2005,2006 IOS Press.

Fisher","Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (mda-7)/ interleukin-24 (IL-24), mda-7/IL-24: Current perspectives on a unique member of the IL-10 family of cytokines","Developing effective and safe therapies for cancer continues to be a primary objective of both basic researchers and clinicians. However, despite evidence of progress in treating specific tumors, in many instances, especially in the context of metastasis, no effective therapies are available. A focus of our laboratories is to develop improved cancer therapeutics that exploit differences in signaling pathways and gene expression in tumor versus normal cells. An approach, which we have pioneered, is the use of 'differentiation therapy' combined with subtraction hybridization, DISH (differentiation induction subtraction hybridization), to define genes that are relevant to cancer growth control, differentiation and apoptosis. Application of DISH to human melanoma cells permitted the cloning of melanoma differentiation associated (mda) genes that display elevated expression as a function of induction of terminal differentiation and loss of tumorigenic potential in cancer cells. One mda gene, mda-7, has emerged as a potential therapeutic for cancer because of its unique ability to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells, without affecting normal cells. Based on structure, location and properties, mda-7, a cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family, is now designated as IL-24. mda-7/IL-24 exhibits multiple levels of anti-cancer effects that include inhibition of angiogenesis, radiosensitization and potent antitumor bystander activities. As a cytokine it also demonstrates immunostimulatory properties. An adenovirus expressing mda-7/IL-24, INGN 241, has entered the clinic and been shown to be safe and display significant activity toward solid tumors, including melanoma, in a Phase I clinical trial.

Bennett","Essiac and Flor-Essence herbal tonics stimulate the in vitro growth of human breast cancer cells","Background. People diagnosed with cancer often self-administer complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) to supplement their conventional treatments, improve health, or prevent recurrence. Flor-Essence and Essiac Herbal Tonics are commercially available complex mixtures of herbal extracts sold as dietary supplements and used by cancer patients based on anecdotal evidence that they can treat or prevent disease. In this study, we evaluated Flor-Essence and Essiac for their effects on the growth of human tumor cells in culture. Methods. The effect of Flor-Essence and Essiac herbal tonics on cell proliferation was tested in MCF-7, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, and T47D cancer cells isolated from human breast tumors. Estrogen receptor (ER) dependent activation of a luciferase reporter construct was tested in MCF-7 cells. Specific binding to the ER was tested using an ICI 182,780 competition assay. Results. Flor-Essence and Essiac herbal tonics at 1%, 2%, 4% and 8% stimulated cell proliferation relative to untreated controls in both estrogen receptor positive (MCF-7 and T47D) and estrogen receptor negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436) cell lines. Exposure to the tonics also produced a dose-dependent increase in ER dependent luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells. A 10-7 M concentration of ICI 182,780 inhibited the induction of ER dependent luciferase activity by Flor-Essence and Essiac, but did not affect cell proliferation. Conclusion. Flor-Essence and Essiac Herbal Tonics can stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cells through ER mediated as well as ER independent mechanisms of action.

In this study, we investigated the effect of genistein pretreatment on the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) in both estrogen receptor-positive (MCF-7) and -negative (MDA-MB-231) cells. Genistein increased the expression of GRP78 in a dose- and time-dependent manner and suppressed glucose uptake in both cell lines. However, induction of GRP78 by genistein appears not to be directly associated with inhibition of glucose uptake. Genistein treatment also made MDA-MB-231 cells more sensitive to doxorubicin, probably via increased GRP78 expression, but had no effect or even decreased drug sensitivity in MCF-7 cells. These results suggest that genistein may be exploited as an enhancer of chemotherapeutic agents in certain types of breast cancer.

These therapies are increasingly popular among women seeking alternatives to treatment with estrogen for managing menopausal symptoms. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of complementary and alternative therapies in the management of menopausal symptoms. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library database, MANTIS, and AMED. Study Selection: Full-text, English-language, randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses comparing a complementary or alternative therapy with placebo or control for treatment of menopausal symptoms. Data Extraction: All eligible trials were reviewed, abstracted into evidence tables, and rated for quality. Data Synthesis: Seventy randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria. Forty-eight studies of phytoestrogens and other biologically based agents showed mixed results. Smaller numbers of studies using mind-body, energy, manipulative, and body-based therapies and whole medical systems showed little benefit in treating menopausal symptoms. Conclusions: Although individual trials suggest benefits from certain therapies, data are insufficient to support the effectiveness of any complementary and alternative therapy in this review for the management of menopausal symptoms. Many of these potential therapies warrant further study in trials with rigorous scientific designs to determine benefit and safety. 2006 American Medical Association.

Chen","Purification and characterization of a fibrinolytic enzyme of Bacillus subtilis DC33, isolated from Chinese traditional Douchi","Bacillus subtilis DC33 producing a novel fibrinolytic enzyme was isolated from Ba-bao Douchi, a traditional soybean-fermented food in China. The strong fibrin-specific enzyme subtilisin FS33 was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using the combination of various chromatographic steps. The optimum temperature, pH value, and pI of subtilisin FS33 were 55degreeC, 8.0, and 8.7, respectively. The molecular weight was 30 kDa measured by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. The enzyme showed a level of fibrinolytic activity that was about six times higher than that of subtilisin Carlsberg. The first 15 amino acid residues of N-terminal sequence of the enzyme were A-Q-S-V-P-Y-G-I-P-Q-I-K-A-P-A, which are different from that of other known fibrinolytic enzymes. The amidolytic activities of subtilisin FS33 were inhibited completely by 5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), but 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), beta-mercaptoethanol, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate (PHMB) did not affect the enzyme activity; serine and tryptophan are thus essential in the active site of the enzyme. The highest affinity of subtilisin FS33 was towards N-Succ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA. Therefore, the enzyme was considered to be a subtilisin-like serine protease. The fibrinolytic enzyme had a high degrading activity for the Bbeta-chains and Aalpha-chain of fibrin(ogen), and also acted on thrombotic and fibrinolytic factors of blood, such as plasminogen, urokinase, thrombin, and kallikrein. So subtilisin FS33 was able to degrade fibrin clots in two ways, i.e., (a) by forming active plasmin from plasminogen and (b) by direct fibrinolysis.

Feldman","Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) down-regulates androgen receptor expression and diminishes androgenic responses in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells","The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Targeting the AR for down-regulation would be a useful strategy for treating prostate cancer, especially hormone-refractory or androgen-independent prostate cancer. In the present study, we showed that the antiestrogen fulvestrant [ICI 182,780 (ICI)] effectively suppressed AR expression in several human prostate cancer cells, including androgen-independent cells. In LNCaP cells, ICI (10 mumol/L) treatment decreased AR mRNA expression by 43% after 24 hours and AR protein expression by ~ 50% after 48 hours. We further examined the mechanism of AR down-regulation by ICI in LNCaP cells. ICI did not bind to the T877A-mutant AR present in the LNCaP cells nor did it promote proteasomal degradation of the AR. ICI did not affect AR mRNA or protein half-life. However, ICI decreased the activity of an AR promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid transfected into LNCaP cells, suggesting a direct repression of AR gene transcription. As a result of AR down-regulation by ICI, androgen induction of prostate-specific antigen mRNA and protein expression were substantially attenuated. Importantly, LNCaP cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by ICI treatment. Following 6 days of ICI treatment, a 70% growth inhibition was seen in androgen-stimulated LNCaP cells. These data show that the antiestrogen ICI is a potent AR down-regulator that causes significant inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth. Our study suggests that AR down-regulation by ICI would be an effective strategy for the treatment of all prostate cancer, especially AR-dependent androgen-independent prostate cancer.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the chronic effects of dietary phytoestrogens, genistein (8 mg kg-1 day-1) and beta-sitosterol (50 mg kg-1 day-1), on the weight regulation of the mink (Mustela vison). The parental generation was exposed from August 2002 to May-June 2003 to either beta-sitosterol or genistein, while the kits were exposed through gestation and lactation. Food consumption and body masses were monitored monthly. Plasma lipid, glucose, total protein and hormone (ghrelin, leptin, triiodothyronine and thyroxine) concentrations were measured from the parents in August 2002, January 2003 and at the end of the experiment in May-June 2003 when the kits were 21 days of age. Relative food intake was higher in the beta-sitosterol-exposed minks than in the control or genistein minks in September 2002. Plasma leptin and total protein concentrations were lower in the beta-sitosterol kits compared to the control kits. Furthermore, plasma ghrelin levels and liver phosphorylase activities of the mink kits were higher due to genistein exposure. In mink kits, exposure to both phytoestrogens reduced the plasma thyroxine concentrations. The kidney glycogen concentrations and the muscle phosphorylase activities of phytoestrogen-treated adult minks were elevated. The results of this study suggest that minks are sensitive to perinatal phytoestrogen exposure. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, the effects of genistein on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in MCR-7 cells with HER-2/neu expression were further studied for exploring the molecular mechanism of anti-angiogenesis in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer by genistein. Methods: HER-2/neu-overexpressing MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/HER-2) were established by transfecting HER-2/neu gene into HER-2/neu negative expression breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Immunocytochemical staining, western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were adopted to measure the expression of VEGF in MCF-7/HER-2 cells treated by genistein for 24, 48 and 72h. Results: HER-2/neu expression up-regulated VEGF mRNA and protein in MCF-7 cells, genistein decreased VEGF mRNA and protein level in MCF-7/HER-2 cells in a time-dependent manner.

"1763","1736"," Y. Yamori","Food factors for atherosclerosis prevention: Asian perspective derived from analyses of worldwide dietary biomarkers","Worldwide epidemiological surveys covering 61 populations in 25 countries have shown that fish and soybean diets contribute to healthy longevity through the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the Japanese population, particularly in Okinawans who consume a lot of fish and soy products. This is supported by the finding that 24 h urinary excretions of taurine and isoflavones, which are rich in fish and soybeans, are inversely related to mortality rates of coronary artery disease (CAD). Immigrant studies of Okinawans in Hawaii (USA) and Brazil showed that dietary factors were more important determinants of cardiovascular diseases than genetic factors. Intervention studies in these immigrants and Scottish people, whose CAD mortality rates are among the highest in the world, confirmed that diets fortified with fish oil (docosahexaenoic acid) and soy protein (isoflavone) alleviated the risks of CAD and osteoporosis. Asian eating patterns, consisting of daily seafood and/or soy consumption, confer protection against CAD despite a Westernized life style; moreover, dietary biomarkers indicate that approximately 100 g of soybean curd (tofu) or fish may contribute to lower CAD mortality, as low as that found among the Japanese. 2006 Pulsus Group Inc.

The rapid responses occur without participation of the genome, and are therefore termed nongenomic. Some of the estrogen induced effects acutely modulate vascular function and may contribute to the gender difference in cardiovascular susceptibility. While some actions may be mediated by novel, nonclassic receptors, the classic estrogen receptor has been shown to also act on signalling cascades. There are sparse examples for compounds structurally related to the endogenous hormone estradiol that bind to the estrogen receptor but may selectively elicit nongenomic responses. The further development of such selectively acting drugs holds much promise for better therapies with fewer side effects, e.g. for vascular malfunction, but also for estrogen-dependent cancer. 2006.",NA,"article autocrine effect blood vessel tone *breast cancer cancer cell culture cardiovascular symptom clinical research coronary artery blood flow drug structure *estrogen activity human postmenopause premenopause receptor intrinsic activity structure analysis acolbifene/pd [Pharmacology] antiestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein endothelial nitric oxide synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estradiol/an [Drug Analysis] *estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] ethinylestradiol/pd [Pharmacology] fulvestrant/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology]","321-326","54","2006",-1

South Asian migrants in the UK have a lower incidence of hormone-related cancer than their hosts but the extent to which this difference may be due to phytoestrogen intake is not known. The aim was to compare habitual phytoestrogen intake in first-generation South Asian migrant women and native British women. South Asian (n 221) and native British women (n 50) were recruited from general practitioner lists and were asked to provide monthly 24 h recalls for a period of 1 year. An enhanced phytoestrogen database was compiled using data from a literature search and unpublished data. A sub-sample of South Asian women (n 100) and the native British women (n 40) also provided blood samples every 3 months during the 1-year period. The median daily intakes (mug/d) of isoflavones (184.2 v. 333.9) and lignans (110.8 v. 148.8) were significantly lower in South Asians than in the native British (P < 0.001, P = 0.04 respectively). There were no significant differences in mean plasma isoflavone levels (nmol/l) but plasma enterolactone was significantly lower in the South Asians (13.9 (SD17.5) v. 28.5 (SD23.3), P<0.001). The main sources of phytoestrogens were bread and vegetables in both ethnic groups. Habitual phytoestrogen intake in South Asian and native British women was below 1 mg/d and was higher in the native British diet.

SULT1A1 catalyzes the sulfation of small planar phenols such as neurotransmitters, steroid hormones, acetaminophen, and p-nitrophenol (PNP). Genetic polymorphisms in the human SULT1A1 gene define three alleles, SULT1A1*1, *2, and *3. The enzyme activities of the SULT1A1 allozymes were studied with a variety of substrates, including PNP, 17beta-estradiol, 2-methoxyestradiol, catecholestrogens, the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), and dietary flavonoids. Using purified recombinant SULT1A1 protein, marked differences in *1, *2, and *3 activity toward every substrate studied were noted. Substrate inhibition was observed for most substrates. In general, the trend in Vmax estimates was *1 > *3 > *2; however, Vmax/Km estimate trends varied with substrate. In MCF-7 cells stably expressing either SULT1A1*1 or *2, the antiestrogenic response to OHT was found to be allele-specific: the cells expressing *2 exhibited a better antiproliferative response. The intracellular stability of the *1 and *2 allozymes was examined in insect as well as mammalian cells. The SULT1A1*2 protein had a shorter half-life than the *1 protein. In addition, the *2 protein was ubiquitinated to a greater extent than *1, suggesting increased degradation via a proteasome pathway. The results of this study suggest marked differences in activity of polymorphic SULT1A1 variants, including SULT1A1*3, toward a variety of substrates. These differences are potentially critical for understanding interindividual variability in drug response and toxicity, as well as cancer risk and incidence.

Elhelw","Non-hormonal therapies for the treatment of menopausal symptoms","Hot flushes affect approximately 75% of postmenopausal women and are one of the most distressing symptoms that women experience as they enter the menopause.The treatment of hot flushes is a common clinical challenge. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) effectively reduces vasomotor symptoms by 80-90%, however, many patients may be unable or unwilling to undergo hormonal treatment. Publication of the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Million Women Study (MWS) has led to considerable uncertainties about the role of HRT among health professionals and women. The estrogen and progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative and other recent reports suggest that HRT may increase the risk for coronary heart disease events, strokes, venous thromboembolism, and invasive breast cancer. Many expert groups recommend that combination hormonal therapy for the management of vasomotor symptoms should be limited to the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and benefits versus risks for individual women. All of these concerns have generated interest in non-hormonal treatment of hot flushes. Such therapies, readily available for the menopausal patient could become a therapeutic nightmare -especially when taken without physician supervision. Data for these therapies are limited, and most of the studies have been conducted in women with a history of breast cancer. In this review we discuss the evidence underlying the commonly used non-hormonal therapies for hot flushes in terms of efficacy and safety.

Boutron-Ruault","Dietary and cancer-related behaviors of vitamin/mineral dietary supplement users in a large cohort of French women","Background: Several epidemiological studies suggested an association between vitamin/mineral dietary supplement use and cancer risk. However, characteristics of supplement users may themselves be related to cancer risk, and therefore could confound such etiological studies. Very little is known about the characteristics of French supplement users. Aim of the study: To identify cancer-related behaviors and dietary characteristics of vitamin/mineral supplement users in the E3N cohort of French women. Methods: Data on supplement use and cancer-related and socio-demographic characteristics were collected by self-administered questionnaires completed by 83,058 women, 67,229 of whom also completed a food frequency questionnaire. Supplement users were compared to non-users by unconditional logistic regression. Results: Vitamin/mineral supplement users were significantly older and leaner (odds ratio [OR] for BMI > 30 vs. < 18.5 kg/m2 = 0.35, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.39), were less often current smokers, had a higher level of education and had more leisure physical activity. They used more phytooestrogen supplements (OR = 3.95, 95 % CI 3.69-4.23), had more often a family history of breast cancer and had more often undergone cancer-screening. Users tended to have a healthier diet: less alcohol, more vegetables, fruit, dairy products, fish and soups. They had higher dietary intakes for most micro-nutrients, fiber and 3 fatty acids, lower fat intake and either similar or lower prevalence of inadequate dietary intake for all relevant nutrients except magnesium. Conclusions: To avoid major confounding, the lifestyle characteristics of supplement users should be considered in studies investigating the association between supplement use and cancer risk.

"1785","1763"," A. M. Whelan, T. M. Jurgens, S. K. Bowles","Natural health products in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials","BACKGROUND: Consumers are increasingly looking to natural health products to manage specific diseases such as osteoporosis. As a result, healthcare providers need evidence-based information on which to base recommendations regarding use and efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To identify natural health products (NHPs, ie, dietary supplements) advocated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and systematically review the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the effect of NHPs on bone mineral density (BMD)/fracture rate in women. METHODS: MEDLINE, Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database, and the Internet were initially searched to identify NHPs advocated for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. For NHPs having evidence to support their claim, the aforementioned sources, along with International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, the Cochrane Library, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health, and HerbMed, were searched to locate randomized controlled trials published in English between 1966 and October 2004. Bibliographies of identified articles were also searched. Randomized controlled trials were selected if they evaluated the use of a single NHP in women, using BMD/fracture rate as the outcome measure. NHPs were excluded from further evaluation if a review had already been published. Data were extracted using predetermined criteria and studies appraised using the Jadad scale. Forty-five NHPs were identified that the authors claimed to be beneficial in prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, with 15 having evidence to support their claim. Calcium; copper; evening primrose oil; fish oils; fluoride; magnesium; manganese; strontium; vitamin D; and black, green, and oolong tea did not meet study criteria. RESULTS: Results from randomized controlled trials evaluating dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), phytoestrogens, and vitamin K2 (menaquinone or menatetrenone) were promising; however, study limitations suggest the need for confirmatory evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn, the relative safety of phytoestrogens, DHEA, and vitamin K2 at the studied doses, as well as preliminary positive results from randomized controlled trials, provides some initial support for the use of these NHPs in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in women.",NA,"abdominal distension/si [Side Effect] acne/si [Side Effect] alfalfa Althaea Angelica sinensis arthralgia/si [Side Effect] avocado black pepper bone density bone mineral bone pain/si [Side Effect] breast cancer/si [Side Effect] breast disease/si [Side Effect] cabbage Cimicifuga racemosa clinical trial constipation/si [Side Effect] controlled clinical trial dandelion diarrhea/si [Side Effect] *diet supplementation drug efficacy drug safety dyspnea/si [Side Effect] edema/si [Side Effect] Equisetum fatigue/si [Side Effect] flatulence/si [Side Effect] fluid retention ginseng Glycyrrhiza headache/si [Side Effect] herbal medicine hirsutism/si [Side Effect] human hypertension/si [Side Effect] malaise/si [Side Effect] menopausal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] menstruation disorder/si [Side Effect] nausea/si [Side Effect] *osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] *osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] papaya phytotherapy postmenopause osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] postmenopause osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] priority journal pruritus/si [Side Effect] randomized controlled trial review Rumex skin irritation/si [Side Effect] sleep disorder/si [Side Effect] stomach irritation/si [Side Effect] systematic review tea thorax pain/si [Side Effect] treatment outcome tumor/si [Side Effect] vomiting/si [Side Effect] biochanin A/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] biochanin A/do [Drug Dose] biochanin A/dt [Drug Therapy] biochanin A/po [Oral Drug Administration] black tea extract/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium/do [Drug Dose] calcium/dt [Drug Therapy] chondroitin/dt [Drug Therapy] conjugated estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] conjugated estrogen/do [Drug Dose] conjugated estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] daidzein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] daidzein/do [Drug Dose] daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] daidzein/po [Oral Drug Administration] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol plus norethisterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] etidronic acid/do [Drug Dose] etidronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] farnoquinone/do [Drug Dose] farnoquinone/it [Drug Interaction] farnoquinone/dt [Drug Therapy] fish oil/dt [Drug Therapy] folic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] formononetin/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] formononetin/do [Drug Dose] formononetin/dt [Drug Therapy] formononetin/po [Oral Drug Administration] genistein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] genistein/do [Drug Dose] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/po [Oral Drug Administration] glycitein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] glycitein/do [Drug Dose] glycitein/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *isoflavone/do [Drug Dose] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone/po [Oral Drug Administration] isoflavone derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] isoflavone derivative/do [Drug Dose] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/po [Oral Drug Administration] medroxyprogesterone acetate/cb [Drug Combination] medroxyprogesterone acetate/do [Drug Dose] medroxyprogesterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] melatonin/dt [Drug Therapy] menatetrenone/do [Drug Dose] menatetrenone/it [Drug Interaction] menatetrenone/dt [Drug Therapy] *natural product/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *natural product/do [Drug Dose] *natural product/dt [Drug Therapy] *natural product/po [Oral Drug Administration] *phytoestrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *phytoestrogen/do [Drug Dose] *phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *phytoestrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] *prasterone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *prasterone/do [Drug Dose] *prasterone/dt [Drug Therapy] *prasterone/po [Oral Drug Administration] primrose oil/dt [Drug Therapy] progesterone/dt [Drug Therapy] progesterone/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] *soybean protein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *soybean protein/do [Drug Dose] *soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] *soybean protein/po [Oral Drug Administration] unindexed drug vitamin D/do [Drug Dose] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin K group/do [Drug Dose] vitamin K group/it [Drug Interaction] vitamin K group/dt [Drug Therapy] warfarin/it [Drug Interaction]","836-849","40","2006",-1

Part 4","A number of 2-(furan-2-yl)-4-phenoxyquinoline derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for anti-inflammatory evaluation. 4-[(2-Furan-2-yl)quinolin-4-yloxy]benzaldehyde (8), with an IC50 value of 5.0 muM against beta-glucuronidase release, was more potent than its tricyclic furo[2,3-b]quinoline isomer 3a (>30 muM), its 4'-COMe counterpart 7 (7.5 muM), and its oxime derivative 13a (11.4 muM) and methyloxime derivative 13b (>30 muM). For the inhibition of lysozyme release, however, oxime derivative 12a (8.9 muM) and methyloxime derivative 12b (10.4 muM) are more potent than their ketone precursor 7 and their respective tricyclic furo[2,3-b]quinoline counterparts 4a and 4b.

(E)-1-{3-[(2-Furan-2-yl)quinolin-4-yloxy]phenyl}ethanone oxime (11a) is capable of inhibiting both lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase release with IC50 values of 7.1 and 9.5 muM, respectively. For the inhibition of TNF-alpha formation, 1-{3-[(2-furan-2-yl)quinolin-4-yloxy]phenyl}ethanone (6) is the most potent with an IC50 value of 2.3 muM which is more potent than genistein (9.1 muM). For the inhibitory activity of fMLP-induced superoxide anion generation, 11a (2.7 muM), 11b (2.8 muM), and 13b (2.2 muM) are three of the most active.

A universal experience in women's aging, it is the culmination of many years of reproductive aging; a process that unfolds as a continuum from birth through ovarian senescence to the menopausal transition and the postmenopause. The menopausal transition is known to play a major role in the etiology of many symptoms common in middle age and may contribute to chronic conditions and disorders of aging such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Recent data suggest an unacceptable increase in morbidity in a number of women using hormone therapy (HT). Thus, during the past few years, many women and doctors have revised their opinions on HT for menopause-related symptoms, and a substantial number of individuals have discontinued its use because of concerns about side-effects, owing to this, numerous alternatives to HT are promoted, and researches have pointed out the interest in a group of molecules such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (i.e. raloxifene) and phytoestrogens. Further studies may open a new panorama in patient-specific management of postmenopausal health.

Petritsch","Prostatic phyto-oestrogen tissue levels in different Austrian regions","Introduction: A number of studies suggest that the low incidence of prostate cancer as well as benign prostatic enlargement in Asia depends on the extended consumption of phyto-oestrogens in these parts of the world. In most Asian men, phyto-oestrogen levels are multiple higher compared to Austrian (European) men. The aim of our study was to evaluate, according to the East-West decline, whether there were significant differences within the Austrian population. We compared prostate phyto-oestrogen tissue levels of men living in three different geographical regions of Austria. We further compared men living in rural and urban environments. Material and Methods: Prostatic tissue samples of 103 men undergoing surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer were collected and frozen at -40degreeC. In tissue samples, enterolactone (representative for lignans) and genistein levels (representative for isoflavones) were determined in duplicate by monoclonal antibody-based immunoassays. We subsequently compared tissue levels of men living in rural and urban environments and different geographical regions of Austria. Results: Prostatic enterolactone tissue levels were similar in men living in an urban (median 19.1 ng/g dry weight, range 1.5-76.4) or rural environment (median 15.7 range 0.6-140.6) p = 0.99. The respective values for genistein were 20.5 ng/g dry weight (range 4.6-47.4) and 9.3 (range 0.1-156.7) p = 0.77. Furthermore, enterolactone (p = 0.1) and genistein (p = 0.65) levels were similar in three different geographic regions in Austria. Conclusion: No significant differences regarding genistein and enterolactone were found between our study populations. However, we found a wide variation between individual patients.

Haegeman","Attenuation of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1-driven nuclear factor-B gene expression by soy isoflavones does not require estrogenic activity","We have analyzed in molecular detail how soy isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) suppress nuclear factor-B (NF-B)-driven interleukin-6 (IL6) expression. In addition to its physiologic immune function as an acute stress cytokine, sustained elevated expression levels of IL6 promote chronic inflammatory disorders, aging frailty, and tumorigenesis. Our results in estrogen-unresponsive fibroblasts, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) knockout cells, and estrogen receptor (ER)-deficient breast tumor cells show that phytoestrogenic isoflavones can selectively block nuclear NF-B transactivation of specific target genes (in particular IL6), independently of their estrogenic activity. This occurs via attenuation of mitogen-activated protein/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and ERK activity, which further down-regulates MSK-dependent NF-B p65 and histone H3 phosphorylation. As constitutive NF-B and MSK activity are hallmarks of aggressive metastatic ER-deficient breast cancer, the MSK signaling pathway may become an attractive target for chemotherapy. 2006 American Association for Cancer Research.",NA,"aging animal cell animal experiment animal model article attenuation *breast cancer carcinogenesis chromatin chronic inflammation down regulation drug effect estrogen activity fibroblast gene control gene expression gene induction gene targeting human mouse nonhuman priority journal protein phosphorylation reporter gene soybean stress *biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] cytokine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] histone acetyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] histone deacetylase/ec [Endogenous Compound] histone H3/ec [Endogenous Compound] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] interleukin 6/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] mitogen activated protein kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] stress activated protein kinase 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] tumor necrosis factor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","4852-4862","66","2006",-1

"1801","1775"," S. Verdier-Sevrain, F. Bonte, B. Gilchrest","Biology of estrogens in skin: Implications for skin aging","Estrogens have a profound influence on skin. The relative hypoestrogenism that accompanies menopause exacerbates the deleterious effects of both intrinsic and environmental aging. Estrogens clearly have a key role in skin aging homeostasis as evidenced by the accelerated decline in skin appearance seen in the perimenopausal years. Estrogens improve skin in many ways. Among these, they increase collagen content and skin thickness and improve skin moisture. However, despite the knowledge that estrogens have such important effects on skin, the cellular and subcellular sites and mechanisms of estrogen action are still poorly understood. Estrogen receptors (ERs) have been detected in skin, and recent studies suggest that estrogens exert their effect in skin through the same molecular pathways used in other non-reproductive tissues. Although systemic hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been used for many years, recent trials have reported a significant increased risk of breast cancer and other pathologies with this treatment. This has led to reconsider the risks and benefits of HRT. For this reason, systemic HRT cannot be recommended today to treat skin aging. Currently, intensive research is conducted to develop new drugs called selective ER modulators (SERMs). These drugs exert mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects depending on the tissue and cell type. One might expect in the future such a drug targeting specifically the skin without systemic side effects.

Clarke","Meta-analysis of soy intake and breast cancer risk","Background: High intake of soy foods has been proposed to contribute to the low breast cancer risk in Asian countries. However, results of epidemiologic studies of this association are highly variable, and experimental data suggest that soy constituents can be estrogenic and potentially risk enhancing. Thus, rigorous evaluation of available epidemiologic data is necessary before appropriate recommendations can be made, especially for women at high risk of breast cancer or those who have survived the disease. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of 18 epidemiologic studies (12 case-control and six cohort or nested case-control) published from 1978 through 2004 that examined soy exposure and breast cancer risk. Pooled relative risk estimates were based on either the original soy exposure measure defined in each study or on an estimate of daily soy protein intake. Results: Risk estimates, levels and measures of soy exposure, and control for confounding factors varied considerably across studies. In a pooled analysis, among all women, high soy intake was modestly associated with reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 0.99); the association was not statistically significant among women in Asian countries (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.12). Among the 10 studies that stratified by menopausal status the inverse association between soy exposure and breast cancer risk was somewhat stronger in premenopausal women (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.85) than in postmenopausal women (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.98); however, eight studies did not provide menopause-specific results, six of which did not support an association. When exposure was analyzed by soy protein intake in grams per day, a statistically significant association with breast cancer risk was seen only among premenopausal women (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.92 to 0.97). Conclusions: Soy intake may be associated with a small reduction in breast cancer risk. However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to potential exposure misclassification, confounding, and lack of a dose response. Given these caveats and results of some experimental studies that suggest adverse effects from soy constituents, recommendations for high-dose isoflavone supplementation to prevent breast cancer or prevent its recurrence are premature. 2006 Oxford University Press.",NA,"article Asian *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer recurrence cancer risk case control study clinical trial cohort analysis confidence interval drug megadose experimental design exposure female human menopause meta analysis postmenopause premenopause priority journal protein intake publishing quantitative analysis risk reduction statistical significance systematic review unspecified side effect/si [Side Effect] daidzein/cm [Drug Comparison] daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/do [Drug Dose] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] isoflavone derivative/do [Drug Dose] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] *soybean protein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *soybean protein/ct [Clinical Trial] *soybean protein/cm [Drug Comparison] *soybean protein/do [Drug Dose] *soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy]","459-471","98","2006",-1

After excluding the principal confounding factors, traffic policemen were matched with controls by age, working life, body mass index (BMI), drinking habit, and habitual soy intake in diet. One hundred and ten traffic policemen and 110 controls were included in the study. In male traffic policemen, mean androstenedione values were significantly lower compared to controls. The distribution of androstenedione values in traffic policemen and in controls was significant. Our results suggest that the occupational exposure to chemical urban stressors, interacting with and adding to the psychosocial ones, could alter androstenedione plasma concentrations in traffic policemen compared to a control group. According to our previous research, androstenedione could be used as an early biological marker, valuable for the group to be employed in occupational settings, even before the onset of the endocrine reproductive health diseases.

Design: Individual compounds in the preformulated (i.e., no excipients present) extract were identified by either chemical isolation followed by structure elucidation or matching to retention time and molecular mass of chemical standards via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. Quantitation of the amounts of compounds found in the preformulated extract was done using HPLC-UV or LC-MS. Isolated compounds or standards were evaluated for their ability to: (1) induce alkaline phosphatase (AP) in an endometrial carcinoma cell line, (2) competitively bind to recombinant human estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha (a) and beta (beta), and (3) act as antioxidants by scavenging 2,2-di(4-tert-octylphenyl)-1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radicals. Results: The preformulated red clover extract had 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 2.0 to 2.2 mug/mL in the AP estrogenicity assay, and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50s) of 18.4 to 32.6 mug/mL and 1.9 to 3.4 mug/mL in the ERalpha and ERbeta binding assays, respectively. The preformulated extract was composed of 35.54% isoflavones, 1.11% flavonoids, 0.06% pterocarpans, <0.03% coumarins, and <0.03% tyramine. Daidzein, genistein, formononetin, biochanin A, coumestrol, and naringenin were estrogenic in the AP assay, and all of these, except formononetin, bound to one or both ERs. Conclusions: The major and minor chemical and active estrogenic components of a preformulated phase II red clover clinical extract were identified, quantitatively measured, and the final capsule doses were calculated. The extract is currently under evaluation in a year-long clinical study for the alleviation of menopausal hot flashes.

Wuttke","Effects of 8-prenylnaringenin on the hypotalamo-pituitary-uterine axis in rat after 3-month treatment","Phytoestrogens are increasingly consumed in artificially high doses as herbal preparations and nutritional supplements. The flavanone 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN) is a potent phytoestrogen, but its benefits and risks after long-term application are poorly identified. Therefore, we tested two doses of 8PN and 17beta-estradiol-3-benzoate (E2B) (effective doses: 6.8 and 68.4 mg/kg body weight (BW) of 8PN, and 0.17 and 0.7 mg/kg BW of 17beta-estradiol (E2)) and compared their effects on uterine weight, pituitary hormones (LH, FSH and prolactin) and the expression of estrogen-regulated genes and of estrogen receptor (ER)alpha and ERbeta in the hypothalamus, pituitary and uterus. Both doses of E2 and the high dose of 8PN suppressed serum LH and FSH, and stimulated serum prolactin levels, uterine weight, and progesterone receptor, insulin-like growth factor I and complement protein C3 mRNA transcripts. In the preoptic and the mediobasal areas of the hypothalamus, all treatments had negligible effects on ERalpha and ERbeta and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor gene expression, while ERbeta and GnRH receptor transcripts in the anterior pituitary were reduced under both E2 doses and the high 8PN dose. The mRNA concentrations of the LHalpha and -beta subunits in the pituitary were suppressed by E2 and 8PN. In summary, 8PN had very similar though milder effects than E2 on all tested parameters. Inhibition of climacteric complaints by E2 takes place in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits the overactive GnRH pulse generator. Hence, 8PN may be used to inhibit climacteric symptoms effectively. Human pharmacologic studies will show whether the stimulatory effect on the uterus that was found in the present animal model would require the concomitant administration of progestins to prevent endometrial overstimulation. 2006 Society for Endocrinology.",NA,"animal experiment animal model article controlled study dose response drug efficacy drug megadose endometrium follitropin blood level gene expression regulation hormonal regulation hormone inhibition *hypothalamus hypophysis gonad system low drug dose luteinizing hormone blood level menopausal syndrome/pc [Prevention] nonhuman ovary hyperstimulation/pc [Prevention] priority journal prolactin blood level reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction uterus weight *8 prenylnaringenin/cm [Drug Comparison] *8 prenylnaringenin/do [Drug Dose] *8 prenylnaringenin/pd [Pharmacology] complement component C3/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol benzoate/cm [Drug Comparison] estradiol benzoate/do [Drug Dose] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] follitropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] gonadorelin/ec [Endogenous Compound] luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] *phytoestrogen/do [Drug Dose] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] prolactin/ec [Endogenous Compound] somatomedin C/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug","397-405","188","2006",-1
"1811","1789"," G. Rieck, A. Fiander","The effect of lifestyle factors on gynaecological cancer","Several lifestyle factors affect a woman's risk of gynaecological cancer and - potentially - can be modified to reduce risk. This chapter summarises the evidence for the effect of lifestyle factors on the incidence of gynaecological malignancy. The incidence of obesity is increasing in the developed world such that it now contributes as much as smoking to overall cancer deaths. Women with a body mass index (BMI) >40 have a 60% higher risk of dying from all cancers than women of normal weight. They are also at increased risk from gynaecological cancer. Dietary factors significantly influence the risk of gynaecological cancer: fruit, vegetables and antioxidants reduce risk whereas high animal fat and energy intakes increase risk. Alcohol intake adversely affects breast cancer risk, possibly accounting for 4% of all breast cancers. Physical activity protects against ovarian, endometrial and postmenopausal breast cancer, independently of BMI. The oral contraceptive pill has a substantial and long-lasting effect on the prevention of ovarian and endometrial cancer and is one of the best examples of large-scale chemoprevention in the developed world. Childbearing is protective against ovarian, endometrial and breast cancer but increases the risk of cervical cancer. Smoking acts as a cofactor in cervical carcinogenesis and increases the risk of ovarian cancer, particularly mucinous tumours. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The iodine deficiency disorders program was begun a few years ago in Iran, and the coverage of iodized salt is sufficient now. But, in a periodic yearly medical examination of primary school girls in Qom, the prevalence of goiter was above 30% in 2002. This survey was designed to study the risk factors of goiter in those students. Design: The study was a randomized (multistage, proportional simple random sampling) case-control study. Subjects and interventions: We selected and performed thyroid examinations in 1050 girl students in primary schools in Qom city of Iran in 2002. We found 284 cases: girls in primary schools had goiter in accordance with the clinical exam of World Health Organization classification. Among students who did not present with goiter in the clinical exam, we randomly selected 288 students as the control group. We used a questionnaire to evaluate them for the risk factors of goiter. Results: The mean+s.d. ages of cases and controls were 8.7+1.3 and 8.9+1.3 years, respectively. There is no significant difference between the two groups regarding history of soya, kale, turnip, fish, daily iodized salt usage, education and job of mothers, monthly family income, nationality, immigration and residential situation. By using multinomial logistic regression, we found that storage of iodized salt in open containers, odds ratio (OR): 2.201 (1.412-3.428); P-value <0.0001, medium socioeconomic situation (SES) of family, OR: 2.099 (1.029-4.282), P-value=0.041, district 2 of Qom city, OR: 2.880 (1.376-6.027), P-value=0.005, and district 3 of Qom city, OR: 2.051(1.032-4.078), P-value=0.041, were the major risk factors for goiter in this population. Conclusions: In this study, the main risk factors for goiter were storage of iodized salt in open containers, medium SES and also living in specific districts of Qom city. As the coverage of iodinized salt is over 95% in Iran, we advise the education of the family about storage of iodized salt in closed containers. We also recommend the study of the other risk factors of goiter in the different geographical areas of Iran, because of differences in the SES and nutritional habits. 2006 Nature Publishing Group.

"1815","1794"," A. Ashkenazi, S. D. Silberstein","Hormone-related headache: Pathophysiology and treatment","Epidemiological data suggest a link between migraine and the female sex hormones. Indeed, it is known that estrogen affects various brain functions, including pain perception. The prevalence of migraine is similar in boys and girls before puberty, but is 3-fold higher in postpubertal females compared with males. Migraine attacks in women are more likely to occur in the perimenstrual period and occur exclusively so in some women. The acute treatment of menstrual migraine is similar to that of non-menstrually related attacks, but the response to treatment may be less favourable. Perimenstrual prophylaxis, with NSAIDs, triptans or estradiol, is effective in decreasing attack frequency and severity. The use of oral contraceptives (OCs) may change migraine frequency and severity. Since both migraine and hormonal contraceptive use are risk factors for ischaemic stroke, the use of OCs in women who experience migraine should be made only after consideration of the benefit-risk ratio. Migraine typically, but not invariably, improves during the last two trimesters of pregnancy, and may worsen in the postpartum period. When using drugs to treat migraine during pregnancy, potential risks to the mother and fetus should be considered. The prevalence of migraine decreases with advancing age and it improves in many, but not all, women after the menopause. However, in the perimenopausal period, migraine may worsen as a result of fluctuations in estrogen levels. Reducing the estrogen dose and changing the estrogen type or the route of administration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) from oral to transdermal may reduce headache. Migraine is not a risk factor for stroke in postmenopausal women. When considering symptomatic HRT for postmenopausal migraneurs, the usual indications and contraindications should be applied. HRT may also exacerbate migraine. 2006 Adis Data Information BV.

Bomser","Genistein modulates prostate epithelial cell proliferation via estrogen- and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent pathways","Epidemiological evidence suggests that consumption of soy is associated with a decreased risk for prostate cancer. Genistein, the most abundant isoflavone present in soy, is thought to be responsible, in part, for these anticancer effects. The present study examined the effects of genistein on cellular proliferation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activity and apoptosis in a nontumorigenic human prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1). Low concentrations of genistein (0-12.5 mumol/L) significantly increased cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activity (P<.01) in RWPE-1 cells, while higher concentrations (50 and 100 mumol/L) of genistein significantly inhibited cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activity (P<.001). A similar biphasic effect of genistein on MEK1 activity, an ERK1/2 kinase, was also observed. Pretreatment of cells with a MEK1 inhibitor (PD 098059) significantly blocked genistein-induced proliferation and ERK1/2 activity (P<.01). In addition, treatment of cells with ICI 182,780, a pure antiestrogen, inhibited genistein-induced RWPE-1 proliferation and ERK1/2 signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that genistein modulates RWPE-1 cell proliferation and signal transduction via an estrogen-dependent pathway involving ERK1/2 activation. 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Two hundred women (aged 29-65 years) who had received treatment for breast cancer within the last 5 years were included in this cross-sectional survey. Information was collected about their breast cancer treatment, menopausal symptoms (Menopausal Rating Scale), the perceived effects of menopausal symptoms on their and their partner's quality of life and any treatments they were receiving for hot flushes. Results: All but one woman reported at least one symptom related to the menopause (95.9% vasomotor; 83.3% psychological; 89.7% somatic). Current treatment with tamoxifen or previous chemotherapy did not influence the prevalence or the severity of hot flushes. Current antidepressant treatment was, however, significantly associated with a higher prevalence and severity of most menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes and sweats (p = 0.008). The severity of hot flushes and sweats was significantly correlated with self-assessed effects on overall quality of life (rs = 0.47); 56.4% of the respondents believed that menopausal symptoms had affected their partner's quality of life, the strongest correlations being with severity of sexual symptoms (rs = 0.56) and vaginal dryness (rs = 0.5). Only 21% of women experiencing hot flushes were receiving any treatment for hot flushes, with most women describing no knowledge or poor knowledge of treatment options. Conclusions: The majority of women receiving treatment for breast cancer report menopausal symptoms, which negatively correlate, not only with their own, but also with their partner's quality of life. Most women experiencing hot flushes are not receiving treatment due to lack of both awareness and confidence in the existing treatment options. 2006 International Menopause Society.",NA,"adult article awareness *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] chemotherapy correlation analysis diet therapy disease severity estrogen deficiency female health survey hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] human information major clinical study *menopausal syndrome/dm [Disease Management] prevalence priority journal psychological aspect quality of life soybean sweat vaginal dryness vasomotor reflex alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] amitriptyline/dt [Drug Therapy] antidepressant agent Cimicifuga racemosa extract/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/dt [Drug Therapy] herbaceous agent/dt [Drug Therapy] megestrol acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] primrose oil/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tibolone/dt [Drug Therapy] venlafaxine/dt [Drug Therapy]","49-58","9","2006",-1

Objectives: To examine the severity of climacteric complaints in breast cancer patients and to examine if they are willing to take HRT. Methods: In November 2003, a questionnaire was sent to 469 breast cancer survivors. The survey examined on a scale base the severity of climacteric complaints and the patient's opinion on starting HRT. Results: More than 76% of the patients complained that they experience or had experienced hot flushes or night sweating. More than half (53%) of this group found the inconvenience severe to extreme, affecting the patient's quality of life. A majority (80.5%) patients who had already taken HRT, found that it improved their quality of life substantially. When the results of observational studies were explained regarding HRT in breast cancer survivors, a majority said they would take or would consider taking HRT (57.9%). Conclusion: While physicians are more reserved in prescribing HRT in breast cancer survivors, a combination of severe symptomatic climacteric complaints and the willingness of the patient to be treated should at least result in a ""consideration"" of prescribing HRT. 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: In December 2002, a questionnaire was conducted in Flanders (Belgium). The survey contained a presentation of a 35-year-old breast cancer survivor who presented with climacteric symptoms after treatment with tamoxifen. Results: With a response rate of 33.65%, a majority of the physicians did not prescribe classical oral HRT (5.40%) in this patient. Physicians prefer to prescribe tibolone (30.68%) or other alternative treatment (50.00%). The main reason was the fear for increased recurrence of breast cancer. Furthermore the WHI oestrogen plus progestin trial and its attention in the media, a half year prior to the survey, influenced one-third of the physician's prescribing attitude. Conclusions: Two-thirds of the physicians did not change prescribing attitude after the WHI oestrogen plus progestin trial. HRT is a well proven effective treatment in breast cancer survivors with severe climacteric complaints, but a majority of physicians is not convinced of its safety in breast cancer survivors.

Expression of androgen- and estrogen-regulated genes was measured in LNCaP cells cultured in the presence or absence of hormonal stimulation and the presence or absence of genistein. Genistein strongly suppressed basal expression of androgen-responsive gene (ARG) mRNAs, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK). However, genistein had little or no effect on basal expression of two other ARGs, beta2-microglobulin (B2M) or selenoprotein P(SEPP1). Culturing LNCaP cells in the presence of the synthetic androgen R1881-induced increases in PSA, SPAK, B2M, and SEPP1 mRNA levels. The R1881-induced expression of these genes was uniformly blocked by genistein. For PSA and SPAK, genistein also blocked or downregulated 17beta-estradiol-induced increases in mRNA expression.

Phytoestrogens have been suggested to reduce the risk of prostate cancer (CaP), but no data exists on how oral phytoestrogen supplementation influences phytoestrogen concentrations in prostate tissue. METHODS. Forty men with CaP, assigned for radical prostatectomy, received 240 mg of clover phytoestrogens or placebo daily for a 2-week period before their operation in a prospective and randomized study. Phytoestrogens were measured in plasma and prostate tissue by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA). RESULTS. All patients had low baseline phytoestrogen concentrations and only 35% had a detectable plasma concentration of equol. Oral supplementation with phytoestrogens induced a statistically significant (P < 0.001) 23- and 7-fold increase in prostate tissue concentrations of the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein, respectively. Supplemented patients demonstrated prostate tissue genistein and daidzein concentrations that were over twofold higher than their plasma. Interestingly, even though the placebo group did not receive phytoestrogen challenge, they also demonstrated twofold prostate tissue genistein and daidzein concentrations compared to their plasma values, suggesting that the prostate can concentrate available phytoestrogens. In addition, after the supplementation, 90% of the supplemented patients had a detectable plasma equol concentration. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that prostate tissue can concentrate genistein and daidzein. Significant elevation of intraprostatic genistein and daidzein concentrations can be achieved with a short-term dietary phytoestrogen supplementation. 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"adult aged article cancer prevention chemoprophylaxis clinical article clinical trial clover controlled clinical trial controlled study *diet supplementation drug blood level drug tissue level fluoroimmunoassay human human tissue male priority journal prospective study *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/et [Etiology] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] *prostate cancer/su [Surgery] prostatectomy randomized controlled trial daidzein/cr [Drug Concentration] equol/cr [Drug Concentration] genistein/cr [Drug Concentration] isoflavone/cr [Drug Concentration] o norangolensin/cr [Drug Concentration] *phytoestrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *phytoestrogen/ad [Drug Administration] *phytoestrogen/cr [Drug Concentration] *phytoestrogen/do [Drug Dose] *phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *phytoestrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] placebo prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *trinovin/ct [Clinical Trial] *trinovin/ad [Drug Administration] *trinovin/cr [Drug Concentration] *trinovin/do [Drug Dose] *trinovin/dt [Drug Therapy] *trinovin/po [Oral Drug Administration] unclassified drug","82-87","66","2006",-1

Women with ovarian cancer who experience disease progression during or within 6 months of first-line treatment with platinum-based anticancer drugs are considered to have platinum-resistant tumors. These patients have an unfavorable prognosis, and they frequently seek complementary and alternative therapies (CAM). Historically, this represents an understudied and underreported component of ovarian cancer treatment. Case. This report describes the case of a woman with rapidly progressive, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Upon initiating self-directed treatment with Haelan951, a commercially available fermented soy beverage, she entered into a phase of prolonged disease stabilization including improvement in the serum tumor marker CA-125. Conclusion. Fermented soy products are known to contain high concentrations of the isoflavone, genistein, and other compounds that exhibit anticancer activity in preclinical models.

Colorectal epithelial cell proliferation has been used extensively as an intermediate endpoint biomarker for colorectal neoplasia. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that supplementation with soy protein containing isoflavones decreases colorectal epithelial cell proliferation. Design: A 12-mo randomized intervention was conducted in men and women aged 50-80 y with recently diagnosed adenomatous polyps. One hundred fifty participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to an active treatment group (58 g protein powder/d containing 83 mg isoflavones/d; +ISO) or a control group (ethanol-extracted soy-protein powder containing 3 mg isoflavones; -ISO). Biopsy specimens from the cecum, sigmoid colon, and rectum were collected at baseline and at the 12-mo follow-up. Ki-67 antibody immunohistostaining was used to detect cell proliferation. One hundred twenty-five participants completed the study, and proliferation was measured in the first 91 who completed the study. Results: In the sigmoid colon, cell proliferation increased by 0.9 (95% CI: 0.09, 1.9) labeled nuclei per crypt more (11%) in the +ISO group than in the -ISO group over the 12-mo intervention, which was opposite the direction predicted. The number of labeled nuclei per 100 mum crypt height also increased more in the +ISO than in the -ISO group. In the cecum and sigmoid colon, but not in the rectum, the proliferation count increased as the serum genistein concentration increased. Proliferation distribution and crypt height were not changed by treatment at any site. Conclusions: Supplementation with soy protein containing isoflavones does not reduce colorectal epithelial cell proliferation or the average height of proliferating cells in the cecum, sigmoid colon, and rectum and increases cell proliferation measures in the sigmoid colon. 2005 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.",NA,"*adenomatous polyp adult aged article cell proliferation colon biopsy controlled study epithelium cell female follow up geometry human human tissue immunohistochemistry intestine biopsy major clinical study male rectum biopsy isoflavone derivative Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soybean protein","620-626","82","2005",-1
"1839","1815"," B. Boyd, J. Bozzo, J. Castaner","Lapatanib: Oncolytic dual EGFR and erbB-2 inhibitor","Human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and erbB-2 are subclass I receptor tyrosine kinases that have been linked with a number of cancers, thereby making inhibitors of these proteins attractive targets for drug development. Several signaling cascades are associated with EGFR, which plays a role in mitogenesis, apoptosis, cell migration, differentiation and angiogenesis, all important processes in tumorigenesis. EGFR and its ligands are overexpressed in a number of solid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, ovarian, renal, gastric, hepatic and breast cancer. ErbB-2 overexpression has been found in a wide variety of cancers, including breast, bladder, colorectal, gastric, ovarian, prostate, renal and uterine cancers. Agents that target EGFR and erbB-2 are therefore under development or currently available for a number of cancer indications. One such agent is lapatinib, a potent and reversible dual EGFR and erbB-2 inhibitor that has shown promising pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics. Lapatinib has been investigated as an anticancer monotherapy, as well as in combination with trastuzumab, capecitabine, letrozole, paclitaxel and FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin), in a number of clinical trials.

"1841","1816"," J. J. Amy","Hormones and menopause: PRO","Since the publication of the first controlled randomised trials with disease event outcomes, it has become fashionable to denigrate hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The lack of protection against cardiovascular disease and the moderate increase of the risk of developing breast cancer and other ailments were given wide publicity by the lay press, which caused a considerable anxiety among users. The fact that a similar or even greater increase in the risk of developing a breast carcinoma is associated with a menarche before the age of 11 years, nulliparity, a first pregnancy after the age of 35 years, obesity, and moderate alcohol consumption was not mentioned. As a consequence, the adverse effects were put out of perspective and public opinion -including the medical profession- was blatantly misled. The reporting by medical journals was frequently equally biased. In the light of available evidence one can objectively state that HRT tailored to the needs of the individual woman and started around or shortly after the menopause improves her quality of life at the cost of a negligible risk. Oestrogens are ideally administered parenterally. In women who did not undergo a previous hysterectomy, the progestin should be delivered in the uterine cavity rather than systematically, which might lead to a lesser risk of breast malignancy. Indeed, this latter is not or significantly increased when unopposed oestrogens are administered. Likewise, the risks of cardiovascular disease and stroke are not increased in treated women, aged 50-59 years. In older women, HRT initiated in the perimenopause can be continued using lower doses.",NA,"alcohol consumption Alzheimer disease/si [Side Effect] anxiety breast cancer/si [Side Effect] cancer risk cardiovascular disease/si [Side Effect] cardiovascular risk clinical trial conference paper dementia/si [Side Effect] drug safety drug use estrogen therapy evidence based medicine female fragility fracture/dt [Drug Therapy] fragility fracture/pc [Prevention] hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] human low drug dose mass medium menarche *menopausal syndrome/dm [Disease Management] *menopausal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] menopause nullipara obesity primigravida publication quality of life risk factor treatment planning alendronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] calcitonin/dt [Drug Therapy] Cimicifuga racemosa extract/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/dt [Drug Therapy] *conjugated estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *conjugated estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *conjugated estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] *conjugated estrogen/do [Drug Dose] *conjugated estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] dydrogesterone/dt [Drug Therapy] *estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] *estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *estrogen/do [Drug Dose] *estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *estrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] *estrogen/pa [Parenteral Drug Administration] *estrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] *gestagen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *gestagen/ct [Clinical Trial] *gestagen/ad [Drug Administration] *gestagen/cb [Drug Combination] *gestagen/do [Drug Dose] *gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] *gestagen/ut [Intrauterine Drug Administration] isoflavone levonorgestrel/dt [Drug Therapy] *medroxyprogesterone acetate/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *medroxyprogesterone acetate/ct [Clinical Trial] *medroxyprogesterone acetate/cb [Drug Combination] *medroxyprogesterone acetate/do [Drug Dose] *medroxyprogesterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] norethisterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] paroxetine/do [Drug Dose] paroxetine/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen plant extract/dt [Drug Therapy] progesterone/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] red clover extract risedronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] serotonin uptake inhibitor/do [Drug Dose] serotonin uptake inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] *tibolone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *tibolone/dt [Drug Therapy] unclassified drug wild yam extract/dt [Drug Therapy]","261-268","60","2005",-1

Yang","Effects of herbal preparations containing isoflavones on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women","The effects of the mixed herbal preparation ""Tzuo-Kuai-Wuan"" (TKW) on bone metabolism were compared with a single herb containing equivalent amounts of isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and a combined estrogen-progesterone therapy (EPT). One hundred women completed the trial, 33 in group A, consuming a single herb, 30 in group B, consuming TKW, and 37 in group C, receiving EPT. In both herbal groups, the serum levels of daidzein significantly increased after treatment for 6 months (224% in group A and 234% in group B, both p < 0.01), though the serum levels of genistein did not change significantly. In group C, serum levels of either isoflavone changed only slightly. After 6 months of treatment, the bone formation marker (bone specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP]) significantly increased in group B, but not in group A (25.4% vs. 15.9%, p < 0.01 and p = 0.09, respectively). The elevation of BSAP was related to increased serum daidzein and genistein (beta = 0.498 and 0.248, p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively). The bone resorption marker (urinary deoxypyridinolines/creatinine [Dpd/Cr]) was nearly the same at beginning of the study and after treatment in both herbal groups. In contrast, BSAP and Dpd/Cr significantly decreased after 3 and 6 months of treatment in group C (BSAP: 10.4% and 30.3%; Dpd/Cr: 21.7% and 43.8%, all p < 0.01 in paired t-tests). Thus, we conclude that TKW stimulates bone formation, in contrast to EPT which primarily inhibits resorption. This effect appears to be related to the amount of isoflavones. Further, the stronger effect in women consuming TKW than consuming a single herb that contains equivalent amounts of isoflavones suggests higher synergistic or additive effect of other components than isoflavones in TKW.",NA,"abdominal disease/si [Side Effect] adult Angelica sinensis article *bone metabolism cervus nippon Chinemys reevesii clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study

After polycystic ovary syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, and other ovarian disorders that require medical treatment had been ruled out through smear test examinations of the uterine cervix and uterine myoma, ovarian tumor, and endometriosis had been checked for with ultrasonography and serum CA-125, the subjects began to take 6 g/day of black soybean in micropowder form for 6 months (S group). We estimated the ovular improvement of theses patients, observing basal body temperature (BBT) and follicular development with ultrasonography during the menstrual cycle as the indexes for ovulation and compared them with 34 patients with no treatment (C group). In the S group, improved ovulation was seen in 12 patients, four patients became pregnant, and three patients had anovular menstruation within 3 months after starting to take soybean powder. The periods of first ovulation were 66 + 12 days. After ovulation started, all subjects had regular menstruations and ovulation, with more than a 7-day high phase in BBT. On the other hand, in the C group, improved ovulation was seen in two patients, and two patients had anovular menstruation. In conclusion, black soybean has the potential to improve the anovular menstrual cycle.

"1849","1825"," G. Gasparini, R. Longo, F. Torino, A. Morabito","Therapy of breast cancer with molecular targeting agents","Invasive breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease sustained by intercorrelated and complex growth pathways. Classically, human breast carcinoma has been classified for therapeutic purposes in two distinct categories: one hormone-correlated, the other hormone-uncorrelated. However, the recent advancements of the technology applied to molecular biology by genomic and proteomic analyses have suggested that many more factors are involved in breast cancer growth and progression and that some clusters of these distinguish subgroups of patients at different prognosis. The knowledge of the diversities between tumor and normal tissue of origin is the key to identify novel targets for new selective therapeutic strategies. In fact, the principal goal of molecular-targeted therapy is the suppression of the transformed phenotype minimally affecting normal cells. This review focuses on the molecular targeting compounds directed against the known molecular pathways involved in breast cancer such as: type I growth factors (HER-2/neu; epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]), angiogenesis, cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) and farnesylation. Presently, trastuzumab is the first agent approved for therapy of HER-2/neu overexpressing tumors. Several other compounds directed against different targets have entered clinical evaluation and the preliminary results are here presented and commented. The major challenges on the clinical development of targeted therapy include the proper selection of patients, the identification of the optimal dosage and schedule of administration, the combinations with conventional treatments and the more appropriate therapeutic strategy. 2005 European Society for Medical Oncology.",NA,"alopecia/si [Side Effect] anemia/si [Side Effect] angiogenesis article

"1851","1826"," T. Low Dog","Menopause: A review of botanical dietary supplements","Since the release of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) findings, an increasing number of dietary supplement products specifically targeting women in menopause have appeared in the American marketplace. This growth highlights the need for a critical evaluation of the tolerability and effectiveness of these products. The purpose of this article is to assess the evidence for safety and benefit of botanical monopreparations used for relief of menopause-related symptoms. The Cochrane Library and Medline databases were searched from January 1966 to October 2004, using a detailed list of terms related to botanicals and menopausal symptoms. Studies were considered eligible (1) if they were controlled trials of a botanical monopreparation administered orally for a minimum of 6 weeks to perimenopausal or postmenopausal women with hot flashes and (2) if they included a placebo or comparative treatment arm. Topical preparations, botanical combinations, and dietary interventions, such as soy food or protein, were not included. No language restrictions were imposed on the search. A total of 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies indicate that extract of black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L.) improves menopause-related symptoms; however, methodologic shortcomings in the trials were identified. To date, 4 case reports of possible hepatotoxicity have been published, although previous safety reviews suggest that black cohosh is well tolerated and that adverse events are rare when it is used appropriately. The results of 6 clinical studies on soy (Glycine max L.) isoflavone extracts are mixed. Moreover, the composition and dose of soy supplements varies widely across studies, making comparisons and definitive conclusions difficult. One study challenged the long-term safety of high-dose soy isoflavone extract (150 mg/day for 5 years) on the uterine endometrium. Clinical data from 5 controlled trials assessing the efficacy of semipurified isoflavone red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) leaf extracts to reduce hot flash frequency and severity or to relieve symptoms associated with the domains of the Greene Menopausal Symptom Scale are contradictory. The largest study showed no benefit for reducing symptoms associated with menopause for 2 different red clover isoflavone products compared with placebo. No significant adverse events have been reported in the literature. Single clinical trials do not support the use of dong quai (Angelica sinensis L.), ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Mey), or evening primrose seed oil (Oenothera biennis L.) for improving menopausal symptoms. We conclude that black cohosh extracts appear to ease menopausal symptoms; ongoing studies funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will provide more definitive safety and efficacy data. Soy isoflavone extracts appear to have minimal to no effect, although definitive conclusions are difficult given the wide variation in product composition and dose. Long-term safety of higher dosage (150 mg/day) soy isoflavone extracts is uncertain. Semipurified isoflavone red clover leaf extracts have minimal to no effect in reducing menopausal symptoms. Dong quai, ginseng extract, and evening primrose seed oil appear to be ineffective in ameliorating menopausal symptoms at the dosages and in the preparations used in these studies. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

"1853","1827"," K. Page, S. Brownie, H. Wohlmuth","Natural management options for menopause","In summary, naturopathic practitioners aim to provide menopausal and peri-menopausal women with safe, effective treatment options guided by the principles of ""First Do No Harm"" and ""Treat the Whole Person."" In order to achieve this goal, physicians need to inform women about the benefits and risks associated with treatment options, particularly hormone replacement therapy. Several studies have evaluated the role of HRT and confirmed the risks associated with long-term use. In contrast, little is known about the safety and efficacy of bio-identical hormones, despite their growing popularity. As an alternative to conventional menopausal treatment, the model of natural therapies is based on providing relief from the symptoms associated with menopause and minimizing the post-menopausal risk of health problems in the longer term. Far removed from modern-day pharmaceuticals, Native Americans have been using herbal medicine for centuries to treat female gynecological disorders. And since its origins 100 years ago, the philosophy of naturopathic medicine advocates a holistic approach to physical, mental, and emotional health, which continues to be pertinent for the challenges of the 21st-century lifestyle and the menopausal woman. The naturopathic ideals of good nutrition, regular exercise, healthy lifestyle, stress management, and the appropriate use of herbal medicine, together with a positive psychological perspective, are the essential foundations for a healthy and natural transition through menopause.",NA,"alternative medicine amenorrhea/dt [Drug Therapy] arthritis/dt [Drug Therapy] asthma/si [Side Effect] autonomic neuropathy/dt [Drug Therapy] blood clotting breast tenderness/si [Side Effect] calcium intake cancer risk carbohydrate diet carbohydrate intake climacterium clinical feature clinical trial depression/si [Side Effect] discoid lupus erythematosus/si [Side Effect] drug effect drug efficacy drug safety dysmenorrhea/dt [Drug Therapy] exercise gallbladder disease/si [Side Effect] hair loss/si [Side Effect] headache/dt [Drug Therapy] headache/si [Side Effect] heart palpitation/dt [Drug Therapy] herbal medicine hormone blood level hormone substitution hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] hot flush/si [Side Effect] human hypertension/si [Side Effect] jaundice/si [Side Effect] laboratory test lifestyle *menopausal syndrome/di [Diagnosis] *menopausal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] *menopausal syndrome/th [Therapy] *menopause menstruation disorder/dt [Drug Therapy] meta analysis migraine/si [Side Effect] mood change nausea/si [Side Effect] nutritional assessment osteolysis psychological well being rash/si [Side Effect] respiratory tract disease/dt [Drug Therapy] review side effect/si [Side Effect] sweating systematic review systemic lupus erythematosus/si [Side Effect] tinnitus/dt [Drug Therapy] urinary tract disease/si [Side Effect] uterus bleeding/si [Side Effect] vagina candidiasis/si [Side Effect] vomiting/si [Side Effect] weight gain androstenedione/ec [Endogenous Compound] Cimicifuga racemosa extract/ct [Clinical Trial] Cimicifuga racemosa extract/dt [Drug Therapy] Cimicifuga racemosa extract/pd [Pharmacology] conjugated estrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] diosgenin/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estriol/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrone/dt [Drug Therapy] follitropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] isoflavone luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] paroxetine/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen prasterone/dt [Drug Therapy] prebiotic agent probiotic agent progesterone/dt [Drug Therapy] progesterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] raloxifene/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] raloxifene/cm [Drug Comparison] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] red clover extract/ct [Clinical Trial] red clover extract/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] selective estrogen receptor modulator/cm [Drug Comparison] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] sitosterol/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/cm [Drug Comparison] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] testosterone/dt [Drug Therapy]","20-28","4","2005",-1

Kimiagar","Assessment of soy phytoestrogens' effects on bone turnover indicators in menopausal women with osteopenia in Iran: A before and after clinical trial","Background: Osteoporosis is the gradual declining in bone mass with age, leading to increased bone fragility and fractures. Fractures in hip and spine are known to be the most important complication of the disease which leads in the annual mortality rate of 20% and serious morbidity rate of 50%. Menopause is one of the most common risk factors of osteoporosis. After menopause, sex hormone deficiency is associated with increased remodeling rate and negative bone balance, leading to accelerated bone loss and micro-architectural defects, resulting into increased bone fragility. Compounds with estrogen-like biological activity similar to ""Isoflavones"" present in plants especially soy, may reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women as they are similar in structure to estrogens. This research, therefore, was carried out to study the effects of Iranian soy protein on biochemical indicators of bone metabolism in osteopenic menopausal women. Materials and methods: This clinical trial of before-after type was carried out on 15 women 45-64 years of age. Subjects were given 35 g soy protein per day for 12 weeks. Blood and urine sampling, anthropometric measurement and 48-h-dietary recalls were carried out at zero, 6 and 12 weeks. Food consumption data were analyzed using Food Proccessor Software. For the study of bone metabolism indicators and changes in anthropometric data as well as dietary intake, and repeated analyses were employed. Results: Comparison of weight, BMI, physical activity, energy intake and other intervening nutrients did not reveal any significant changes during different stages of the study. Soy protein consumption resulted in a significant reduction in the urinary deoxypyridinoline and increasing of total alkaline phosphatase (p < 0.05), although the alterations in osteocalcin, c-telopeptide, IGFBP3 and type I collagen telopeptide were not significant. Conclusion: In view of beneficial effect of soy protein on bone metabolism indicators, inclusion of this relatively inexpensive food in the daily diet of menopausal women, will probably delay bone resorption, thereby preventing osteoporosis. 2005 Roudsari et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"adult anthropometry article blood sampling body mass body weight *bone turnover caloric intake clinical article clinical trial computer program controlled clinical trial controlled study drug effect drug research drug screening female food intake food processing human Iran nutrient osteolysis *osteopenia/dt [Drug Therapy] osteoporosis physical activity *postmenopause protein intake recall urinalysis alkaline phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] biochemical marker/ec [Endogenous Compound] carboxy terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] collagen type 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] connective tissue growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] deoxypyridinoline/ec [Endogenous Compound] osteocalcin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *phytoestrogen/an [Drug Analysis] *phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] soybean protein/ct [Clinical Trial] soybean protein/an [Drug Analysis] soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] soybean protein/pd [Pharmacology]",NA,"4","2005",-1

Study level meta-analyses are useful for combining information across studies if the information from each patient is not available. If patient level data are available for multiple studies, combining all of the micro data gives a more accurate estimate of treatment effects. Studies of different treatments can be effectively combined to compare efficacy and side effects. These studies can also be used to refine data collection tools, refine statistical methods, or describe the range of symptoms.

This article provides an overview of the questionnaires that assess menopausal symptoms and research efforts to better standardize symptom assessment. The reported rate of symptoms varies by ethnicity, stage of menopause, hormonal therapy and the measurement method. The use of estrogen therapy has declined sharply after the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Hormone Trial was stopped early because the potential risks out-weighed potential benefits. There is a limited research base that addresses the efficacy of supplements in controlling menopausal symptoms. The generalizability of several studies is limited because the study participants experiences menopause as the results of treatment for breast cancer.

By molecular imaging, we show that ER activation is present in non-reproductive organs to an extent similar to that observed with the administration of 17beta-estradiol, and it is not influenced by orchiectomy or treatment with an aromatase inhibitor. This, together with the use of a completely synthetic diet, proves that the activation of ERs observed is due to estrogenic compounds present in commercial diets and that it is not a secondary event determined by food consumption and metabolism. The pervasiveness of estrogenic compounds in nature poses the question of how relevant and necessary is the daily ingestion of natural compounds active through the ERs for the maintenance of a correct metabolism in both male and female mammals.

Van Helvoort","Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in men with prostate cancer and rising PSA: Effectiveness of a dietary supplement","Objectives: Epidemiological studies have shown significant relationships between the use of dietary components and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Large studies of primary prevention, which confirm these findings, are desirable but costly and difficult to design. The present tertiary prevention study reports on the effect of a dietary supplement in comparison with placebo on the rate of increase of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Methods: 49 patients with a history of prostate cancer and rising PSA levels after radical prostatectomy (n = 34) or radiotherapy (n = 15) participated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of a dietary supplement. Ethical approval of the protocol was obtained. Treatment periods of 10 weeks were separated by a 4-week washout period. The supplement consisted of soy, isoflavones, lycopene, silymarin and antioxidants as main ingredients. Changes in the rate of increase of PSA (PSA slope and doubling time) were the primary parameters of efficacy. Analyses according to intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) were carried out. Results: Baseline parameters did not differ between randomised groups. Five participants were lost to follow-up, however 46 could be evaluated in an ITT analysis. PP analysis could be performed in 42 men with at least 5 PSA measurements. Per protocol analysis showed a significant decrease in PSA slope (p = 0.030) and 2log PSA slope (p = 0.041). This translates into a 2.6 fold increase in the PSA doubling time from 445 to 1150 days for the supplement and placebo periods. No treatment-based changes in safety parameters were observed during the study. Conclusions: The soy-based dietary supplement utilised in this study was shown to delay PSA progression after potentially curative treatment in a significant fashion. More extensive studies of the supplement may be indicated. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study the ethanol extract of Chinese licorice root, Glycyrrhiza uralensis (G. uralensis) was investigated for its estrogenic effect and the ability to inhibit cell proliferation in the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line. The extract of the root of G. uralensis was fractionated in EtOH:H2O (80:20) (80% ethanol). The extract exhibited estrogenic effects similar to 17beta- estradiol (E2) and induced apoptosis at the same dose level (100 mug/ml) in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, results were associated with up-regulation of tumor suppressor gene p53 and pro-apoptotic protein Bax. G. uralensis extract caused the up-regulation of p21waf1/cip1 and down-regulation of cdk 2 and cyclin E and most significantly, induced G1 cell cycle arrest. This is the first study to show that the ethanolic extract of the root of G. uralensis has an estrogen-like activity and anti-cancer effects against MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Whilst the use of phytoestrogens to protect against hormone-dependent cancers or as a 'natural' alternative to hormone replacement therapy remains controversial, the data in this paper support the suggestion that extracts of root of the Chinese licorice G. uralensis might be of importance in this debate. 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, it has a potential for more application in the future. Objective: To investigate the effect of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and alpha-zearalanol (ZAL) on coagulation and fibrinolysis in ovariectomized rats and to compare and analyze their effects. Design: An observational and controlled experiment. Setting: Department of Pathophysiology of the Capital University of Medical Sciences and the Department of Pathophsiology of the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. Materials: The experiment was completed at the Science Department of Experiment Animals from July to September 2003. Thirty-six healthy female Wistar rats aged 12-week old, weighing (250+10)g, clean grade were involved. The animals were divided into 4 groups, namely sham-operation control group, ovariectomy (OVX) group, OVX +E2 group, OVX+ZAL group with 9 rats in each group. Methods: For the rats in the sham-operation control group, operation was performed without removing the ovary. For the rats in the OVX group, ovariectomy was performed and the rat models were made at the sterile condition. 1 mg/kg 17beta-estradiol and 1mg/kg alpha-zearalanol were respectively injected intramuscularly into the rats in the OVX +E2 group and OVX+ZAL group 14 days after the operation, once every three days for 35 days altogether. After the administration of 17beta-estradiol or alpha-zearalanol for 5 weeks, rats were killed, and blood was collected through the common carotid artery and plasma was collected from it. The prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were determined with coagulation method. The level of fibrinogen (FG) was measured with an automatic biochemistry analyzer. Tissue factor(TF)level was determined with ELISA method, the activity of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA)and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1)were determined with chromogenic substrate assay. At the same time, the uteri were cut off and weighed by an electronic scale to work out the uteri weight/body weight (g/kg). Main outcome measures: 1 PT, APTT, FG,TF, t-PA, PAI-1; 2 uteri mass/body mass. Results: All the 36 rats entered the stage of the result analysis. 1 change of PT: it was shorter in the OVX group than that in the sham-operation control group (P < 0.01), but it was longer than that in the OVX group after supplementation of E2 and ZAL (P < 0.05-0.01). 2 Change of FG and TF: they were significantly higher than those in the sham-operation control group (P < 0.05-0.01). But, they were lower than those in the OVX group after supplementation of E2 and ZAL (P< 0.05-0.01). 3 Change of tPA: It was significantly lower in the OVX group than that in the sham-operation control group [(0.33+0.33) mukat/L, (4.00+1.50) mukat/L, (q=9.43, P < 0.01)]. However, it was significantly higher than that in the OVX group after supplementation of E2 and ZAL [(1.83 +0.67)mukat/L, (1.17+0.83) mukat/L, (q=13.50, P < 0.01; q=5.00, P < 0.05). 4 Change of PAI-1: It was significantly higher than that in the sham-operation control group [(2.33+0.67) mukat/L,(1.17+0.33) mukat/L,(q=10.5, P < 0.01)]. 5Uteri mass/body mass: It was significantly lower in the OVX+ZAL group than that in the OVX+ E2 group [0.66,1.96, (q=14.67, P < 0.01)]. Conclusion: Both 17beta-estradiol and alpha-zearalanol can resume the balance of coagulation-fibrinolysis of ovariectomized rats, suggesting that azearalanol has a similar protective effect similar to that of 17beta-estradiol on cardiovascular system. As alpha-zearalanol has less adverse effect on uteri enlarging than 17beta-estradiol, it has a better prospect for substitution of estrogens as a natural phytoestrogen.",NA,"animal experiment article *blood clotting common carotid artery comparative study controlled study drug activity drug effect ectogenesis enzyme linked immunosorbent assay female fibrinogen blood level *fibrinolysis nonhuman ovariectomy partial thromboplastin time prothrombin time rat rat strain uterus weight *alpha zearalenol/cm [Drug Comparison] *alpha zearalenol/im [Intramuscular Drug Administration] *alpha zearalenol/pd [Pharmacology] *estradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] *estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estradiol/im [Intramuscular Drug Administration] *estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] fibrinogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] *phytoestrogen/im [Intramuscular Drug Administration] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] plasminogen activator inhibitor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] prothrombin thromboplastin/ec [Endogenous Compound] tissue plasminogen activator/ec [Endogenous Compound]","195-197","9","2005",-1

Green","New questions regarding bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations: A clinician's response","A recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to declare various brands of levothyroxine bioequivalent has provoked objections from several physicians' organizations. These organizations assert that the method of testing bioequivalence is flawed, and that indiscriminate switching among preparations could lead to serious instances of undertreatment and overtreatment of hypothyroid patients. In this review we first list common indications for thyroid hormone administration, distinguishing its use as replacement therapy in hypothyroidism from its use to suppress thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in cases of thyroid cancer, nodules, and goiter. The dangers associated with changing to a preparation with different bioavailability are summarized, noting the particular danger of giving a more active preparation to a patient receiving TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine. However, these dangers are part of a larger problem: there are data showing that large numbers of patients are already receiving an improper dosage of levothyroxine, as judged from measurements of serum TSH. The recent history of FDA actions concerning levothyroxine bioequivalence and the arguments of those in disagreement are summarized. The immediate response to these problems should be better education of both patients and physicians. It is also recommended that there be further discussion of the problems in determining bioequivalence, and that consideration be given to more accurate and clinically relevant methods. Such methods should include assessment of the changes in TSH induced by each preparation in athyrotic patients. Copyright 2003.

Because the two estrogen receptors (ERs) have different physiological functions and have ligand binding pockets that differ enough to be selective in their ligand binding, opportunities now exist for development of novel ER subtype-specific selective-ER modulators. 2005 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.",NA,"bone tissue breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/et [Etiology] cancer/si [Side Effect] cancer risk cardiovascular function central nervous system chromosome 14q conference paper *endocrine disease/dt [Drug Therapy] *endocrine disease/et [Etiology] *estrogen activity female infertility/et [Etiology] hematopoiesis *hormone receptor interaction human human cell insulin resistance/et [Etiology] ligand binding male infertility/et [Etiology] mammary gland function menopausal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] menopausal syndrome/et [Etiology] neuroprotection obesity/et [Etiology] ovary cell ovary insufficiency/et [Etiology] ovary polycystic disease/et [Etiology] peripheral nervous system phenotype priority journal prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] receptor down regulation reproduction salivary gland function tissue differentiation treatment indication 1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridine/to [Drug Toxicity] androstanediol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *antiestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *antiestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] complement component C3/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytokeratin 5/ec [Endogenous Compound] diethylstilbestrol/pd [Pharmacology] *estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] *estrogen agonist/dt [Drug Therapy] *estrogen agonist/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] finasteride/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] finasteride/dt [Drug Therapy] finasteride/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] lactoferrin/ec [Endogenous Compound] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein pS2/ec [Endogenous Compound] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] *selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] transcription factor AP 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] transcription factor Sp1/ec [Endogenous Compound] unclassified drug vitellogenin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","866-871","73","2005",-1

Soy and soy products as source of isoflavones were found to be inversely associated with high mammographic density, a marker for breast cancer risk. Another class of phytoestrogens, the lignans, which are more frequent in Western diets, are rarely investigated. Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort in Heidelberg (EPIC-Heidelberg) we explored the feasibility of mammogram collection and measurement of mammographic density in order to investigate the association between dietary phytoestrogen intake and breast density patterns. Wolfe classification was used to summarize mammographic density. Dietary habits were assessed by means of a validated food frequency questionnaire. Out of the 505 randomly selected women, 317 (63%) returned the questionnaire and 310 (61.4%) women provided informed consent to collect mammograms. Dietary intake of seven women with dense patterns (DY) was compared with 47 women without dense patterns. A high dietary intake of fibre (p-value = 0.008) and secoisolariciresinol (p-value = 0.043) is inversely associated with non-dense breast patterns. This is also observed for a high dietary intake of soy-products (p-value = 0.004) and, in tendency, genistein (p-value = 0.069). After adjustment for energy intake and age the groups of dense and non-dense mammographic patterns were different regarding the intake of carbohydrate (p = 0.032), soy-products (p = 0.020), fibre (p = 0.046), and secoisolariciresinol (p = 0.027). Our results suggest an inverse association between dietary lignan intake and breast density, similar to the findings for isoflavones. To our knowledge this is the first report on this association, but due to the risk of chance finding, this has to be confirmed in a study with sufficient statistical power. I.

Here, we evaluated intermediate markers of cancer risk in uteri of cycling, young adult Sprague-Dawley rats lifetime exposed to one of three AIN-93G semipurified diets: casein (CAS), soy protein isolate (SPI+ with 276 mg GEN aglycone equivalents/kg) and CAS+GEN (GEN at 250 mg/kg). Postnatal day 50 (PND50) rats lifetime exposed to GEN or SPI+ had similar uterine luminal epithelium height, myometrial thickness, endometrial gland numbers, endometrial immunoreactive proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and serum estrogen and progesterone, as CAS-fed rats. GEN-fed rats showed modestly increased apoptosis in uterine glandular epithelium, compared to those of CAS- or SPI+-fed groups. Diet had no effect on the uterine expression of genes for the tumor suppressors PTEN, p53 and p21, and the apoptotic-associated proteins Bcl2, Bax and progesterone receptor. Uterine tissue and serum concentrations of total GEN were higher in rats fed GEN than in those fed SPI+. Human Ishikawa endocarcinoma cells treated with GEN-fed rat serum tended to exhibit increased apoptotic status than those treated with CAS-fed rat serum. Exogenously added GEN (0.2 and 2 muM) increased, while estradiol-17beta (0.1 muM) decreased Ishikawa cell apoptosis, relative to untreated cells. Results suggest that lifetime dietary exposure to soy foods does not alter uterine cell phenotype in young adult rats, while GEN, by enhancing uterine endometrial glandular apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, may confer protection against uterine carcinoma. Given its limited influence on uterine phenotype of young adult females, GEN, when taken as part of soy foods or as supplement, should be favorably considered for other potential health benefits. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

"1893","1876"," S. Vyas, Y. Asmerom, D. D. De Leon","Resveratrol regulates insulin-like growth factor-II in breast cancer cells","IGF-II is a potent mitogen and inhibitor of apoptosis in breast cancer. Regulation of IGF-II is complex and includes inhibition by tumor suppressors, stimulation by oncogenes, and imprinting and hormonal regulation by estrogens. Resveratrol (RSV) is a phytoestrogen that displays estrogen-like agonistic and antagonistic activity. Recent studies have shown that RSV inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells and may represent a potent agent in chemopreventive therapy. Because 17beta-estradiol regulates IGF-II, we hypothesized that RSV may have a similar effect on IGF-II. The present study was designed to examine whether: 1) RSV modulates IGF-II in breast cancer cells; 2) regulation of IGF-II by RSV is dependent on the ER status; and 3) IGF-II (not IGF-I) mediates RSV effects on breast cancer cells. Treatment of MCF-7 and T47D cells with RSV (10-6 M) caused stimulation of precursor IGF-II mRNA and protein; this effect was blocked by coincubation with 17beta-estradiol (10-9 M). Cell growth stimulated by RSV (10-6 M) was blocked by addition of a blocking IGF-I receptor antibody, or the antiestrogen tamoxifen (10 -7 M). In contrast, RSV treatment (10-4 M) inhibited IGF-II secretion and cell growth in MCF-7 and T47D cells. No increase in IGF-II levels is seen in estrogen receptor (-) MCF-10 cells, even though cell growth was inhibited by RSV 10-4 M and precursor IGF-II blocked the inhibitory effect of resveratrol. No change in IGF-I was observed with RSV treatment (10 -6 to 10-4 M). Our study demonstrates that RSV regulates IGF-II and that IGF-II mediates RSV effect on cell survival and growth in breast cancer cells.

Method: Using cDNA gene array technology, we profiled the mRNA expression of 1176 genes in a rat model of acute otitis media. We identified changes in gene expression two-fold or greater 12 and 48 h after bilateral ME inoculation with either tryptic soy broth (TSB) or Streptococcus pneumoniae in TSB. Results: Transcripts of cytokines and cell adhesion molecules were up-regulated by 12 h, but returned to placebo transcription levels by 48 h. Three of six stress-response genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase, GADD45 and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) were up-regulated by 12 h, with HSP27 transcription levels continuing to rise through 48 h. All assayed transcription factors were up-regulated by 12 h, but only c-fos and c-jun up-regulation persisted to the 48-h time point. Up-regulation of apoptosis-related genes, except for bcl-x, was not evident until 48 h. These gene expression patterns reflected an early proinflammatory response consisting of cytokines, cell adhesion and stress-response molecules at 12 h followed by an up-regulation of apoptosis-related genes at 48 h. Conclusion: Downstream targets of several transcription factors, up-regulated transiently at 12 h, control secondary effects of S. pneumoniae infection, including apoptosis of neutrophils and mucosal epithelial cells, bone proliferation and promotion of leukocyte differentiation. These observations lead to a greater understanding of the early events in the pathogenesis of an AOM episode and highlight therapeutic targets, which may play a roll in the sequelae of AOM. 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Individuals with respiratory failure are supported with mechanical ventilation, leading to altered lung growth and injury. Understanding signaling pathways initiated by mechanical strain in lung epithelial cells will help guide development of strategies aimed at optimizing strain-induced lung growth while mitigating ventilator-induced lung injury. To study strain-induced proliferative signaling, focusing on the role of reactive oxidant species (ROS) and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, human pulmonary epithelial H441 and MLE15 cells were exposed to equibiaxial cyclic mechanical strain. ROS were increased within 15 min of strain. N-acetylcysteine inactivated strain-induced ROS and inhibited p42/44 MAP kinase phosphorylation and strain-induced proliferation. PD98059 and UO126, p42/44 MAP kinase inhibitors, blocked strain-induced proliferation. To verify the specificity of p42/44 MAP kinase inhibition, cells were transfected with dominant-negative mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 plasmid DNA. Transfected cells did not proliferate in response to mechanical strain. To determine whether strain-induced tyrosine kinase activity is necessary for strain-induced ROS-p42/44 MAP kinase signaling, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was used. Genistein did not block strain-induced ROS production or p42/44 MAP kinase phosphorylation. Gadolinium, a mechanosensitive calcium channel blocker, blocked strain-induced ROS production and p42/44 MAP kinase phosphorylation but not strain-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. These data support ROS production and p42/44 MAP kinase phosphorylation being involved in a common strain-induced signaling pathway, necessary for strain-induced proliferation in pulmonary epithelial cells, with a parallel strain-induced tyrosine kinase pathway.

The appearance of symptoms early in the course explains why most women with endometrial cancer have early-stage disease at presentation. For all stages taken together, the overall 5-year survival is around 80%. There is a substantial prognostic difference between the histological types of endometrial cancers. The most common lesions (type 1) are typically hormone sensitive and low stage and have an excellent prognosis, whereas tumours of type 2 are high grade with a tendency to recur, even in early stage.

Sarkar","Inactivation of nuclear factor B by soy isoflavone genistein contributes to increased apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents in human cancer cells","Cancer chemotherapeutic strategies commonly require multiple agents. However, use of multiple agents contributes to added toxicity resulting in poor treatment outcome. Thus, combination chemotherapy must be optimized to increase tumor response and at the same time lower its toxicity. Chemotherapeutic agents are known to induce nuclear factor B (NF-B) activity in tumor cells, resulting in lower cell killing and drug resistance. In contrast, genistein has been shown to inhibit the activity of NF-B and the growth of various cancer cells without causing systemic toxicity. We therefore investigated whether the inactivation of NF-B by genistein before treatment of various cancer cells with chemotherapeutic agents could lead to better tumor cell killing as tested by in vitro studies using gene transfections and also by animal studies. PC-3 (prostate), MDA-MB-231 (breast), H460 (lung), and BxPC-3 (pancreas) cancer cells were pretreated with 15 to 30 mumol/L genistein for 24 hours and then exposed to low doses of chemotherapeutic agents for an additional 48 to 72 hours. We found that 15 to 30 mumol/L genistein combined with 100 to 500 nmol/L cisplatin, 0.5 to 2 nmol/L docetaxel, or 50 ng/mL doxorubicin resulted in significantly greater inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis compared with either agent alone. Moreover, we found that the NF-B activity was significantly increased within 2 hours of cisplatin and docetaxel treatment and that the NF-B inducing activity of these agents was completely abrogated in cells pretreated with genistein. These results were also supported, for the first time, by animal experiments, p65 cDNA transfection and p65 small interfering RNA studies, which clearly showed that a specific target (NF-B) was affected in vivo. Collectively, our results clearly suggest that genistein pretreatment inactivates NF-B and may contribute to increased growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by cisplatin, docetaxel, and doxorubicin in prostate, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer cells. Theses results warrant carefully designed clinical studies investigating the combination of soy isoflavones and commonly used chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of human cancers. 2005 American Association for Cancer Research.",NA,"animal experiment animal model apoptosis article breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *cancer cell cancer graft *cancer growth cancer inhibition cell killing concentration response controlled study drug potentiation drug resistance *gene inactivation genetic transcription growth inhibition human human cell lung cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] male mouse nonhuman pancreas cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] priority journal protein DNA binding soybean tumor growth *antineoplastic agent/cb [Drug Combination] *antineoplastic agent/do [Drug Dose] *antineoplastic agent/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] *antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] beta actin cisplatin/cb [Drug Combination] cisplatin/do [Drug Dose] cisplatin/it [Drug Interaction] cisplatin/dt [Drug Therapy] cisplatin/pd [Pharmacology] cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 docetaxel/cb [Drug Combination] docetaxel/do [Drug Dose] docetaxel/it [Drug Interaction] docetaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] docetaxel/iv [Intravenous Drug Administration] docetaxel/pd [Pharmacology] doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] doxorubicin/do [Drug Dose] doxorubicin/it [Drug Interaction] doxorubicin/dt [Drug Therapy] doxorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/cb [Drug Combination] *genistein/do [Drug Dose] *genistein/it [Drug Interaction] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/po [Oral Drug Administration] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein *isoflavone/cb [Drug Combination] *isoflavone/do [Drug Dose] *isoflavone/it [Drug Interaction] *isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone/po [Oral Drug Administration] *isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] protein bcl 2 protein bcl xl small interfering RNA survivin synaptotagmin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","6934-6942","65","2005",-1

Morris","Structure activity relationships and quantitative structure activity relationships for the flavonoid-mediated inhibition of breast cancer resistance protein","Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is a newly identified ABC transporter, which plays an important role in drug disposition and represents an additional mechanism for the development of MDR. Flavonoids, a major class of natural compounds widely present in foods and herbal products, have been shown to be BCRP inhibitors. The objective of the present study was to elucidate the SAR and derive a QSAR model for flavonoid-BCRP interaction. The EC50 values for increasing mitoxantrone accumulation in MCF-7 MX100 cells for 25 flavonoids, from five flavonoid subclasses, were determined in this study or obtained from our previous publication [Zhang S, Yang X, Morris ME. Combined effects of multiple flavonoids on breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2)-mediated transport. Pharm Res 2004;21(7):1263-73], and ranged from 0.07 + 0.02 muM to 183 + 21.7 muM. We found that the presence of a 2,3-double bond in ring C, ring B attached at position 2, hydroxylation at position 5, lack of hydroxylation at position 3 and hydrophobic substitution at positions 6, 7, 8 or 4', are important structural properties important for potent flavonoid-BCRP interaction. These structural requirements are similar but not identical to those for potent flavonoid-NBD2 (P-glycoprotein) interaction, indicating that inhibition of BCRP by flavonoids may involve, in part, the binding of flavonoids with the NBD of BCRP. In addition, a QSAR model consisting three structural descriptors was constructed, and both internally and externally validated, suggesting the model could be used to quantitatively predict BCRP inhibition activity of flavonoids. These findings should be useful for predicting BCRP inhibition activity of other untested flavonoids and for guiding the synthesis of potent BCRP inhibitors for potential clinical application. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Osteoclast activation and differentiation are regulated by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), a heterogeneous cell compartment that comprehends undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and their specialized progeny. In this regard, we found that human primary BMSCs express immunoreactive EGFR. Expression of EGFR mRNA and protein was also demonstrated in two human, continuous MSC-like cell lines, HDS-1 and HDS-2 cells. Treatment of HDS cells with EGF produced a significant increase in the levels of activated EGFR which was not observed in the presence of gefitinib. A significant reduction in the basal levels of activation of the EGFR and of Akt was observed in HDS cells following treatment with gefitinib. Treatment of HDS cells with gefitinib produced a significant reduction in the levels of secreted macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and cell-associated receptor activator of NF- ligand (RANKL) in both cell lines, as assessed by using specific ELISA and Western blotting techniques. Finally, the ability to sustain the differentiation of pre-osteoclasts of conditioned medium from gefitinib-treated HDS cells was reduced by approximately 45% as compared with untreated HDS cells. These data have demonstrated for the first time that the EGFR regulates the ability of BMSCs to induce osteoclast differentiation and strongly support clinical trials of gefitinib in breast cancer patients with bone disease. 2005 Society for Endocrinology.",NA,"article bone marrow cell *bone metastasis/co [Complication] *bone metastasis/et [Etiology] *bone metastasis/pc [Prevention] cell differentiation controlled study enzyme linked immunosorbent assay flow cytometry human human cell immunohistochemistry nucleotide sequence osteoclast pathogenesis phenotype protein phosphorylation reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction stroma cell Western blotting amsacrine colony stimulating factor 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] epidermal growth factor receptor *epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] etoposide *gefitinib/pd [Pharmacology] genistein gyrase inhibitor lavendustin A messenger RNA osteoclast differentiation factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] recombinant epidermal growth factor transforming growth factor alpha tyrphostin","471-482","12","2005",-1

Some soy constituents, however, also stimulate cell proliferation, which has raised concerns in promoting soy intake among breast cancer survivors. To investigate whether soy intake may be associated with breast cancer survival, we evaluated data from a cohort of 1459 breast cancer patients who participated in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study between 1996 and 1998. Usual soy food intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire at baseline. The median follow-up time for this cohort of women was 5.2 years. We found that soy intake prior to cancer diagnosis was unrelated to disease-free breast cancer survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-1.33 for the highest tertile compared to the lowest tertile). The association between soy protein intake and breast cancer survival did not differ according to ER/PR status, tumor stage, age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), or menopausal status. Additionally, the soy-survival association did not appear to vary according to XbaI or PvuII polymorphisms in ER-alpha, or C(14206)T, G(25652)A, or A(50766)G polymorphisms in ER-beta.

"1927","1907"," N. F. Soliman","Treatment of vasomotor symptoms: Is there an alternative to hormone replacement therapy?","Menopause is associated with vasomotor symptoms, which can affect the quality of life of some women. Although oestrogen replacement therapy is an effective treatment yet many women declines its use especially with the highly publicised findings of Women Health Initiative trials. Although oestrogen withdrawal is the main cause of hot flushes, neurotransmitter modulators are involved in its pathophysiology. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as venlafaxine, flouxetine and paroxetine have been shown to reduce hot flushes by nearly 60% and are generally well tolerated. Trials on gabapentin, another group of neurotransmitter modulators, yielded similar results. Clonidine is a central alpha-adrenergic agonist, which is only modestly effective in reducing hot flushes. Their side effects may preclude their use but may be a suitable option for hypertensive patients with hot flushes. Non-prescription medications are widely popular as natural alternatives to hormone replacement therapy despite the lack of enough data regarding their safety. The current available evidence suggests that phytoestrogens are ineffective in treating hot flushes. Trials of black cohosh lack methodological quality and yielded conflicting results. Other herbal medicines are only included in isolated trials. Systemic progestogens can be effective in treating hot flushes but their long-term effect in breast cancer survivors is uncertain. There is little evidence to support progesterone cream for treatment of vasomotor symptoms. Many women might benefit of life style modifications and regular physical exercise. 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Breast cancer overexpressing oncogene HER-2/neu often denotes a poor prognosis. Many studies have demonstrated the antitumor effect of genistein against breast cancer. Objective: To study the relationship between HER-2/neu expression and angiogenesis in breast cancer as well as the effect of genistein on the angiogenesis in HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer. Design: A randomized controlled observatory experiment with nude mice. Setting: Department of nutrition and food hygiene of a military medical university. Materials: Twenty specific pathogen-free(SPF) normal female BALB/c nude mice weighing (10 + 2) g, aged 3 to 4 weeks, were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the Third Military Medical University. Methods: This study was carried out in the Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Third Military Medical University from June 2001 to March 2002. HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell line MCF-7/HER-2 was generated by transfecting MCF-7 cells with human HER-2/neu cDNA. MCF-7/HER-2 and MCF-7 cells were inoculated in female BALB/c nude mice to establish tumor-bearing mouse models. Four weeks after the inoculation, the mice with MCF-7/HER-2 xenografts were randomly divided into control, genistein treatment, and anti-HER-2/neu antibody treatment groups to receive corresponding treatments every other day for two weeks, at the end of which the tumor volume, microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) expression in the xenografts were measured. Main outcome measures: MVD and VEGF expression in the xenograft tumor. Secondary outcome measures: Identification of HER-2/neu-transfected from MCF-7-transfected cells and the tumor volume. Results: The MVD was 16 + 6, 98 + 21, 56 + 18, and 52 + 19 in each visual field in the MCF-7 xenografts group, control group, genstein treatment group and anti-HER-2/neu antibody treatment group reepectively. MVD and VEGF expression in MCF-7/HER-2 xenografts were higher than that in MCF-7 xenografts, and was reduced after treatment with genistein or anti-HER-2/neu antibody. The changes of tumor volume in these xenografts were consistent with the changes of MVD and VEGF. Conclusion: HER-2/neu overexpression in breast cancer promotes angiogenesis, and genistein can inhibit angiogenesis and growth of HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer to improve the prognosis.",NA,"angiogenesis animal experiment animal model antineoplastic activity article *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] controlled study drug mechanism female gene overexpression human human cell mouse nonhuman nude mouse oncogene neu prognosis tumor vascularization tumor volume tumor xenograft complementary DNA *epidermal growth factor receptor 2 *genistein/dv [Drug Development] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology]","228-230","9","2005",-1

In the present study, we examined the in vitro effects of five PKIs, i.e. ST, 1-5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), bisindolylmaleimide-I (BIS), Genistein (GEN), and Herbimycin A (HERB) alone or in combination with 5-FU on CEA expression. C22-20, a clonal subline, derived from colon cancer HT-29 line, selected for low expression of CEA, was used in our experimental model. Among the PKIs tested, only ST, at non-toxic concentrations of 5 nM, was capable of increasing the level of CEA. The other PKIs did not modify CEA expression when used either alone or in combination with 5-FU. Flow cytometric analysis showed that treatment of cells with 5-FU + ST resulted in a synergistic increase of CEA expression, being higher than that obtainable with both agents alone. Moreover, the increase of CEA expression occurred not only in membrane fractions but also in cytosolic compartments, as indicated by Western blot analysis. The present study suggests that ST-mediated induction of CEA expression in cancer cells is PKC independent and could be of potential clinical interest for the development of new diagnostic and/or immunotherapeutic approaches. 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) demonstrated that finasteride can prevent prostate cancer, albeit with an apparently increased risk of high-grade disease. A substantial amount of epidemiologic, molecular, and clinical evidence suggests that both selenium and vitamin E might also prevent prostate cancer, and this combination is being tested in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).

Benedetto","Advanced strategies of short-term prophylaxis in menstrual migraine: State of the art and prospects","Patients suffering from menstrual migraine (MM) may be ideal candidates for an intermittent prophylaxis, usually termed short-term or mini-prophylaxis. It covers the whole period of vulnerability, e. g., the perimenstrual period, starting some days before the expected onset of MM attack. Theoretically MM attacks are an optimal target for drugs specifically developed for acute head pain. Unfortunately, due to their particular tendency to be longer, more intense and less responsive to analgesics, symptomatic approaches alone are not often able to completely control pain and its correlates. Many drugs have been proposed for short-term prophylaxis of MM. In this paper we analyse only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, coxibs and triptans (especially those with longer half-life, naratriptan and frovatriptan). Moreover, MM can be prevented by a variety of hormonal manipulations, including oral contraceptives, which may be administered with an extended-dosing strategy; oestrogen replacement therapy; antioestrogen agents (danazol, tamoxifen); gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists followed by oestrogen add-back therapy. Finally, the use of some products, such as magnesium and phytoestrogens, that probably meet the requirements of those patients that appreciate a more ""natural"" approach, is discussed.

Perez-Victoria","Flavonoid structure-activity studies identify 6-prenylchrysin and tectochrysin as potent and specific inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2","Overexpression of breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2 confers multidrug resistance in cancer cells. The GF120918-sensitive drug efflux activity of human wild-type (R482) ABCG2-transfected cells was used for rational screening of inhibitory flavonoids and establishment of structure-activity relationships. Flavones were found more efficient than flavonols, isoflavones, and flavanones. Differentially substituted flavone derivatives indicated positive OH effects at position 5, in contrast to positions 3 and 7. A methoxy at position 7 was slightly positive in tectochrysin, whereas a strong positive effect was produced by prenylation at position 6. The potency of 6-prenylchrysin was comparable with that of GF120918 (IC50 = 0.3 mumol/L). Both 6-prenylchrysin and tectochrysin seemed specific for ABCG2 because no interaction was detected with either P-glycoprotein or MRP1. The ABCG2 resistance profile in vitro is altered by mutation at amino acid 482. The R482T mutation limited the effect of prenylation on ABCG2 inhibition. Whereas GF120918 strongly inhibited the ATPase activity of wild-type ABCG2, neither 6-prenylchrysin nor tectochrysin altered the activity. In contrast, all three inhibitors stimulated the ATPase activity of mutant ABCG2. 6-Prenylchrysin at 0.5 mumol/L efficiently sensitized the growth of wild-type ABCG2-transfected cells to mitoxantrone, whereas higher concentrations were required for the mutant ones. In contrast, 1 mumol/L tectochrysin was sufficient to fully sensitize mutant ABCG2-transfected cells, whereas higher concentrations were required for the wild-type ones. Both flavones exhibited a lower intrinsic cytotoxicity than GF120918 and were apparently not transported by ABCG2. 6-Prenylchrysin and tectochrysin therefore constitute new and promising inhibitors for the reversal of ABCG2-mediated drug transport. 2005 American Association for Cancer Research.",NA,"article cancer cell cell growth controlled study cytotoxicity drug activity drug interaction drug potency drug sensitivity drug transport genetic transfection human human cell multidrug resistance prenylation priority journal structure activity relation *6 prenylchrysin/an [Drug Analysis] *6 prenylchrysin/cm [Drug Comparison] *6 prenylchrysin/pd [Pharmacology] *breast cancer resistance protein/an [Drug Analysis] *breast cancer resistance protein/cm [Drug Comparison] *breast cancer resistance protein/pd [Pharmacology] elacridar/cm [Drug Comparison] elacridar/pd [Pharmacology] flavanone/an [Drug Analysis] flavanone/cm [Drug Comparison] flavone/an [Drug Analysis] flavone/cm [Drug Comparison] *flavonoid/an [Drug Analysis] *flavonoid/cm [Drug Comparison] *flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] flavonol/an [Drug Analysis] flavonol/cm [Drug Comparison] glycoprotein P/it [Drug Interaction] isoflavone/an [Drug Analysis] isoflavone/cm [Drug Comparison] mitoxantrone/cr [Drug Concentration] multidrug resistance protein 1/it [Drug Interaction] *tectochrysin/an [Drug Analysis] *tectochrysin/cm [Drug Comparison] *tectochrysin/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","4852-4860","65","2005",-1

Chang","Effect of dietary intake of phytoestrogens on estrogen receptor status in premenopausal women with breast cancer","Although many dietary studies have focused on breast cancer risk, few have examined dietary influence on tumor characteristics such as estrogen receptor (ER) status. Because phytoestrogens may modulate hormone levels and ER expression, we analyzed ER status and phytoestrogen intake in a case-case study of 124 premenopausal breast cancer patients. We assessed intake with a food-frequency questionnaire and obtained ER status from medical records. Rather than focusing on risk, we evaluated whether low intakes were more strongly associated with ER-negative tumors than with ER-positive disease. In logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders, threefold greater risks of ER-negative tumors relative to ER-positive tumors were associated with low intake of the isoflavones genistein (odds ratio, OR = 3.50; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.43-8.58) and daidzein (OR = 3.70; 95% CI = 1.31-7.30). Low intake of the flavonoid kaempferol (OR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.16-0.83), the trace element boron (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.13-0.83), and the phytosterol beta-sitosterol (OR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.18-0.98) were associated with decreased risk of ER-negative tumors relative to ER-positive disease. Other phytoestrogens were not significantly associated with ER status. Thus, in premenopausal patients, some phytoestrogens may affect breast carcinogenesis by influencing ER status. Such findings suggest new directions for mechanistic research on dietary factors in breast carcinogenesis that may have relevance for prevention and clinical treatment.

In this article, we review lignan food sources and metabolism, proposed anti-carcinogenic mechanisms, and the evidence for a role of lignans in breast, colon, and prostate cancer prevention from animal and epidemiologic literature. Although a number of in vitro and animal studies support a role for lignan-rich foods and purified lignans in the modulation of cancer events of the breast, prostate, and colon, epidemiological studies, sparse and often retrospective in nature, offer inconsistent findings. The most support for a role of lignans in cancer is observed for premenopausal breast cancer. Additional epidemiological studies that use a prospective design and well-developed food databases and questionnaires are needed to adequately evaluate the role of lignans in cancer prevention.

Here, we evaluated the tumor protective effects of these same diets to the direct-acting carcinogen N-methyl-nitrosourea (NMU). Tumor incidence was reduced and tumor latency was enhanced, in NMU-administered female rats lifetime exposed to SPI+, relative to the CAS group. Tumor multiplicity did not differ with diet, while tumor grade tended to be more advanced with SPI+. Normal mammary glands of CAS and SPI+ tumor-bearing rats had comparable proliferative and apoptotic status. However, mammary expression of HER-2/neu and progesterone receptor (PR) genes was higher for SPI+ rats. Moreover, tumored SPI+ rats had lower serum progesterone levels than those fed CAS, while serum estrogen did not differ. Serum from tumored SPI+ rats had higher apoptotic activity towards mammary epithelial MCF-7 cells, than CAS serum. Thus, dietary soy protects against mammary tumorigenesis induced by a direct-acting carcinogen and alters signaling pathways involving PR and HER-2/neu. 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although the physiology of hot flushes is not fully defined, understanding the complex thermoregulatory circuitry that underlies VMS is important for the development of new therapies. This circuitry is composed of three distinct, yet interconnected, components: core body temperature, neurochemical messaging and peripheral vasculature. Evidence suggests that multiple physiological systems, including the neuroendocrine system, are important in the maintenance of thermoregulatory control. Causative roles of declining ovarian steroid levels in initiating thermoregulatory dysfunction are well documented. This paper reviews the physiology involved in the underlying thermoregulatory dysfunction that presumably causes VMS and discusses how this physiology relates to current and future VMS treatment options. 2005 Ashley Publications Ltd.",NA,"acupuncture body weight breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] circadian rhythm clinical trial core temperature disease association disease severity environmental temperature exercise female food intake hormonal therapy hot flush/dt [Drug Therapy] hot flush/si [Side Effect] hot flush/th [Therapy] human lifestyle magnet medical decision making menopause meta analysis monkey neurochemistry neuroendocrine system neuromodulation night sweat/dt [Drug Therapy] night sweat/th [Therapy] nonhuman pathophysiology peripheral circulation rat relaxation training review symptom systematic review thermoregulation *vasomotor disorder/dt [Drug Therapy] *vasomotor disorder/si [Side Effect] *vasomotor disorder/th [Therapy] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] Angelica sinensis extract/dt [Drug Therapy] anticonvulsive agent/ct [Clinical Trial] anticonvulsive agent/dt [Drug Therapy] antidepressant agent/ct [Clinical Trial] antidepressant agent/dt [Drug Therapy] antihypertensive agent/ct [Clinical Trial] antihypertensive agent/dt [Drug Therapy] antihypertensive agent/po [Oral Drug Administration] antihypertensive agent/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] Cimicifuga racemosa extract/dt [Drug Therapy] citalopram/ct [Clinical Trial] citalopram/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/ct [Clinical Trial] clonidine/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/po [Oral Drug Administration] clonidine/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] estrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] fluoxetine/ct [Clinical Trial] fluoxetine/dt [Drug Therapy] gabapentin/ct [Clinical Trial] gabapentin/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/cb [Drug Combination] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/po [Oral Drug Administration] gestagen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] ginseng extract/dt [Drug Therapy] Glycyrrhiza extract/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] mirtazapine/ct [Clinical Trial] mirtazapine/dt [Drug Therapy] noradrenalin/ec [Endogenous Compound] paroxetine/ct [Clinical Trial] paroxetine/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo primrose oil/dt [Drug Therapy] sedative agent/dt [Drug Therapy] serotonin/ec [Endogenous Compound] sertraline/ct [Clinical Trial] sertraline/dt [Drug Therapy] steroid/ec [Endogenous Compound] tamoxifen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] venlafaxine/ct [Clinical Trial] venlafaxine/dt [Drug Therapy]","435-448","14","2005",-1

This paper examines the theories and the literature that relate to diagnosis, prevention and treatment of bone loss at the time of menopause according to the principles of TCM. It also considers practical developments in these areas as illustrated by the authors' research findings in recent studies. TCM diagnosis attributes a number of different underlying patterns to menopausal bone loss. A very common pattern in this situation is a Kidney qi and yin deficiency pattern. TCM analysis can be used as an early determinant of those persons who are potentially at risk of bone loss. Acupuncture, herbal medicine and Tai Ji exercise can then be applied to prevent and treat osteoporosis. These treatments can be effective, if they are applied correctly.

As there are big cultural variations in the menopause experience, there has been much interest in diet and life style factors that may contribute to this difference. A growing number of women use complementary and alternative therapies either in response to the media hype or disappointment in orthodox medicine, thinking that they provide a safe, natural option. However, they do have the potential for harm, in addition to failing to offer any benefit. Unlike HRT that treats every menopause symptom, often women will have to pursue a number of different alternatives to improve a number of symptoms, needing commitment and patience. Women on low incomes are disadvantaged as rarely alternative treatments are available on the NHS. It is important as health practitioners to ask patients if they are using alternative treatments, particularly herbal remedies that may interact with other medication or have side effects. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Animals in the baseline group were killed at the beginning of the experiment and were subjected to bone density assessment by peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT). The control group was fed a base diet free of phytoestrogens, while animals in the contraceptive group received the same base diet mixed with 2.67 mug desogestrel/100 g body weight and 0.0533 mug ethinyl estradiol/100 g body weight. The duration of the treatment period was 16 weeks. Densitometric measurements by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and serum bone markers assessment were carried out at baseline, at 8 weeks and at 16 weeks, while pQCT densitometry took place after sacrifice. All bone mineral density and bone mineral content indices measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry increased significantly throughout the study period in both the OC and control group. Concerning pQCT measurements, animals in both the OC and the control group had significantly higher cortical density compared with baseline (midtibia: p=.0003 and. 0003, respectively). Total area and periosteal circumference were significantly higher in OC group, both in proximal (p=.003 and. 003, respectively) and midtibia (p=.048 and. 042, respectively) compared with baseline. Osteoprotegerin serum levels increased in both groups, and at the end of the experiment, circulating osteoprotegerin was significantly higher in the OC group compared with controls (p=.032). At the end of the experiment, carboxyl-terminal telopeptides of collagen type I levels were significantly lower in the OC-treated animals compared with controls (p=.046). Our results suggest that OC administration to skeletally immature female rats allows normal bone accrual and may even improve bone geometry. This effect may be mediated through enhanced inhibition of bone resorption. 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Food or food supplements containing phytoestrogen are often been advocated as an alternative to hormonal replacement therapy (HRT)in women with contra-indications to the use of conventional oestrogen replacement, or simply wanting a more ""natural"" alternatives. There have been several studies performed with phytoestrogen in various aspects of the postmenopausal women health. Results have been sometime conflicting and difficult to interpret. The lack of knowledge of what precisely is the active ingredient, its minimally effective doses, the lack of standardization of the preparations used as well as the large individual variability of metabolism of precursors introduced with the diet may all have played a role in confusing the issue about effectiveness of these compounds. Phytoestrogen fall in the gray area between food and drugs hence in spite of the vast public interest, there are no interests in company producing these supplements in investing in research from which they will not exclusively benefit from. It is often difficult for physician to know how to advise patients on this matter.

Actaea racemosa L.) on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells were reported recently. In this study, we turned examined another hormone-dependent, epidemiologically important tumor disease, prostate cancer. The cell growth inhibitory effect of an isopropanolic extract of black cohosh (iCR) on androgen-sensitive LNCaP and androgen-insensitive PC-3 and DU 145 prostate cancer cells was investigated. Materials and Methods: The cytotoxic effect of the extract was determined by WST-1 assay. Apoptosis was determined by the appearance of apoptotic morphology, annexin V-FITC adherence and caspase activation. Cytokeratin (CK) 18 degradation was identified with M30 monoclonal antibody. Results: Regardless of their hormone sensitivity, the growth of prostate cancer cells was significantly and dose-dependently down-regulated by iCR. The drug concentration producing 50% cell growth inhibition in all cell lines after 72h lay between 37.1 and 62.7 mug/ml. Increases in the level of M30 antigen of approximately 1.8-, 5.9- and 5.3-fold over untreated controls were observed in black cohosh-treated PC-3, DU 145 and LNCaP cells, respectively, with the induction of apoptosis being dose- and time-dependent. Conclusion: Black cohosh extract kills human hormone-responsive or-unresponsive prostate cancer cells by induction of apoptosis and activation of caspases. This finding suggests that the cell's hormone responsive status is not an important determinant of the response to the extract and that iCR extract may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.",NA,"*apoptosis article breast cancer cell growth cell proliferation Cimicifuga racemosa controlled study cytotoxicity dose time effect relation enzyme activation growth inhibition hormone dependence hormone response hormone sensitivity human human cell inhibition kinetics *medicinal plant priority journal *prostate carcinoma/pc [Prevention] *protein degradation *2 propanol/dv [Drug Development] *2 propanol/pd [Pharmacology] *androgen/ec [Endogenous Compound] annexin/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *Cimicifuga racemosa extract/dv [Drug Development] *Cimicifuga racemosa extract/pd [Pharmacology] *cytokeratin 18/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] fluorescein isothiocyanate genistein/pd [Pharmacology] monoclonal antibody monoclonal antibody m30 staurosporine/pd [Pharmacology] tamoxifen citrate/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","139-147","25","2005",-1

Patisaul","Phytoestrogen action in the adult and developing brain","Soy isoflavonoids are plant phytoestrogens available as dietary supplements and are increasingly advocated as a natural alternative to oestrogen replacement therapy. As weak oestrogen agonists/antagonists with a range of other enzymatic activities, the isoflavonoids provide a useful model to investigate the actions of endocrine disruptors. Here, the activational and organisational effects of these compounds on the brain are reviewed. In spite of their preferential affinity for oestrogen receptor (ER)beta in vitro, isoflavonoids act in vivo through both ERalpha and ERbeta. Their neurobehavioural actions are largely anti-oestrogenic, either antagonising or producing an action in opposition to that of oestradiol. Small, physiologically relevant exposure levels can alter oestrogen-dependent gene expression in the brain and affect complex behaviour in a wide range of species. The implications for these findings in humans, and particularly in infants, largely remain uninvestigated but are a subject of increasing public interest. 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",NA,"antineoplastic activity article artificial milk binding affinity *brain development cognition corticosterone blood level dose response drug blood level drug metabolism drug receptor binding drug structure drug synthesis enzyme mechanism food analysis food intake gene expression genetic transcription goiter/si [Side Effect] *hormone action hormone substitution human hypothalamus hypothyroidism/si [Side Effect] in vitro study in vivo study nonhuman ovary function postmenopause priority journal sexual behavior soybean stress task performance tranquilizing activity vasopressin blood level 17alpha estradiol/an [Drug Analysis] 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol/an [Drug Analysis] apigenin/an [Drug Analysis] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] corticosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] coumestrol/an [Drug Analysis] coumestrol/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein/an [Drug Analysis] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] diethylstilbestrol/an [Drug Analysis] enterolactone/an [Drug Analysis] enterolactone/pd [Pharmacology] equol/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] flavone derivative/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxytamoxifen/an [Drug Analysis] isoflavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] isoliquiritigenin/an [Drug Analysis] kaempferol/an [Drug Analysis] methoxychlor/an [Drug Analysis] naringenin/an [Drug Analysis] oxytocin/ec [Endogenous Compound] oxytocin receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] phloretin/an [Drug Analysis] *phytoestrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *phytoestrogen/an [Drug Analysis] *phytoestrogen/cr [Drug Concentration] *phytoestrogen/do [Drug Dose] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] progesterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein tyrosine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] vasopressin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","57-64","17","2005",-1

Replacement therapy is effective for both prevention and therapy, but recent findings have shown that its long term admnistration is not as safe as was previously thought, so alternative treatments are urgently needed. Dietary phytoestrogens are emerging as a valid alternative to estrogens in the treatment of menopause-related diseases, such as the climacteric syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, dementia. This review summarizes the main epidemiological, in vitro, animal and clinical evidence related to the effects of phytoestrogens on bone metabolism and bone density. It also argues the possibility that dietary changes in Western habits favouring an increased intake of phytoestrogens-rich foods, could contribute to prevent and to reduce the incidence of postmenopausal osteoporosis in this population.

The mechanisms underlying the cancer-protective effects of these naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds, however, remain elusive. Based on our previous finding that the cytotoxic effect of the flavanol epigallocatechin-3-gallate on prostate cancer cells correlates with its ability to inhibit fatty acid synthase (FAS, a key lipogenic enzyme overexpressed in many human cancers), we examined the antilipogenic effects of a panel of 18 naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds. In addition to epigallocatechin-3-gallate, five other flavonoids, more particularly luteolin, quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin, and taxifolin, also markedly inhibited cancer cell lipogenesis. Interestingly, in both prostate and breast cancer cells, a remarkable dose-response parallelism was observed between flavonoid-induced inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, inhibition of cell growth, and induction of apoptosis. In support for a role of fatty acid synthesis in these effects, the addition of exogenous palmitate, the end product of FAS, markedly suppressed the cytotoxic effects of flavonoids. Taken together, these findings indicate that the potential of flavonoids to induce apoptosis in cancer cells is strongly associated with their FAS inhibitory properties, thereby providing a new mechanism by which polyphenolic compounds may exert their cancer-preventive and antineoplastic effects.",NA,"addition reaction antineoplastic activity *apoptosis article breast cancer *cancer cell cancer inhibition cancer prevention controlled study cytotoxicity drug effect enzyme activity enzyme inhibition examination fatty acid synthesis *gene induction gene repression human human cell lipogenesis observation priority journal prostate cancer 3 hydroxyflavone/an [Drug Analysis] 3 hydroxyflavone/cm [Drug Comparison] 3 hydroxyflavone/dv [Drug Development] 3 hydroxyflavone/pd [Pharmacology] apigenin/an [Drug Analysis] apigenin/cm [Drug Comparison] apigenin/dv [Drug Development] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] catechin/an [Drug Analysis] catechin/cm [Drug Comparison] catechin/dv [Drug Development] catechin/pd [Pharmacology] epicatechin/an [Drug Analysis] epicatechin/cm [Drug Comparison] epicatechin/dv [Drug Development] epicatechin/pd [Pharmacology] epicatechin 3 gallate/an [Drug Analysis] epicatechin 3 gallate/cm [Drug Comparison] epicatechin 3 gallate/dv [Drug Development] epicatechin 3 gallate/pd [Pharmacology] epicatechin gallate/an [Drug Analysis] epicatechin gallate/cm [Drug Comparison] epicatechin gallate/dv [Drug Development] epicatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin/an [Drug Analysis] epigallocatechin/cm [Drug Comparison] epigallocatechin/dv [Drug Development] epigallocatechin/pd [Pharmacology] epigallocatechin gallate/an [Drug Analysis] epigallocatechin gallate/cm [Drug Comparison] epigallocatechin gallate/dv [Drug Development] epigallocatechin gallate/pd [Pharmacology] eriodictyol/an [Drug Analysis] eriodictyol/cm [Drug Comparison] eriodictyol/dv [Drug Development] eriodictyol/pd [Pharmacology] *fatty acid synthase *flavonoid/an [Drug Analysis] *flavonoid/cm [Drug Comparison] *flavonoid/dv [Drug Development] *flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] galangin/an [Drug Analysis] galangin/cm [Drug Comparison] galangin/dv [Drug Development] galangin/pd [Pharmacology] gene product genistein/an [Drug Analysis] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/dv [Drug Development] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] kaempferol/an [Drug Analysis] kaempferol/cm [Drug Comparison] kaempferol/dv [Drug Development] kaempferol/pd [Pharmacology] luteolin/an [Drug Analysis] luteolin/cm [Drug Comparison] luteolin/dv [Drug Development] luteolin/pd [Pharmacology] myricetin/an [Drug Analysis] myricetin/cm [Drug Comparison] myricetin/dv [Drug Development] myricetin/pd [Pharmacology] naringenin/an [Drug Analysis] naringenin/cm [Drug Comparison] naringenin/dv [Drug Development] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] palmitic acid polyphenol derivative/an [Drug Analysis] polyphenol derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] polyphenol derivative/dv [Drug Development] polyphenol derivative/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/an [Drug Analysis] quercetin/cm [Drug Comparison] quercetin/dv [Drug Development] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] resveratrol/an [Drug Analysis] resveratrol/cm [Drug Comparison] resveratrol/dv [Drug Development] resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] taxifolin/an [Drug Analysis] taxifolin/cm [Drug Comparison] taxifolin/dv [Drug Development] taxifolin/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","5636-5645","280","2005",-1

This report describes results from a case-control study of diet and risk of breast cancer nested in a randomized trial of breast self exam in Shanghai, China. Participating breast cancer cases (n = 378) and frequency age-matched controls (n = 1,070) completed a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire and a risk factor questionnaire. After adjustment for age, total energy intake, and total years of breast-feeding, women in the highest quartile of fruit and vegetable intake (>3.8 servings/d) were significantly less likely to have breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.78) as compared with women in the lowest quartile of intake (<2.3 servings/d). Egg consumption was also significantly inversely associated with risk of breast cancer (odds ratio for >6.0 eggs/wk versus <2.0 eggs/wk is 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.91). There was no difference in soy consumption between cases and controls. None of the associations with a single botanical family explained the strong inverse relationship between fruits and vegetables and breast cancer risk.

Welsh","Regulation of the human Vitamin D3 receptor promoter in breast cancer cells is mediated through Sp1 sites","1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the active form of Vitamin D, mediates gene transcription through the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear receptor expressed in multiple normal and transformed cell types. In mammary epithelial cells, including those derived from breast cancers, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces growth arrest and/or apoptosis through VDR dependent mechanisms, and VDR agonists represent potential therapeutic agents for hyperproliferative diseases, including cancer. Since target cell sensitivity to 1,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs reflects VDR expression, understanding the transcriptional regulation of the VDR gene is fundamental to development of VDR agonists as therapeutic agents. The studies reported here focused on molecular characterization of the promoter region upstream of exon 1c in the human VDR gene. In transient transfection assays, luciferase reporter constructs containing -800 to +31 of the VDR gene exhibit basal promoter activity in T47D breast cancer cells which is enhanced by 1,25(OH)2D3, estrogen and the phytoestrogen resveratrol. Deletion constructs and site-directed mutagenesis were used to map three distinct GC-rich Sp1 consensus sites that independently mediate the effects of estrogen, resveratrol, and 1,25(OH)2D3 on VDR promoter activity. Up-regulation of the VDR promoter by 1,25(OH)2D3 was mapped to an Sp1 site 261 bp upstream of exon 1c, estrogen responsiveness to a proximal Sp1 site beginning at -50, and resveratrol regulation to a distal Sp1 site beginning at -381. Studies with estrogen receptor (ER) subtype specific ligands suggest that the effect of estrogen on VDR promoter is dependent on both ERalpha and ERbeta, whereas the effect of resveratrol is dependent only on ERalpha. In summary, these studies demonstrate transcriptional regulation of the exon 1c VDR promoter in breast cancer cells, and identify three distinct GC-rich, Sp1 consensus sites that differentially confer responsiveness to estrogen, resveratrol and 1,25(OH)2D3. 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Shupnik","The estrogen receptor (ER)alpha variant 5 exhibits dominant positive activity on ER-regulated promoters in endometrial carcinoma cells","Estrogen receptor (ER)alpha is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that mediates the physiological effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2). In the uterus, E2 is involved in tissue growth, maintenance, and differentiation. 5ERalpha (5) is an ERalpha variant protein expressed in uterine tumors but not in normal tissue. We examined the transcriptional activity of 5 and its modulation of human ERalpha basal and E2-stimulated activity in Ishikawa cells, an endometrial cancer cell line. In transient transfection assays, 5 increased basal activity of an estrogen response element-containing promoter in the absence or presence of ERalpha but lessened stimulation by ERalpha and E2. Effects of 5 were not limited to model reporters, given that cyclin D1 and complement 3 promoters were similarly affected. Increases in basal transcription required dimerization and DNA binding of 5, whereas decreased E2 stimulation with ERalpha required only DNA binding. Decreased ligand stimulation was not unique to E2 but also applied to the selective ER modulators tamoxifen and genistein. However, promoter stimulation by epidermal growth factor is retained with 5. The ERalpha coactivator small nuclear ring finger protein is expressed in Ishikawa cells and uterine tumors, and it enhances effects of 5 alone and with ERalpha on basal activity of an estrogen response element reporter. Thus, in the presence of 5 plus ERalpha, there is a lower transcriptional response to E2 and SERMS, but stimulation by epidermal growth factor is retained. The expression of 5 in uterine carcinoma may provide a mechanism by which tumors could maintain expression of E2-responsive genes in the absence of E2.",NA,"article cell line controlled study dimerization DNA binding *endometrium carcinoma *endometrium cell estrogen responsive element gene expression human human cell priority journal protein expression tissue differentiation tissue growth uterus carcinoma uterus tumor complement component C3 cyclin D1 epidermal growth factor estradiol *estrogen receptor alpha genistein selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen transcription factor","751-759","146","2005",-1

Parental generations were exposed over 9 months to these phytoestrogens and their offspring were exposed via gestation and lactation. Parents and their offspring were sampled 21 days after the birth of the kits. Sex hormone levels, sperm quality, organ weights, and development of the kits were examined. The exposed females were heavier than the control females at the 1st postnatal day (PND). The control kits were heavier than the exposed kits from the 1st to the 21st PND. Phytoestrogens did not affect the organ weights of the adult minks, but the relative testicular weight of the exposed kits was higher than in the control kits. The relative prostate weight was higher and the relative uterine weight lower in the beta-sitosterol-exposed kits than in the control kits. Moreover, the plasma dihydrotestosterone levels were lower in the genistein-exposed male kits compared to the control male kits. This study could not explain the mechanisms behind these alterations. The results indicate that perinatal phytoestrogen exposures cause alterations in the weight of the reproductive organs of the mink kits. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Lin","Degradation of HER2/neu by apigenin induces apoptosis through cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells","We have shown that exposure of the HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells to apigenin resulted in induction of apoptosis by depleting HER2/neu protein and, in turn, suppressing the signaling of the HER2/HER3-PI3K/Akt pathway. Here, we examined whether inhibition of this pathway played a role in the anti-tumor effect. The results revealed that treatment with apigenin induced apoptosis through cytochrome c release and caused a rapid induction of caspase-3 activity and stimulated proteolytic cleavage of DFF-45. Furthermore, apigenin downregulated cyclin D1, D3 and Cdk4 and increased p27 protein levels. Colony formation in the soft agar assay, a hallmark of the transformation phenotype, was preferentially suppressed in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells in the presence of apigenin. In addition, a structure-activity relationship study indicated that (1) the position of B ring; and (2) the existence of the 3', 4'-hydroxyl group on the 2-phenyl group were important for the depletion of HER2/neu protein by flavonoids.

Sastry","Aromatase inhibitors: A new paradigm in breast cancer treatment","Microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzyme aromatase belongs to CYP 19 super family. It is involved in the conversion of androgens to estrogens. In postmenopausal women the main sites of aromatisation are skin, adipose tissue and breast. Aromatase localized in breast tumor produces sufficient estrogen for its proliferation. Hence it is an important target for the treatment of hormone dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. There are mainly two types of aromatase inhibitors, one is steroidal another is nonsteroidal type. The first and second generation aromatase inhibitors encounter the undesirable drug- drug interactions besides being not very specific and plagued with pharmacokinetic problems. Third generation aromatase inhibitors developed recently are more potent and specific with a greater capacity to annihilate circulating estrogen levels. These agents have satisfactory pharmacokinetic profiles and are devoid of major drug-drug interactions. Third generation aromatase inhibitors became drugs of choice for both first and second line treatment of advanced breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors can also be used for neoadjuvant therapy of breast cancer in which they have achieved better therapeutic efficacy than tamoxifen. Early results of ATAC (Armidex Tamoxifen Alone or Combination) trial suggest that anastrozole is superior to tamoxifen in adjuvant setting for disease free survival, particularly in receptor positive patients, and in reducing the incidence of contralateral breast cancer. Therapeutic potential of aromatase inhibitors stretches beyond the postmenopausal breast cancer treatment as they also play a role in the treatment of estrogen dependent benign and malignant conditions such as gynaecomastia, prostate cancer, fibroadenomata and the induction of ovulation. By virtue of their ability to reduce estrogen levels they pose problems like demineralization of bone, hot flushes and anti-implantation effects. 2004 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",NA,"adrenal

The main adverse effect jeopardizing the clinical usage of estrogen is the increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer. Zearalenone (ZEN) is a universal endogenous hormone possessing estrogen-like effects and facilitating plant growth. alpha-Zearalanol (alpha-ZAL), a new phytoestrogen, is a reductive product of ZEN. Our preliminary evidence suggested that alpha-ZAL is anti-atherosclerotic. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of alpha-ZAL on atherosclerotic formation and serum lipid profile. Adult female nulliparous rabbits were ovariectomized or sham-operated and fed a high-cholesterol diet with different doses of alpha-ZAL or 17beta-estradiol for 12 wk. The aortic intimal atherosclerotic plaque was significantly larger in the cholesterol-fed group compared to control and sham groups. alpha-ZAL and 17beta-estradiol treatments significantly reduced plaque formation and improved serum profile of lipid (TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C) and lipoprotein (ApoAl and ApoB). Both alpha-ZAL and 17beta-estradiol reconciled ovariectomy-induced uterine atrophy, although alpha-ZAL was significantly less potent than 17beta-estradiol in stimulating uterine growth. Our findings indicate that the phytoestrogen alpha-ZAL has an important anti-atherogenic property, analogous to that of estrogen. 2004 by Humana Press Inc.

HRT has a beneficial effect on bone, but few trials in humans have investigated the effects of isoflavones on bone. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the effect on bone density of a red clover-derived isoflavone supplement that provided a daily dose of 26 mg biochanin A, 16 mg formononetin, 1 mg genistein, and 0.5 mg daidzein for 1 y. Effects on biochemical markers of bone turnover and body composition were also studied. Design: Women aged 49-65 y (n = 205) were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial; 177 completed the trial. Bone density, body composition, bone turnover markers, and diet were measured at baseline and after 12 mo. Results: Loss of lumbar spine bone mineral content and bone mineral density was significantly (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively) lower in the women taking the isoflavone supplement than in those taking the placebo. There were no significant treatment effects on hip bone mineral content or bone mineral density, markers of bone resorption, or body composition, but bone formation markers were significantly increased (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and N-propeptide of collagen type I, respectively) in the intervention group compared with placebo in postmenopausal women. Interactions between treatment group and menopausal status with respect to changes in other outcomes were not significant. Conclusion: These data suggest that, through attenuation of bone loss, isoflavones have a potentially protective effect on the lumbar spine in women. 2004 American Society for Clinical Nutrition.",NA,"adult article body composition *bone density bone mineral bone turnover clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study diet supplementation double blind procedure drug determination drug effect female health status hip human lumbar spine menopause ossification osteolysis protection randomized controlled trial red clover treatment outcome alkaline phosphatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] amino terminal telopeptide/ec [Endogenous Compound] biochanin A/ct [Clinical Trial] biochanin A/do [Drug Dose] biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] biochemical marker/ec [Endogenous Compound] daidzein/ct [Clinical Trial] daidzein/do [Drug Dose] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] formononetin/ct [Clinical Trial] formononetin/do [Drug Dose] formononetin/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] genistein/do [Drug Dose] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone/do [Drug Dose] *isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] *phytoestrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *phytoestrogen/do [Drug Dose] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] placebo","326-333","79","2004",1

It is the major lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant in the body, protecting the integrity of membranes by inhibiting lipid peroxidation. Mostly on the basis of symptoms of primary vitamin E deficiency, it has been demonstrated that vitamin E has a central role in maintaining neurological structure and function. Orally supplemented vitamin E reaches the cerebrospinal fluid and brain. Vitamin E is a generic term for all tocopherols and their derivatives having the biological activity of RRR-alpha-tocopherol, the naturally occurring stereoisomer compounds with vitamin E activity. In nature, eight substances have been found to have vitamin E activity: alpha-, beta-, - and -tocopherol; and alpha-, beta-, - and -tocotrienol. Often, the term vitamin E is synonymously used with alpha-tocopherol. Tocotrienols, formerly known as , , or -tocopherols, are similar to tocopherols except that they have an isoprenoid tail with three unsaturation points instead of a saturated phytyl tail. Although tocopherols are predominantly found in corn, soybean, and olive oils, tocotrienols are particularly rich in palm, rice bran, and barley oils. Tocotrienols possess powerful antioxidant, anticancer, and cholesterol-lowering properties. Recently, we have observed that alpha-tocotrienol is multi-fold more potent than alpha-tocopherol in protecting HT4 and primary neuronal cells against toxicity induced by glutamate as well as by a number of other toxins. At nanomolar concentration, tocotrienol, but not tocopherol, completely protected neurons by an antioxidant-independent mechanism. Our current work identifies two major targets of tocotrienol in the neuron: c-Src kinase and 12-lipoxygenase. Dietary supplementation studies have established that tocotrienol, fed orally, does reach the brain. The current findings point towards tocotrienol as a potent neuroprotective form of natural vitamin E. 2004 New York Academy of Sciences.",NA,"*alpha tocopherol deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy] animal model antineoplastic activity antioxidant activity brain breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cardiovascular disease/pc [Prevention] central nervous system conference paper *diet supplementation human hypercholesterolemia/pc [Prevention] hypertension/pc [Prevention] lipid peroxidation liver tumor/pc [Prevention] nerve cell *neuroprotection *neurotoxicity/et [Etiology] *neurotoxicity/pc [Prevention] nonhuman *alpha tocopherol/an [Drug Analysis] *alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] *alpha tocopherol/po [Oral Drug Administration] *alpha tocotrienol/an [Drug Analysis] *alpha tocotrienol/dt [Drug Therapy] *alpha tocotrienol/po [Oral Drug Administration] antioxidant/po [Oral Drug Administration] apolipoprotein B cholesterol DNA glutamic acid/to [Drug Toxicity] glutathione hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase messenger RNA mitogen activated protein kinase mitogen activated protein kinase 1 mitogen activated protein kinase 3 mitogen activated protein kinase kinase protein kinase p60","127-142","1031","2004",-1

"2013","1989"," W. J. Wooten, W. Price","Consensus report of the National Medical Association: The role of dairy and dairy nutrients in the diet of African Americans","INTRODUCTION: About the National Medical Association. As the nation's oldest and largest organization representing physicians of African descent in the United States and the Caribbean, the National Medical Association (NMA), established in 1895, is recognized as the collective voice of more than 30,000 physicians and the patients they serve. In the quest to advocate for patients, the NMA has traditionally established national health policy related to issues affecting health and well-being. Given this historical background and continued conviction, the association has committed efforts and resources to examine the role of dairy and dairy nutrients in the African-American diet. Statement of the Problem: Food preferences and misconceptions regarding dairy consumption may be hindering African Americans from attaining optimal health. Current research on calcium and other nutrients specifically derived from dairy food sources (including phosphorus, vitamin D, protein, potassium, and magnesium) establishes that these nutrients have played important roles in maintaining low body fat; reducing high blood pressure and the risk of hypertension; and preventing some cancers, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and osteoporosis. Purpose: Given the historical association between African Americans and lactose intolerance, the purpose of this consensus paper is to examine the literature to determine the value of calcium and other dairy nutrients, clarify the associated health benefits derived from dairy consumption, and investigate dairy consumption habits of African Americans. The ultimate goal of this exercise is to generate a consensus report that ascertains if dairy and its nutrients are beneficial food sources in the diet of the African-American population. METHODOLOGY: The staff of the Program Grants Management, Research and Professional Medical Affairs of the NMA reviewed the literature in the topic areas of concern. A preliminary document was generated and made available for the Consensus Panel Committee. The consensus panel then reviewed the prepared draft statement. A meeting of the consensus panel was convened from September 12-14, 2003, in San Diego, CA, where the panel deliberated and formed workgroups to develop recommendations based on the evidence of the current literature. The panel additionally created a list of specific areas for further assessment. Over the following year, contributions from professional health writers, committee review, and NMA section chairs' review further enhanced the development of the paper. As a result, the recommendations take into consideration review of the latest research findings as of September 2004. The key elements determined for incorporation in the consensus paper include: * Nutrients found in dairy products, * Associated benefits from nutrients found in dairy, * Issues of lactose intolerance in the African-American population, and * Research related to dairy consumption in the African-American diet. To analyze the data related to dairy food consumption habits of African Americans, the NMA examined data from several dairy food intake studies, including the National Panel Data (NPD) Group Diet Intake Estimation Tool (DIET) database and the NPD Group National Eating Trends (NET) database. Additionally, the NMA used the dairy food consumption profile data contained in the African-American Lactose Intolerance Understanding Study (AALIUS), which, as of this printing, is an unpublished quantitative consumer research study conducted by NPD Foodworld among a nationally representative sample of African-American adults. FINDINGS: Recent research shows that there is a clear beneficial relationship between a healthy diet of three-to-four daily servings of low-fat dairy products and the reduction of obesity and hypertension, as well as risk reduction for several diseases that affect African Americans disproportionately. The evidence is suggestive, but less clear, for certain cancers and osteoporosis in African-American women. Nonetheless, significant barriers exist which prevent the achievement of this dietary recommendation. Eighty-six percent of African Americans get just more than half of the daily recommended amount of calcium, and only half consume one or more servings of dairy a day. Of particular concern, 83% of African-American children 2-17 years if age are not getting enough calcium. New research, including unpublished data from the AALIUS looked at the reasons behind this trend. One reason is that some African Americans are lactose intolerant or experience symptoms due to lactose maldigestion; however, a surprising discovery showed that the prevalence is much lower than previous estimates. New data from AALIUS show that more than 75% of African Americans do not consider themselves to be lactose intolerant, and African Americans who consume medium-to-high amounts of dairy foods per day (more than one serving) are less likely to experience symptoms. Based on evidence in the literature, the consensus panel supports the recommendation that African Americans should get three-to-four servings of low-fat dairy a day - coupled with a balanced diet and regular moderate physical activity - to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. These findings are based on research that suggests calcium and other components of dairy products provide significant health benefits; may play a role in weight management, when consumed as part of a calorie reduced diet; and could lead to significant healthcare cost savings. DISCUSSION: As the NMA continues to tackle the challenge to increase public awareness about the potential value of dairy consumption, researchers are tasked with the challenge to conduct further studies to understand cultural barriers that influence the dietary habits of African Americans. The NMA suggests that AALIUS may be the first study to explore potential sociological and cultural issues that shape African-American dietary patterns and examine resulting nutritional implications. The finding that fewer African Americans than expected perceived themselves to be lactose intolerant was indeed a surprise element of the AALIUS research. Despite the lactose intolerance or maldigestion phenomenon, many African Americans can successfully consume dairy products by following simple tips: 1) Consume milk in small portions with food (about 1/4 to 1/2 glass); 2) Consume hard cheeses, such as cheddar or Swiss (one-and-one-half ounces are equal to a serving); and 3) Consume live-culture yogurt. Initially, following these simple rules of thumb can help reduce or eliminate the symptoms seen with lactose intolerance or maldigestion. To further contribute to the body of science concerning dairy consumption and health benefits, more research in African Americans is needed to examine the beneficial health effect of dairy consumption and the parallel barrier to dairy consumption as a result of perceived or actual lactose intolerance. RECOMMENDATIONS: After an extensive review of the literature, the NMA consensus panel made recommendations to improve and understand the role of dairy and dairy nutrients in the diet of African Americans. These recommendations are collapsed into six specific categories related to dietary guidelines, strategic planning, partnership/collaboration, research, food industry and dissemination of information. Of these recommendations, the panel resolved that the most important first step was to make recommendations regarding dietary guidelines. They are as follows: * African Americans should adopt lifestyle choices consistent with current National Academy of Sciences (NAS) guidelines relating to physical activity and healthful eating, including: * Increased fruits/vegetables and fiber; * Increased physical activity; * Decreased fat, especially saturated and trans fats; * Adequate intake relative to energy need; and * Increased low-fat dairy consumption of milk, aged cheeses or live-culture yogurt. * Based on scientific evidence, the NMA consensus panel agrees with the current guidelines for dairy consumption. As such, based on age for otherwise healthy individuals, the American public as a whole and African Ame icans in particular, should consume three-to-four servings per day of low-fat milk, cheese and/or yogurt (i.e., three servings per day for children, adults and pregnant women; four servings for adolescents and adults over 50 years old). * The public should also be educated about the importance of including other calcium-rich foods, such as leafy green vegetables (i.e., turnip greens, kale, collards), sardines and salmon, tofu and fortified soy products, and other calcium-fortified food sources in the diet. * For those individuals who cannot tolerate dairy products in the form of low-fat milk, cheese, or yogurt, lactose-free milk may be an alternative option to obtain needed calcium and other important nutrients.",NA,"*African American breast cancer cancer cardiovascular disease colon cancer conference paper consensus dairy product *diet food intake health promotion heart disease hypertension lactose intolerance metabolic syndrome X milk obesity organization osteoporosis ovary cancer priority journal prophylaxis prostate cancer risk factor calcium magnesium phosphorus potassium protein vitamin D","1S-31S","96","2004",-1

Edwards","Gene expression profiles for detecting and distinguishing potential endocrine-disrupting compounds in environmental samples","Industrial and municipal processes may produce and release endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) into the environment, but the exact nature of their effects is difficult to investigate. EDCs typically exert their effect by affecting gene expression aberrantly. To determine if gene expression profiles could be used to detect and distinguish estrogenic EDCs, an estrogen receptor positive human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was exposed to known estrogenic compounds, suspected EDCs, and extracts from three effluent samples. A set of specifically estrogen-regulated genes was identified by microarray analysis. Nine estrogen up-regulated genes (IGFBP4, HSPA8, B4GALT1, XBP1, KRT8, GTPBP4, HNRPAB, SLC2A1, and CALM1) and two estrogen down-regulated genes (ID2 and ZNF217) were consistently detectable in response to estrogen and other estrogenic compounds. Gene expression patterns in cells that were exposed to effluent sample extracts were compared to gene expression patterns in cells that were exposed to known endocrines. Using this technique, two of the effluent samples were shown to have estrogenic activity. This approach could easily be extended to screen for other types of receptor-mediated endocrine disruption. For example, cells expressing androgen or aryl hydrocarbon receptors could be used in gene expression profiling assays to detect androgenic effects or for the presence of bioactive aromatic hydrocarbons. Gene expression profiling is emerging as a sensitive and specific method to screen complex samples for endocrine disrupting activity.",NA,"article cell strain MCF 7 DNA microarray *effluent toxicity *gene expression profiling gene induction human human cell nucleotide sequence 1,1,1 trichloro 2 (2 chlorophenyl) 2 (4 chlorophenyl)ethane/to [Drug Toxicity] 4-hydroxytamoxifen/to [Drug Toxicity] 4 nonylphenol/to [Drug Toxicity] 4 octylphenol/to [Drug Toxicity] androstanolone/to [Drug Toxicity] cholesterol/to [Drug Toxicity] diethylstilbestrol/to [Drug Toxicity] estradiol/to [Drug Toxicity] estriol/to [Drug Toxicity] *estrogen/to [Drug Toxicity] ethinylestradiol/to [Drug Toxicity] fulvestrant/to [Drug Toxicity] genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] progesterone/to [Drug Toxicity] sitosterol/to [Drug Toxicity] stigmasterol/to [Drug Toxicity] testosterone/to [Drug Toxicity]","6396-6406","38","2004",-1

Intrathyroidal SULTs may contribute to the processing of thyroid hormones for the reutilization of iodide. SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 activities were identified in normal and diseased human thyroid glands. Biochemical properties that included apparent K m values, thermal stabilities, and responses to inhibitors were characterized in a normal human thyroid high speed supernatant pool. Apparent Km values for SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 activities with the model substrates p-nitrophenol and dopamine were 0.58 + 0.04 and 11.3 + 1.3 muM, respectively. Activities of SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 determined in individual normal thyroid (n = 35), nodular goiter (n = 26), and autoimmune thyroid disease (n = 25) glands were 0.34 + 0.06, 0.52 + 0.09, and 0.82 + 0.19 U/mg protein for SULT1A1, respectively, and 0.22 + 0.04, 0.21 + 0.04, and 0.48 + 0.11 U/mg protein for SULT1A3, respectively. Both SULT activities in autoimmune thyroid disease glands were significantly higher than those in normal thyroids. Only 3,3'- diiodothyronine (3,3'-T2) and the phytoestrogen daidzein served as substrates for the normal thyroid SULT activities, yet each thyroid hormone and phytoestrogen tested were found to inhibit thyroid SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 activities. The preference of thyroid gland SULT activities for 3,3'-T2 suggests that sulfation may enhance degradation of intrathyroidal 3,3'-T2 for iodide reutilization. Inhibition of these SULT activities by the exogenous phytoestrogens daidzein and genistein, with a potential decrease in iodide reutilization, presents another mechanism through which these compounds may adversely affect human thyroid function.",NA,"article controlled study degradation enzyme activity enzyme inhibition enzyme specificity enzyme substrate complex *Graves disease *Hashimoto disease hormone metabolism human human tissue Michaelis constant *nodular goiter priority journal *sulfation supernatant thermostability *thyroid gland 3,3' diiodothyronine/to [Drug Toxicity] 4 nitrophenol *aryl sulfotransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *aryl sulfotransferase 1A1/ec [Endogenous Compound] *aryl sulfotransferase 1A3/ec [Endogenous Compound] daidzein/to [Drug Toxicity] dopamine genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] liothyronine/to [Drug Toxicity] *phytoestrogen/to [Drug Toxicity] recombinant hormone/to [Drug Toxicity] recombinant liothyronine/to [Drug Toxicity] *thyroid hormone/to [Drug Toxicity] thyroxine/to [Drug Toxicity] unclassified drug","5597-5605","89","2004",-1

Lou","Proliferation-stimulating effects of icaritin and desmethylicaritin in MCF-7 cells","Icariin, icaritin and desmethylicaritin are constituents of Epimedium with a similar structure to genistein and daidzein. Using the modified MCF-7 cell proliferation assay (E-SCREEN assessment system), these compounds were tested for their estrogen-like activities. Icaritin and desmethylicaritin, but not icariin, strongly stimulated the proliferation of MCF-7/BUS cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the proliferation stimulatory effect was associated with a marked increase in the number of MCF-7/BUS cells in S phase and a significant increase in the G2/M population, with effects similar to those of estradiol. These actions were dose dependent (range from 1 nM to 10 muM) and could be significantly inhibited by the specific estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 [7 alpha-[9(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl)-estra-1,3,5(10)- triene-3,17beta-diol)]. The estrogen receptor-regulated progesterone receptor and PS2 mRNA levels were increased by treatment with icaritin or desmethylicaritin within 24 h and the effects were also reversed by ICI 182,780. It was concluded that icaritin and desmethylicaritin are novel phytoestrogens and that the estrogenic effects of icaritin and desmethylicaritin are mediated by the estrogen receptor. 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Morphological and morphometrical modulation of the bladder by estrogen are known. Yet data showing that this translates into changes of in vivo function of the urinary bladder are missing. Methods: We measured urodynamic parameters in anaesthetized, surviving rats. Following ovariectomy animals were divided into three groups and fed either an estradiol-, raloxifene-, or unsupplemented soy-free formula for ten weeks. Via a transurethral catheter the intravesical pressure was recorded during a stretch period (the urinary bladder was filled), and a one-minute isometric accommodation period immediately after the filling period. Upon termination of the experiment upper and lower halves of the bladder were processed histologically. Results: The estrogen-, and raloxifene-treated animals showed significantly higher pressures in responses to rapid stretch. Bladder compliance during the isometric period on the other hand was not significantly affected by these treatments. Thickness of the epithelial layer, collagen content and muscle bundles were significantly increased by estrogen and raloxifene treatment. Conclusions: This is a good animal model to investigate modulation of detrusor muscle contractility and stiffness. Both estradiol and raloxifene increase bladder contractility. Urinary bladder morphology indicates that estrogen acts primarily in the upper half of this organ since significant effects on collagen content and muscle fibers are only found in this part.",NA,"aging animal tissue article bladder compliance bladder epithelium bladder filling bladder function bladder muscle bladder pressure *bladder wall controlled study detrusor muscle drug effect estrogen activity female histology in vivo study modulation muscle isometric contraction nonhuman ovariectomy postmenopause priority journal protein content rat thickness urine catheter urine incontinence/et [Etiology] urodynamics urogenital aging collagen *estradiol/po [Oral Drug Administration] *estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] *raloxifene/po [Oral Drug Administration] *raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology]","514-519","112","2004",-1

To investigate the relationship between diet and prostate cancer (CaP) among native Japanese (NJ) and second-generation or third-generation Japanese-American (J-A) men - focusing on the effects of animal fat and soy on prostatic tissues. The subjects were 50 Japanese men undergoing radical prostatectomy, 25 NJ living in Nagoya, Japan and 25 U.S.-born J-A men, living in Los Angeles, California. A priori, the NJ men were believed to be a low-fat, high-soy group and the J-A men, a high-fat, low-soy group. The studies included postoperative measurements of diet (Block questionnaire), body fat (bioimpedance), blood, urine, and prostatic biomarkers in malignant and adjacent normal tissue, using a tissue microarray made from the original paraffin blocks. The NJ and J-A men were similar in age (65 to 70 years old; P <0.05), prostate-specific antigen level (7.1 to 8.6 ng/mL), prostate volume (35 to 38 cm3), and Gleason score (5.6 to 6.6), but their body composition differed. J-A men had more body fat (24% versus 19%), higher serum triglyceride levels (245 versus 106 mg/dL), lower estradiol levels (27 versus 31 ng/mL), and much lower urinary soy-metabolite levels (1:3) than NJ men (P <0.02). In both NJ and J-A groups, expression of numerous tissue biomarkers separated normal from CaP tissue, including markers for apoptosis (Bcl-2, caspase-3), growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor receptor), racemase, 5-lipoxygenase, kinase inhibition (p27), and cell proliferation (Ki-67; all P <0.02). Furthermore, within both normal and CaP tissues, caspase-3 and 5-lipoxygenase were expressed more in NJ than in J-A men (P <0.01). Nuclear morphometry showed that the chromatin in each of the four groups (normal versus CaP, NJ versus J-A) was different (area under the curve 85% to 94%, P <0.01), despite fundamental genetic homogeneity. NJ and J-A men, products of similar genetics but differing environments, were shown to have differences in body composition that could influence CaP evolution. The CaP specimens from the NJ and J-A men were histologically similar, but tissue biomarker expression, especially of lipoxygenase and the caspase family, suggested differing mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Differences in nuclear morphometry suggested the additional possibility of gene-nutrient interactions. 2004 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"adult aged apoptosis area under the curve article Asian American blood body composition body fat cancer tissue cell proliferation chromatin clinical article controlled study *diet ethnic group human human tissue impedance Japan low fat diet male measurement metabolite morphometrics nutrient organ size postoperative period priority journal *prostate cancer/et [Etiology] *prostate cancer/su [Surgery] prostatectomy protein expression questionnaire scoring system triacylglycerol blood level United States urine Western Hemisphere arachidonate 5 lipoxygenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] biological marker/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] epidermal growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] paraffin prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein bcl 2/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein p27/ec [Endogenous Compound] racemase/ec [Endogenous Compound] soybean protein triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","765-771","64","2004",-1

Utilizing a novel antibody array, we identified constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 in cells expressing the 2B mutation but not wild-type RET. MET or RON with the 2B mutation also constitutively phosphorylated STAT3. Members of the EPH, the only group of wild-type RTK that carry Thrp+1loop residue, are often expressed unexpectedly in different types of cancers. Ectopic expression of wild-type but not Thrp+1loop->Met substituted EPH family members constitutively phosphorylated STAT3. In both RTKMetp+1loop with 2B mutation and wild-type EPH members the Thrp+1loop residue is required for constitutive kinase autophosphorylation and STAT3 recruitment. In multiple endocrine neoplasia 2B (MEN-2B) patients expressing RETM918T, nuclear enrichment of STAT3 and elevated expression of CXCR4 was detected in metastatic thyroid C-cell carcinoma in the liver. In breast adenocarcinoma cell lines expressing multiple EPH members, STAT3 constitutively bound to the promoters of MUC1, MUC4, and MUC5B genes.

EPIDEMIOLOGY: More than 75% of women experience hot flashes during perimenopause and more than 25% remain symptomatic for longer than 5 years. Vasomotor symptoms constitute the primary reason women seek medical care during this time. REVIEW SUMMARY: Menopause brings a unique set of issues, including hot flashes, depressed mood, and vaginal dryness. Of these, vasomotor symptoms are often the most debilitating for women and create a challenge for physicians. Coping mechanisms are a reasonable treatment choice for women with mild symptoms but are frequently inadequate to restore functionality to women with moderate to severe symptoms. Hormone therapy is the most effective management option for hot flashes. Other proven, albeit less efficacious, pharmacologic options do exist. These include serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, and alpha2-adrenergic agents. Finally, ""natural"" alternatives have surged in popularity, as many women have turned to over-the-counter vitamins and herbal products. Scant short-term data exist for few of these popular dietary supplements. TYPE OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE: Systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control series, nationally recognized treatment guidelines. GRADE OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE: Poor to good. CONCLUSION: Many useful modalities exist for the treatment of menopausal vasomotor symptoms, with hormone therapy being the most effective.

"2043","2019"," V. Stearns","Management of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors and men with prostate cancer","Hot flashes are a significant complaint among many breast cancer survivors and many men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Several therapeutic approaches are available to the suffering man or woman. Many of these individuals have tried nonpharmacologic and nonconventional approaches. However, most nonpharmacologic treatments have not been compared with placebo or were not more effective than placebo in prospective, randomized clinical trials. The most effective nonhormonal treatments for hot flashes include agents from the selective serotonin or noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SSRI/SNRI) family. Paroxetine, 10 mg/d, or venlafaxine, 37.5 mg/d, are reasonable initial dosages, and if symptoms do not improve within a week or two, the dosage can be doubled. Gabapentin appears to provide similar benefits, but direct comparisons have not been reported. Because of the strong association between gonadal hormones and breast and prostate cancer, the use of hormonal agents to treat hot flashes in these patients has been limited. However, such hormonal therapies as depomedroxyprogesterone acetate can be prescribed for an informed individual who experiences bothersome symptoms despite nonhormonal treatments.

Poole","OECD test strategies and methods for endocrine disruptors","The question whether (man-made or natural) chemical substances may have an adverse effect on the endocrine system has gained high visibility in the public as well as in the scientific community. This relates to possible effects on the environment as well as on human health for chemicals with (anti)estrogenic, (anti)androgenic or (anti)thyroid activity. Taking into account the broad universe of chemicals to which humans or the environment may be exposed, a sound testing strategy and robust test methods are urgently needed. Both subjects have been addressed by a specific OECD working group (EDTA - Endocrine Disruptor Testing and Assessment Task Force) involving regulatory agencies, the scientific community, chemical industry and NGOs. Like other organizations the OECD has adopted a tiered-testing strategy with the first tier using screening assays as quick and inexpensive tools, providing a way of generating alerts to potential endocrine activity that can be used to prioritize substances for definitive tests that then can determine the toxicological consequences of endocrine toxicity. The efforts of the OECD have therefore concentrated on the validation of specific screening and testing guidelines, like the uterotrophic, the Hershberger, and the ""enhanced TG 407"" test. The experimental testing necessary for this validation procedure is completed for the uterotrophic and the ""enhanced TG 407"" tests and near completion for the Hershberger assay. The data obtained so far have been published (for the uterotrophic assay) or will be submitted to the EDTA working group for final evaluation. Overall, the validation program has been very successful and should be sufficient for setting up OECD test guidelines for these experimental procedures. This will add substantially to the ""tool-box"" of OECD test methods that is available internationally to regulatory agencies and chemical industry for the identification and assessment of possible endocrine disruptors. Despite this success it is well recognized that the methodological ""tool-box"" should be supplemented by further screening and testing procedures related to effects on human health and the environment. 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: A total of 240 South Asian breast cancer cases living in England and 477 age-matched population-based controls were recruited into the study. Dietary intake was measured using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of phyto-oestrogen intake on breast cancer risk. Results: After adjustment for known breast cancer risk factors and total energy intake, there was moderate evidence of a dose-effect response in the odds of breast cancer with isoflavone intake (p-value for trend 0.08), with women in the top quartile having approximately half the odds of breast cancer of those in the bottom one (odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33, 1.00) but with no reductions in the odds for women in the second and third quartiles. The ORs for second, third and highest quartiles of total lignan intake compared to the lowest were 0.78 (95% CI 0.48, 1.26), 0.74 (0.46, 1.19) and 0.66 (0.41, 1.07), respectively, again with moderate evidence of a linear dose-effect response (p-value for trend 0.09). Further adjustment for non-startch polysaccharides (NSP) intake slightly weakened the phyto-oestrogens-breast cancer associations. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the possibility that high phyto-oestrogen intake may protect against breast cancer, but further research is required to confirm this hypothesis.",NA,"article *breast carcinoma cancer risk confidence interval controlled study dietary intake disease association dose response human logistic regression analysis medical research priority journal reduction risk factor South Asia United Kingdom validation process lignan/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound]","805-818","15","2004",1

About 4% of the breast cancers in developed countries are estimated to be attributable to drinking alcohol. The mechanism of tumor promotion by alcohol remains unknown. Recent studies from our laboratory and others showed the ability of mammary tissue to bioactivate ethanol to mutagenic/carcinogenic acetaldehyde and free radicals. Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is an enzyme involved in those biotransformation processes. In the present study, we provide evidence of the ability of different natural polyphenols and offolic acid derivatives to inhibit the biotransformation of alcohol to acetaldehyde by rat breast cytosolic XOR. Folic acid and dihydrofolic acid, at concentrations of 10 muM, inhibited 100% and 84%, respectively, of the cytosolic acetaldehyde formation. Thirty-five polyphenols were tested in these initial experiments: ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin, and apigenin inhibited 79-95% at muM concentrations. The remaining polyphenols were either less potent or noninhibitory of acetaldehyde formation at similar concentrations in these screening tests.

Turner","Postmenopausal hormone therapy before and after breast cancer: Clinical experiences","Conventional oestrogen-based hormone therapy (HT) increases the incidence of breast pain and tenderness, mammographic density and the risk of breast cancer. Combined oestrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) increases the risk of breast cancer to a greater degree than oestrogen alone (ET). Attention must therefore be focused on identifying women at risk of breast cancer or on producing a HT that has fewer breast side effects. Randomised controlled trials have shown that while EPT induces breast tenderness or pain in up to 50% of women and increases mammographic density in up to 70% during the first year of treatment, only about as many as one-tenth women report breast tenderness or pain with tibolone and increases in mammographic density are rare, occurring with a similar incidence as seen in untreated controls. Many women with breast cancer suffer vasomotor symptoms rather than risk recurrence with conventional HT. However, in a small randomised controlled trial in women with early breast cancer undergoing adjuvant tamoxifen treatment, tibolone reduced hot flushes, night sweats and improved quality of life compared with placebo. 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods Twenty-nine men diagnosed with prostate cancer and scheduled to undergo a radical prostatectomy were randomized to one of three groups: soy (high phytoestrogen), soy and linseed (high phytoestrogen), or wheat (low phytoestrogen). A bread was specially manufactured to incorporate 50 g of heat-treated (HT) soy grits or 50 g of HT soy grits and 20 g of linseed as part of the study participant's daily diet. Baseline and preoperative levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free PSA, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free androgen index, and dihydrotestosterone were measured. Results Statistically significant differences were detected between the HT soy grits group and the control wheat group for the percentage of change in total PSA (-12.7% versus 40%, P = 0.02) and the percentage of change in free/total PSA ratio (27.4% versus -15.6%, P = 0.01); and between the HT soy grits group and the HT soy grits and linseed group for the percentage of change in free androgen index (16.4% versus -15.5%, P = 0.04) and the percentage of change in free/total PSA ratio (27.4% versus -10%, P = 0.007). Conclusions The data from this study indicate that a daily diet containing four slices of a bread rich in HT soy grits favorably influences the PSA level and the free/total PSA ratio in patients with prostate cancer. This work provides some evidence to support epidemiologic studies claiming that male populations who consume high phytoestrogen diets have a reduced risk of prostate cancer development and progression. 2004 Elsevier Inc.",NA,"adult aged antigen detection article cancer diagnosis clinical article clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study *diet disease association *hormonal regulation human linseed male preoperative evaluation priority journal *prostate carcinoma/di [Diagnosis] prostatectomy protein determination randomization randomized controlled trial sex hormone determination soybean statistical significance androgen/ec [Endogenous Compound] androstanolone/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] *sex hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] sex hormone binding globulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound]","510-515","64","2004",-1

Gray Jr","Development and characterization of a cell line that stably expresses an estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter for the detection of estrogen receptor agonist and antagonists","Recently several advisory committees (EDSTAC, ICCVAM) have recommended that stable estrogen-dependent gene expression assays be developed for screening chemicals for estrogenic activity because of the high degree of specificity of the response and potential for use in a high-throughput mode. In this paper we describe a specific, sensitive assay developed for screening chemicals for estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. T47D human breast cancer cells, which naturally express estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta, were stably transfected with a triplet ERE (estrogen-responsive elements)-promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct. The transformed cells were named T47D-KBluc. These cells are sensitive to the potent estrogens, 17beta-estradiol, ethynyl estradiol, and diethylstibesterol, and well-characterized weaker environmental estrogens like genistein, HPTE (an estrogenic pesticide metabolite), and 4-nonylphenol. The EC50 for estradiol was about 0.01 nM, reaching maximal induction at 0.1 nM. The antiestrogen, ICI 182,780, was able to completely inhibit the induction of luciferase expression by 0.1 nM estradiol at 10 nM, with an IC50 of 1 nM. In addition, we were able to replicate, in this in vitro assay, the observation that low concentrations of cadmium were able to induce estrogen-dependent gene expression, an effect that was completely inhibited by the potent antiestrogen ICI 182,780. The potent glucocorticoid receptor agonist, dexamethasone, was without effect as an ER agonist at concentrations up to 10 nM, whereas the potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), showed no induction at concentration of 50 muM, but was a partial agonist at high concentrations of 0.2 mM and above. In summary, we have developed a specific, sensitive estrogen-responsive gene expression assay in a stable cell line that could possibly be adapted for high throughput screening of large numbers of chemicals for estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity. In addition, herein we also provide key protocol recommendations necessary to identify and eliminate common problems encountered in in vitro screening for estrogenicity.

Arici","In vivo and in vitro regulation of Akt activation in human endometrial cells is estrogen dependent","Estrogen-bound estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta classically activate gene expression after binding to the estrogen response element in the promoter regions of target genes. Estrogen also has rapid, nongenomic effects. It activates several membranous or cytoplasmic kinase cascades, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3K/Akt) cascade, a signaling pathway that plays a key role in cell survival and apoptosis. Normal human endometrium is exposed to variable levels of steroid hormones throughout the menstrual cycle. We hypothesized that Akt phosphorylation in human endometrium may vary with the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy and that fluctuations in estrogen level may play a role in Akt activation in endometrial cells. We analyzed Akt phosphorylation using in vivo and in vitro techniques, including Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunocytochemistry. Estradiol significantly increased Akt phosphorylation in endometrial cells. Rapid stimulation of Akt activation in cultured stromal cells was observed. Akt. phosphorylation by estradiol was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, but not by the ER antagonist, ICI 182 780. The maximal effect on Akt activity was observed following 5-15 min of estradiol treatment. Our results suggest that estradiol may directly affect PI3K-related signaling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of Akt in endometrial cells. Thus, estradiol may exert part of its proliferative and antiapoptotic effects by a nongenomic manner through the Akt signaling pathway.",NA,"adult apoptosis article cell survival controlled study DNA responsive element *endometrium cell *enzyme activation enzyme phosphorylation female gene expression gene targeting human human cell immunocytochemistry immunohistochemistry menstrual cycle priority journal promoter region signal transduction Western blotting estradiol *estrogen estrogen receptor alpha estrogen receptor beta fulvestrant genistein phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor phosphotransferase *protein kinase B raloxifene selective estrogen receptor modulator steroid hormone tamoxifen wortmannin","714-721","71","2004",-1

Church","Nonestrogen treatment modalities for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause","OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of nonestrogen treatments for menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms not due to cancer or chemotherapy. DATA SOURCES: Pertinent literature and clinical studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966-February 2004) and EMBASE (1959-February 2004) using the key search terms vasomotor symptoms, hot flashes, and menopause. Bibliographies of relevant articles were reviewed for additional references. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language articles reporting efficacy and safety of nonestrogen treatment modalities for perimenopausal and postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms were evaluated. All articles identified from the data sources were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was included. Emphasis was placed on randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, as these provide the best efficacy and safety data. Studies evaluating treatment of vasomotor symptoms from other causes, such as cancer or chemotherapy, were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: Prescription medications reviewed for efficacy and safety in postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms include clonidine hydrochloride, danazol, gabapentin, methyldopa, mirtazapine, progestins, propranolol hydrochloride, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and venlafaxine. Nonprescription therapies reviewed include black cohosh, dong quai, evening primrose oil, physical activity, phytoestrogens, and red clover. CONCLUSIONS: According to this systematic literature review, postmenopausal vasomotor treatments that have been shown to be safe and effective in short-term use include black cohosh, exercise, gabapentin, medroxyprogesterone acetate, SSRIs (ie, paroxetine hydrochloride), and soy protein.

Sultana","Abrogation of potassium bromate-induced renal oxidative stress and subsequent cell proliferation response by soy isoflavones in Wistar rats","Potassium bromate (KBrO3) is a potent nephrotoxic agent. In this study, we show the modulatory effect of soy isoflavones on KBrO 3-mediated renal oxidative stress and subsequent cell proliferation response in Wistar rats. KBrO3 (125 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) caused reduction in renal glutathione content, activities of renal anti-oxidant enzymes, viz., glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and phase-II metabolising enzymes such as glutathione-S-transferase and quinone reductase with enhancement in xanthine oxidase, lipid peroxidation, -glutamyl transpeptidase and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). KBrO3 treatment also induced blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and tumor promotion markers, viz., ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and thymidine [3H] incorporation into renal DNA. Treatment of rats orally with soy isoflavones (5 mg/kg body weight and 10 mg/kg body weight) resulted in a significant decrease in xanthine oxidase (P<0.05), lipid peroxidation, -glutamyl transpeptidase, H2O2 generation, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, renal ODC activity and DNA synthesis (P<0.001).

Paimela","Regulation of restitution after superficial injury in isolated guinea pig gastric mucosa","The immediate response of the gastrointestinal epithelium to superficial (i.e. microscopic) injury is primarily directed towards restoring the disturbed epithelial continuity. Both structural (i.e. cytoskeleton) and humoral (i.e. growth factors and cytokines) involvement in the process has recently been documented. Yet it is unclear whether humoral signaling regulating mucosal recovery after superficial injury is associated with tyrosine phosphorylation, and whether there are other signs of downstream activation of the signaling pathway. To evaluate the effects of exogenous genistein and phorbol-myristate acetate in the assessment of the role of tyrosine receptor-mediated signaling in the immediate repair of gastric mucosa after superficial injury. Guinea pig gastric mucosa was mounted in a Ussing chamber, injured with 1.25 M NaCl, and perfused for 4 h. Simultaneously, potential difference and tissue resistance were recorded. In some sets of experiments the tissue was exposed bilaterally either to genistein in order to inhibit tyrosine receptor-mediated signaling or to 4-phorbol-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in order to enhance PKC signaling during the 4 h recovery. Phosphotyrosine (PTYR) and protein kinase C (PKC) immunoreactivity were assessed by immunoblotting and by immunohistochemistry. Proliferative activity was determined morphometrically after staining of the tissue for Ki-67 nuclear antigen and expressed as proliferative index (PI). The inhibition of tyrosine kinases with exogenous genistein resulted in a significant decrease of the PTYR and the stimulation of PKC with PMA increased the PTYR. Nevertheless, no change in the PTYR was observed by immunoblotting after superficial injury alone. Several PKC isoenzymes were found in the guinea pig gastric mucosa, including PKC-alpha, -, - and -. They were unaffected either by the injury or the PMA treatment. The mean PI of tissues subjected to NaCl-injury was higher than that of uninjured control tissues (p<0.05) (n=7). Exposure of tissue to genistein during recovery decreased the PI, while stimulation with PMA increased it (p<0.05 for both) (n=6). Both electrophysiologic and morphologic restitution were sensitive to genistein, but not to PMA. Superficial injury alone does not influence tyrosine phosphorylation to a degree which could be assessed by immunoblotting. Nevertheless, exogenous modulation of tyrosine receptor-mediated signaling results in downstream signaling effects. The injury-associated induction of proliferation is sensitive to modulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and PKC, suggesting that superficial epithelial injury results in endogenous activation of the epithelium, presumably after paracrine stimulation of the neighboring cells.",NA,"animal model animal tissue article cell proliferation controlled study enzyme activation epithelium guinea pig immunoblotting immunohistochemistry immunoreactivity morphometrics nonhuman priority journal protein expression protein phosphorylation signal transduction staining statistical significance *stomach injury stomach mucosa genistein isoenzyme Ki 67 antigen phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate phosphotyrosine protein kinase C protein tyrosine kinase sodium chloride tyrosine","225-232","112","2004",-1
"2069","2054"," J. M. Naciff, G. P. Daston","Toxicogenomic approach to endocrine disrupters: Identification of a transcript profile characteristic of chemicals with estrogenic activity","Public concerns have been raised in recent years over the possible adverse effects that may result from exposure to chemicals in the environment that have the potential to interfere with the normal function of the endocrine system in wildlife and humans (""endocrine disrupters""). Regulations have been established that require the testing of pesticides used in food crops and drinking water contaminants, for estrogenicity and other hormonal activities. In the United States, the U.S. EPA proposed the Endocrine Disrupter Screening Program, which consists of a Tier 1 screening battery of tests that is designed to identify chemicals capable of interacting with various hormonal systems, and different Tier 2 testing assays that are designed to verify and broaden the Tier 1 results. We identify 2 main problems with this approach: (1) the fact that the developmental stages that are the most susceptible to endocrine disruption are not represented in the screening tier, mainly because developmental effects tend to be latent, and there is no way to economically screen in developing models; and (2) the expense to screen each chemical to be included in this program. Thus, the need arises for an accurate, rapid, and cost effective method for assessing the potential endocrine activity of multiple chemicals during development. We hypothesize that the largely latent developmental effects of some endocrine disruptors are preceded by immediate changes in gene expression in the embryo and fetus. Therefore, an approach to assess the potential estrogenic (and other steroid hormonal) activity of different compounds is to identify those patterns of gene expression elicited in a tissue/organ exposed to these particular classes of chemicals. In this paper, the potential utility of such an approach for screening and better understanding of mechanism of action for specific chemicals with endocrine disrupter activities is presented, using as an example chemicals with estrogenic activity.",NA,"animal experiment animal model conference paper controlled study cost DNA microarray embryotoxicity/et [Etiology] endocrine function environmental exposure *estrogen activity female fetotoxicity/et [Etiology] food contamination *gene expression profiling *genotoxicity/et [Etiology] nonhuman *nucleotide sequence priority journal rat *reproductive toxicity/et [Etiology] toxicity testing United States water contamination *4,4' isopropylidenediphenol/to [Drug Toxicity] actin/ec [Endogenous Compound] aldehyde dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] calcium binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] carcinoembryonic antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] creatine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytokeratin 18/ec [Endogenous Compound] desmin/ec [Endogenous Compound] drinking water *ethinylestradiol/to [Drug Toxicity] Fc receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] fibronectin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] glutathione transferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] guanine deaminase/ec [Endogenous Compound] heat shock protein 27/ec [Endogenous Compound] hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] metallothionein/ec [Endogenous Compound] pesticide/to [Drug Toxicity] somatomedin binding protein 3/ec [Endogenous Compound]","59-70","32","2004",-1

Effects of genistein (GEN), resveratrol (RES), zearalenone (ZEA), bisphenol A (BPA) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) were examined. Beginning on gestational day 15, pregnant CD-1 mice were administered four daily subcutaneous injections with 0.5 or 10 mg/kg/day of GEN, RES, ZEA or BPA, 0.5 or 10 mug/kg/day of DES dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or DMSO vehicle (n = 6). Vaginal opening was monitored, 6 animals per group were autopsied at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age and estrous cyclicity was monitored from 9 to 11 weeks of age. Maternal exposure to xenoestrogen accelerated puberty onset (vaginal opening) and increased the length of the estrous cycle; mice treated with GEN, RES, BPA or DES spent more time in diestrus, and ZEA-treated mice spent more time in estrus. Lack of corpora lutea and vaginal cornification were observed at 4 weeks of age in the high-dose GEN (33%) and RES (17%) groups, and in the high- and low-dose BPA groups (33 and 50%, respectively) and DES groups (83 and 100%, respectively). Lack of corpora lutea and vaginal cornification was observed in the high-dose ZEA group at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age (83, 100, 83 and 33%, respectively). Mammary gland differentiation was accelerated in ZEA- and BPA-treated mice with corpora lutea at 4 weeks of age. ZEA-treated mice without corpora lutea showed mammary growth arrest at 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age; their mammary glands consisted only of a dilatated duct filled with secreted fluid. Mammary gland growth was similar with xenoestrogens other than ZEA or BPA to that of the controls at all time points. High-dose GEN and RES and high- and low-dose BPA and DES exerted transient effects on the reproductive tract and mammary glands, whereas ZEA exerted prolonged effects. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"2077","2069"," B. D. Cowley Jr","Recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease: Therapeutic implications","Hereditary polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common cause of renal failure. Increasing knowledge is available regarding mechanisms of cyst development and progression, and renal functional deterioration in PKD. On the basis of this information and theories regarding the pathophysiology of these processes, studies to alter progression and potentially treat PKD have been reported. Cyst development and progression requires epithelial cell proliferation, transepithelial fluid secretion and extracellular matrix remodelling. Several interventions designed to inhibit cell proliferation or alter fluid secretion modify the progression of PKD in selected animal models. Renal functional deterioration appears to involve interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, and tubular apoptosis. Glucocorticoids with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties slow the progression of cystic disease and renal functional deterioration in animal models of PKD. Other interventions, such as dietary modification and angiotensin antagonism, shown to be of benefit in non-PKD models of slowly progressive renal disease, are also of benefit in animal models of PKD. Caution should be used in extrapolating interventional studies in one animal model to another model and certainly to human disease, since examples exist in which treatments in one model of PKD have different effects in another model. Nonetheless, early attempts to determine whether potential treatments are tolerated and of potential benefit in patients with PKD are beginning to appear. Ultimately, treatment of PKD may involve efforts to identify patients at greatest risk for disease progression, thus allowing targeted therapy, use of surrogate markers for disease progression to assist assessment of therapeutic efficacy, and combination therapy to retard disease progression and renal functional deterioration in this common hereditary cause of chronic renal failure.",NA,"acidosis/dt [Drug Therapy] allele apoptosis article cell proliferation cell secretion clinical trial disease course disease marker epithelium cell extracellular matrix fibrosing alveolitis/co [Complication] gene mutation Heymann nephritis human inflammation/co [Complication] kidney disease/co [Complication] kidney disease/dt [Drug Therapy] kidney dysfunction/pc [Prevention] kidney failure/co [Complication] kidney function *kidney polycystic disease/dt [Drug Therapy] *kidney polycystic disease/et [Etiology] linseed nephrectomy nonhuman pathogenesis protein expression protein function protein restriction side effect/si [Side Effect] smoking cessation alkali/dt [Drug Therapy] alkali/to [Drug Toxicity] ammonium chloride/dt [Drug Therapy] angiotensin receptor antagonist/cb [Drug Combination] angiotensin receptor antagonist/dt [Drug Therapy] antifibrotic agent/cb [Drug Combination] antiinflammatory agent/cb [Drug Combination] antioxidant antisense oligonucleotide/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] antisense oligonucleotide/ct [Clinical Trial] antisense oligonucleotide/dt [Drug Therapy] antisense oligonucleotide/pd [Pharmacology] bicarbonate/dt [Drug Therapy] citrate potassium/dt [Drug Therapy] dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] epidermal growth factor receptor/dt [Drug Therapy] flaxseed extract/pd [Pharmacology] glucocorticoid/dt [Drug Therapy] glucocorticoid/pd [Pharmacology] hormone receptor blocking agent/dt [Drug Therapy] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] methylprednisolone/dt [Drug Therapy] mevinolin/dt [Drug Therapy] monocyte chemotactic protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester/cb [Drug Combination] mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester/dt [Drug Therapy] osteopontin/ec [Endogenous Compound] paclitaxel/dt [Drug Therapy] paclitaxel/to [Drug Toxicity] pioglitazone/dt [Drug Therapy] plant extract/pd [Pharmacology] polycystin 1/ec [Endogenous Compound] potassium bicarbonate/dt [Drug Therapy] probucol/dt [Drug Therapy] protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] soybean protein unclassified drug vasopressin V2 receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","1285-1294","64","2004",-1

Therefore, orchiectomized Wistar rats (n > 13) were treated s.c. with 1 mg/kg bw/day testosterone propionate (TP) for 7 days and compared to orchiectomized rats without TP substitution (OX) and to an untreated intact control group. Sections obtained from prostates and seminal vesicles were stained with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the androgen receptor (AR) and assessed densitometrically (intensity of the immunoreaction) and morphometrically (epithelial height, luminal area). TP caused an enhancement of staining intensity and an increase in organ weights, epithelial height and luminal area. The use of proliferation markers (PCNA, MIB-5) showed also a highly significant increase of immunoreactive cells in TP-substituted orchiectomized rats compared with the OX group. Based on the present data, the densitometric analysis of AR-immunoreactivity as well as the assessment of proliferation markers, epithelial height and luminal area proved to be sensitive parameters for the evaluation of androgen effects on prostates and seminal vesicles.

Variance in tumor histologic features, growth pattern, invasion, metastases, and multi-focality were detected in untreated and treated mice. Ninety-three percent (1,174/1,258) of tumors had the solid growth pattern widely reported in this model. However, among the solid tumors, a spectrum of growth patterns, from well-circumscribed tumors with a pseudocapsule to locally invasive or highly aggressive, metastatic subtype, was observed. Of the non-solid tumors, glandular features were prominent in 84 (7%). Adenocarcinomas included papillary, acinar/glandular, and adenosquamous subtypes. Adenosquamous tumors were exclusively observed in the group of mice treated on a short-term basis with estrogen. In contrast to the reported literature for this transgenic mouse model, mammary tumors were multifocal in the majority of cases (303 of 417 mice, or 73%).

The present study was conducted to assess the influence of dietary feeding of the endocrine disruptors atrazine and nonylphenol on DMBA-induced carcinogenesis in c-Ha-ras Tg rats. Animals of both sexes were given a single oral dose of DMBA (25 mg/kg body weight) at 50 days of age and thereafter received soybean-free diet containing 5, 50 or 500 ppm atrazine, or 10, 25, 100 or 250 ppm nonylphenol. In female Tg rats, atrazine at a dose of 5 ppm increased the incidences of mammary adenomas and adenocarcinomas (P<0.01 and P<0.05), while 50 ppm increased the adenocarcinoma incidence (P<0.05). In males, skin tumor development, in contrast, was significantly decreased at the highest dose. Nonylphenol at 10 ppm increased adenocarcinoma and total mammary tumor multiplicity in female Tg rats (P<0.05), but there was no dose dependence, a significant quadratic dose-response trend rather being observed (P<0.05). In vitro, atrazine did not cause proliferation of MCF-7 cells at any of a range of doses tested.

Therefore, it is important to recognize those groups of women who may be at higher risk for development of hypothyroidism so that serum TSH testing may be performed with appropriate initiation of thyroxine therapy. In addition, the thyroxine therapy of women with established hypothyroidism should be optimized prior to conception and during pregnancy when the thyroxine dosage requirement generally increases early in gestation.

Tobias","Transcriptional regulation of a BMP-6 promoter by estrogen receptor alpha","The effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and ICI 182,780 (ICI) on activity of a BMP-6 promoter were compared in osteoblast-like and breast cancer cells transiently transfected with ERalpha. E2 but not ICI stimulated BMP-6 reporter activity in breast cancer cells, whereas the opposite was observed in osteoblast-like cells, associated with lack of AF-2 dependence of the response, and absent intranuclear localization of ERalpha, suggesting the involvement of a distinct ERalpha-dependent response mechanism in osteoblasts. Introduction: Previous studies suggest that the tissue-selective effect of antiestrogens on bone reflects the ability of these compounds to target certain osteoblast regulatory genes. To explore this hypothesis, we examined whether antiestrogens preferentially stimulate the bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP-6) promoter in bone cells, and if so, whether this activity is associated with a distinct estrogen receptor (ER)alpha-dependent response mechanism to that in other cell types. Materials and Methods: We compared the effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and ICI 182,780 (ICI) on activity of a 4.3-kb BMP-6 reporter construct in osteoblast-like cells (human MG63 and SaOS-2 cells and rat ROS 17/2.8 cells), human MCF-7 and T47-D breast cancer cell lines, and HepG2 hepatoma cells, after transient transfection with ERalpha, ERbeta, and mutant ER constructs. Results: E2, but not ICI, stimulated BMP-6 reporter activity by approximately 100% in MCF-7, T47-D cells, and HepG2 cells when transfected with ERalpha. In contrast, in ERalpha-transfected osteoblast-like cells, an increase in reporter activity of approximately 75% was observed after treatment with ICI but not E2. The response of MG63 cells to ICI and MCF-7 cells to E2 both required ERalpha as opposed to ERbeta and the ERalpha activation function (AF)-1 activation domain. However, whereas the AF-2 domain was also required for E 2 to stimulate reporter activity in MCF-7 cells, the response to ICI in MG63 cells was AF-2 independent. In further studies where we compared the intracellular distribution of ERalpha associated with these responses, E 2-dependent stimulation of the BMP-6 reporter in MCF-7 cells was associated with intranuclear localization of ERalpha, whereas extranuclear localization was seen in rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS) cells treated with ICI.

Lampe","Soy isoflavones do not modulate prostate-specific antigen concentrations in older men in a randomized controlled trial","Mortality rates for prostate cancer are low in Asia but high in the West. One explanation is the high level of soy consumption in Asia. Soy isoflavones reduce prostate tumor growth in many, but not all, animal models. Elevated levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are a marker of prostate tumor growth. Our objective was to determine whether 12-month soy isoflavone supplementation would alter serum PSA concentrations in healthy, older men. The parent study was a double-blinded, parallel-arm, randomized trial in which participants were assigned to consume either a soy protein drink providing 83 mg/day isoflavones (+ISO) or a similar drink with isoflavones removed (-ISO). Participants in the parent study were 85% men. Of the 128 men enrolled in the trial, 112 completed. These men were later contacted for consent to allow their stored sera to be analyzed for PSA and 81 men consented. We measured PSA in serum collected at 0 and 12 months using a commercial radioimmunometric assay. Serum PSA concentrations increased in both groups over the 12-month intervention, but the changes were similar: Geometric mean PSA concentration increased 0.5% more in the +ISO group than in the -ISO group (P = 0.94; 95% confidence interval = -17.3 to 22.2). The proportion of participants having a serum PSA velocity greater than 1 ng/ml/year was similar in the +ISO and -ISO groups (17.6% versus 12.8%; P = 0.54).

Methods: Articles were identified through searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CANCERLIT. Eligible studies consisted of clinical trials of hot flash therapy in women who had been treated for breast cancer. Abstract books for recent North American oncology conferences were scanned for additional studies. Efficacy data for female subjects and patient preferences were summarized in tables. Open-label trial data were also summarized. Results: Sixteen randomized controlled trials reported efficacy data from a total of 1427 subjects, and eight of these trials reported patient preferences, for a total of 579 subjects. Seven open-label trials reported results from a total of 145 subjects. The trials reported reductions from baseline in hot flash frequency or hot flash score (mean frequency x severity). Most trials were four weeks long, and the majority of subjects were receiving tamoxifen. Conclusion: The following agents appear effective for the treatment of hot flashes in breast cancer survivors: clonidine, fluoxetine, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and venlafaxine extended-release. Little clinical benefit has been shown with black cohosh, soy phytoestrogens, and vitamin E.

In this study, we examined the effect of crude soy saponin extract on PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-induced inflammatory responses. Human adenocarinoma cells (HT-29) were treated with various concentrations of saponin extract for 72 h. Cell growth was measured at 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation, and the PMA-induced expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), protein kinase C (PKC), and IBalpha were determined. The results indicate that crude saponin extract decreased cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Crude soy saponin extract suppressed the degradation of IBalpha in PMA-stimulated cells, while COX-2 and PKC expressions were significantly down-regulated. These findings support the hypothesis that the soy saponins reduce the risk of colon tumorigenesis possibly by suppressing inflammatory responses. 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We have studied the role of flavonoids on the iodide transport and the growth of the human follicular thyroid cancer cell line (FTC133) which was stably transfected with the human Na+/I- symporter (hNIS). Design and methods: Cells were treated with flavonoids (0. 5-50 muM) for 0, 2. 4 and 6 days; 125I content and 125I efflux of the cells and DNA content were measured. Results: Cell growth was inhibited significantly at day 6 by most flavonoids. Eight out of ten flavonoids decreased the 125I content of the cells at day 4. Morin did not influence the 125I content of the cells and, surprisingly, myricetin increased the 125I content of the cells. Kaempferol, apigenin, luteolin and F21388 decreased NIS mRNA expression after 15, 29 and 48 h; after 96 h NIS mRNA returned to normal. Conclusion: As TPO is not present in this cell line, the effects of the flavonoids on the iodide uptake are not related to organification. Myricetin was the only flavonoid studied that increased the influx and decreased the efflux of iodide. The effect of myricetin (decreased growth and increased retention of iodide) can be of therapeutic value in the radioiodide treatment of th6yroid carcinoma. 2004 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.",NA,"article cancer cell culture cancer growth cancer inhibition cell transport controlled study DNA content dose response drug binding drug efficacy genetic transfection human human cell long term care priority journal statistical significance *thyroid follicular carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] *thyroid follicular carcinoma/et [Etiology] 3',5' dibromo 4',6 dihydroxy 3 methylflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] 3',5' dibromo 4',6 dihydroxy 3 methylflavone/pd [Pharmacology] apigenin/dt [Drug Therapy] apigenin/pd [Pharmacology] f 21388 fisetin/dt [Drug Therapy] fisetin/pd [Pharmacology] *flavonoid/do [Drug Dose] *flavonoid/dt [Drug Therapy] *flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *iodide/ec [Endogenous Compound] iodine 125 kaempferol/dt [Drug Therapy] kaempferol/pd [Pharmacology] luteolin/dt [Drug Therapy] luteolin/pd [Pharmacology] morin/dt [Drug Therapy] morin/pd [Pharmacology] myricetin/dt [Drug Therapy] myricetin/pd [Pharmacology] naringenin/dt [Drug Therapy] naringenin/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin/dt [Drug Therapy] quercetin/pd [Pharmacology] *sodium iodide symporter/ec [Endogenous Compound]","557-564","150","2004",-1

This overview addresses the many factors that may interfere with health and well-being in such women. Hormonal changes during the menopausal transition, finally resulting in estrogen deficiency, play a pivotal role in the incidence of climacteric symptoms and also in the development of chronic diseases. Such symptoms and diseases can contribute to impaired quality of life in climacteric and postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal hormone therapy (PHT) is the treatment of first choice to alleviate symptoms of estrogen deficiency. Besides effectively relieving climacteric symptoms and complaints, PHT can also protect against some chronic diseases, such as osteoporosis and colorectal cancer. Presently, available PHTs vary widely in type, estrogen and progestogen dosage, and route and duration of administration. Furthermore, the number of alternatives to treat climacteric symptoms, and/or to prevent chronic diseases, has increased. Therefore, doctors involved in the care of climacteric women in the 21st century are much more able to meet the specific needs of individual patients and improve health and quality of life.",NA,"agitation Alzheimer disease/dt [Drug Therapy] amnesia/dt [Drug Therapy] anxiety arthralgia/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/si [Side Effect] breast tenderness/si [Side Effect] cardiovascular disease/dt [Drug Therapy] cardiovascular disease/pc [Prevention] *chronic disease climacterium clinical trial colorectal cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] colorectal cancer/pc [Prevention] cutaneous parameters dementia depression/dt [Drug Therapy] diabetes mellitus/dt [Drug Therapy] dysuria endometrial disease/si [Side Effect] endometrium cancer/si [Side Effect] endometrium hyperplasia/si [Side Effect] estrogen deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy] exercise female sexual dysfunction/dt [Drug Therapy] fluid retention gallbladder disease/si [Side Effect] gastrointestinal disease/si [Side Effect] headache/dt [Drug Therapy] hormone action *hormone substitution human irritability ischemic heart disease/si [Side Effect] low drug dose *menopause related disorder meta analysis mood disorder/dt [Drug Therapy] myalgia/dt [Drug Therapy] nausea/si [Side Effect] nervousness nocturia nose mucosa obesity osteolysis osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] ovary cancer/si [Side Effect] patient counseling *postmenopause *quality of life review side effect/si [Side Effect] skin irritation/si [Side Effect] stroke/si [Side Effect] urge incontinence urinary frequency urinary urgency vagina bleeding/si [Side Effect] vasomotor disorder venous thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] wellbeing acetylsalicylic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] acetylsalicylic acid/pd [Pharmacology] androgen/it [Drug Interaction] androgen/pd [Pharmacology] beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent/dt [Drug Therapy] beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent/pd [Pharmacology] calcium/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium/pd [Pharmacology] clonidine/dt [Drug Therapy] clonidine/pd [Pharmacology] diuretic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] diuretic agent/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/va [Intravaginal Drug Administration] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estriol succinate/dt [Drug Therapy] estriol succinate/va [Intravaginal Drug Administration] estriol succinate/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] estrogen/do [Drug Dose] estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] fluoxetine/dt [Drug Therapy] fluoxetine/pd [Pharmacology] folic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] folic acid/pd [Pharmacology] gestagen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] gestagen/ct [Clinical Trial] gestagen/cb [Drug Combination] gestagen/do [Drug Dose] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/ut [Intrauterine Drug Administration] gestagen/po [Oral Drug Administration] gestagen/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] medroxyprogesterone/cb [Drug Combination] medroxyprogesterone/dt [Drug Therapy] medroxyprogesterone/pd [Pharmacology] oral contraceptive agent/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] oral contraceptive agent/cb [Drug Combination] oral contraceptive agent/dt [Drug Therapy] oral contraceptive agent/pd [Pharmacology] phosphonic acid derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] phosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] phosphonic acid derivative/pd [Pharmacology] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] selective estrogen receptor modulator/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] tibolone/dt [Drug Therapy] tibolone/pd [Pharmacology] venlafaxine/dt [Drug Therapy] venlafaxine/pd [Pharmacology] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/pd [Pharmacology]","821-836","64","2004",-1

Vaishampayan","PSA relapse prostate cancer: The importance of tailored therapy","Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is an invaluable tumor marker in the detection of early prostate cancer as well as a predictor of recurrence after treatment of localized disease. Current practice entails the use of factors such as pretherapy grade, stage and PSA, PSA doubling time, nature of previous therapy and patient age and functional status for a treatment recommendation. For a PSA relapse post radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy to the prostatic fossa is a primary therapeutic consideration. With careful patient selection, about 30 to 40% of patients are rendered disease free using this approach. For patients with radiation therapy as the primary treatment for their prostate cancer, salvage prostatectomy can be considered, but is rarely feasible. Systemic therapy with hormones is standard if patients are not candidates for the above mentioned salvage local therapies or if they relapse after exhaustive local therapies. Unfortunately androgen suppressive therapy is unlikely to induce cure, or prolonged remissions in PSA relapse prostate cancer. The strategy of addition of chemotherapy or biologic therapy to androgen suppressive therapy is under active investigation. The goal of this therapy is to make an impact on the time to progression to metastatic prostate cancer and correspondingly decrease prostate cancer related mortality. Preliminary results of studies incorporating early chemotherapy in combination with androgen suppressive therapy are encouraging, with improvement in time to progression and overall survival. The evaluation of biologic agents and agents with better toxicity profiles is ongoing. This is very important to make therapy widely applicable and to enable prolonged administration especially in a disease such as prostate cancer with a relatively long natural history. Strategies of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced prostate cancer are exploring the possibility of reducing the chance of PSA relapse by treating micrometastatic disease. This review discusses the current practices in risk stratification and management of PSA relapse prostate cancer. It also highlights the major clinical trials and areas of active investigation in this field. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Gray-Owen","Engulfment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Revealing Distinct Processes of Bacterial Entry by Individual Carcinoembryonic Antigen-Related Cellular Adhesion Molecule Family Receptors","Individual Neisseria gonorrhoeae colony opacity-associated (Opa) protein variants can bind up to four different carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule (CEACAM) receptors. Most human cells encountered by gonococci express a combination of CEACAM receptors, thereby complicating the elucidation of intracellular signaling pathways triggered by individual receptors. Here, we compare the process of bacterial engulfment by a panel of stably transfected HeLa epithelial cell lines expressing each CEACAM receptor in isolation. CEACAM1 and CEACAM3 each contain proteinaceous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains; however, the processes of neisserial uptake mediated by these receptors differ with respect to their susceptibilities to both tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the actin microfilament-disrupting agent cytochalasin D. Neisserial uptake mediated by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 was not significantly affected by any of a broad spectrum of inhibitors tested. However, cleavage of the GPI anchor by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C reduced bacterial uptake by HeLa cells expressing CEACAM5, consistent with a single zipper-like mechanism of uptake mediated by this receptor. Regardless of the CEACAM receptor expressed, internalized gonococci were effectively killed by a microtubule-dependent process that required acidification of the bacterium-containing phagosome. Given the phase-variable nature of neisserial Opa proteins, these results indicate that the mechanism of bacterial engulfment and the cellular response to gonococcal infection depend on both the receptor specificities of the neisserial Opa protein variants expressed and the spectrum of CEACAM receptors present on target cells, each of which determines the combination of receptors ultimately engaged.",NA,"acidification actin filament article *bacterium adherence controlled study drug sensitivity genetic transfection HeLa cell human human cell internalization microtubule *Neisseria gonorrhoeae nonhuman phagosome priority journal protein domain protein family protein variant receptor binding signal transduction 4 amino 7 tert butyl 5 (4 chlorophenyl)pyrazolo[3,4 d]pyrimidine bacterial protein *carcinoembryonic antigen carcinoembryonic antigen related cellular adhesion molecule receptor *cell adhesion molecule concanamycin A cytochalasin D genistein gentamicin glycosylphosphatidylinositol nocodazole opacity associated protein phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate phosphodiesterase protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor pyrimidine derivative *receptor staurosporine unclassified drug","2742-2752","72","2004",-1

"2113","2112"," H. Kuhl","Mechanisms of sex steroids: Future developments","The discussion on the risks of hormone therapy supports the search for alternative drugs such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). These compounds are suitable for special preventive goals, but cannot be expected to replace the use of estrogens in patients with estrogen deficiency. The development of selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) which has to resolve various problems, might be a promising approach. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with natural estrogens remains the measure of choice for treatment of symptoms caused by estrogen deficiency. Recent findings suggest that the additional progestogen which is used for the protection of the endometrium, plays a crucial role with regard to the risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease. As surrogate parameters cannot predict the extent of risks, suitable tools for the selection of progestogens with the least potential for causing adverse effects, are urgently needed. Experimental, clinical and epidemiological data suggest that the elevation in breast cancer risk is due to the proliferative effect of estrogens on breast tissue which is largely enhanced by progestogens. A short-term in vivo-test might be helpful for the evaluation of proliferative effects of estrogen-progestogen preparations. Similarly, a strictly standardized in vivo-test for the assessment of the atherogenic potential of estrogen-progestogen preparations might help to select the preparations with the lowest risk for ischemic diseases. The available data suggest that it is probably not the androgenic but the glucocorticoid activity of a progestogen which plays a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Progestogens with glucocorticoid effects may up-regulate the thrombin receptor in the vessel wall which is involved in the development of atherosclerosis and stimulation of extrinsic coagulation. 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Researchers discussed the latest findings on the interaction between sex and environmental exposures on health. Participants concluded that a greater focus on interdisciplinary hypothesis-driven research is essential to advancing the field. To understand fully the potential effect of chronic exposures, researchers need to develop models to explore not only physiologic sex differences but also behavioral responses to low-dose and multiple chemical exposures. Future research should examine sex differences from the cell line to behaviors and should track these differences across multiple generations.

To evaluate the effectiveness of supplementing a group of early stage prostate cancer patients, with 60 mg of soy isoflavones in producing a change in hormonal and proliferative risk parameters that are implicated in prostate cancer promotion. METHODS. Seventy six eligible prostate cancer patients with a Gleason score of 6 or below, between ages 50 and 80 were admitted and supplemented with soy isoflavones or placebo for a 12 week period and changes in PSA and steroid hormones were analyzed at baseline and post intervention. RESULTS. Fifty-nine patients completed the 12-week intervention. Serum free testosterone was reduced or showed no change in 61% of subjects in the isoflavone group compared to 33% in the placebo group. Serum total PSA decreased or was unchanged in 69% of the subjects in the isoflavone treated group compared to 55% in the placebo group. However, we did not see an increase in SHBG levels. Nineteen percent of subjects receiving soy isoflavones reduced total PSA by two points or more during the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that supplementing early stage prostate cancer patients with soy isoflavones, even in a study of short duration, altered surrogate markers of proliferation such as serum PSA and free testosterone in a larger number of subjects in the isoflavone supplemented group than the group receiving placebo. The study establishes the need to explore further the effects of prolonged and consistent soy consumption, which could potentially delay onset of histologic disease in this patient population. 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"adult aged article *cancer prevention *cancer risk cancer staging cell proliferation clinical trial diet supplementation dose time effect relation evaluation health promotion histopathology hormone determination human major clinical study male priority journal *prostate cancer risk assessment scoring system testosterone blood level *isoflavone derivative/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone derivative/do [Drug Dose] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] placebo *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] sex hormone binding globulin/ec [Endogenous Compound] soybean protein *steroid hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound]","141-147","59","2004",-1

However, the role of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) on ERK1/2-mediated uPA secretion and cell motility and the involvement of p56lck and EGF receptor in these processes in breast cancer cells is not well defined. We provide here evidence that H/R induces Lck kinase activity and Lck-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor in highly invasive (MDA-MB-231) and low invasive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. H/R also stimulates MEK-1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, and H/R-induced phosphorylations were suppressed by the dominant negative form of Lck (DN Lck, K273R) as well as pharmacological inhibitors of EGF receptor and Lck indicating that EGF receptors and Lck are involved in these processes. Transfection of these cells with wild type Lck or Lck F505 (Y505F) but not with Lck F394 (Y394F) induced phosphorylations of EGF receptor followed by MEK-1 and ERK1/2, suggesting that Lck is upstream of EGF receptor and Tyr-394 of Lck is crucial for these processes. H/R also induced uPA secretion and cell motility in these cells. DN Lck and inhibitors of Lck, EGF receptor, and MEK-1 suppressed H/R-induced uPA secretion and cell motility. To our knowledge, this is the first report that p56lck in presence of H/R regulates MEK-1-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation and uPA secretion through tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor, and it further demonstrates that all of these signaling molecules ultimately control the motility of breast cancer cells.",NA,"article *cell motility enhancer region *enzyme activation *enzyme release genetic transfection human human cell hypoxia oxidation reduction reaction priority journal protein phosphorylation protein targeting reoxygenation signal transduction tumor growth damnacanthal emodin genistein *mitogen activated protein kinase *protein kinase Lck *protein p56 *protein tyrosine kinase reactive oxygen metabolite *urokinase receptor","9733-9742","279","2004",-1

The antibodies were also tested for their ability to block the binding of VVLB4 to the Tn antigen expressed on immobilized asialo ovine submaxillary mucin. Two MAbs, VV34 and VV2, specifically recognized VVLB4 and impaired the binding of the lectin to the Tn antigen by 98% and 21%, respectively. On the other hand, MAbs VV1 and VV22 cross-reacted with other purified lectins. The four antibodies recognized native and periodate-oxidized nonreduced as well as reduced VVLB4 after SDS-PAGE and Western blot, suggesting that they were recognizing continuous polypeptide epitopes. The VV34 antibody recognized two tryptic peptides (7-29 and 96-106) from VVLB4, which are contiguous in the three-dimensional structure of the lectin.

William","Dietary genistein results in larger MNU-induced, estrogen-dependent mammary tumors following ovariectomy of Sprague-Dawley rats","Due to the estrogenic properties of soy-derived isoflavones, many postmenopausal women are using these compounds as a natural alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). How isoflavones impact breast cancer in postmenopausal women is important, because a majority of breast cancer cases occur in this age group. Chemical induction of mammary tumors in female rats has been used to determine that exposure of the mammary gland to soy isoflavones prior to tumor induction is protective against tumor formation. Here we investigate the effect of dietary genistein on mammary tumors that have already formed. The study was designed to determine the action of dietary genistein in a low endogenous estrogen environment as is observed in postmenopausal women. Animals were ovariectomized (OVX) after mammary tumor development and were then placed into one of three treatment groups: positive-control (OVX+ estradiol implant), genistein (OVX+ 750 p.p.m. genistein) and negative-control (OVX alone). Tumors were distinguished as malignant or benign by histopathological examination and were further characterized as either estrogen-dependent or estrogen-independent using immunohistochemistry to identify the presence of both estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and the progesterone receptor (PR). Genistein at 750 p.p.m. increased the weight of estrogen-dependent adenocarcinomas in ovariectomized rats compared with the negative-control animals. Genistein treatment also resulted in a higher percentage of proliferative cells in tumors and increased uterine weights when compared with negative-control animals. Collectively, these effects are probably due to the estrogenic activity of genistein. Plasma genistein concentrations in animals fed the isoflavone-containing diet were at physiological levels relevant to human exposure. Estradiol concentrations in ovariectomized animals not receiving an estradiol supplement were similar to those observed in postmenopausal women. The data suggest that in an endogenous estrogen environment similar to that of a postmenopausal woman, dietary genistein can stimulate the growth of a mammary carcinogen MNU-induced estrogen-dependent mammary tumors.

To determine whether supplemental amounts of soy isoflavone (genistein-rich extract) would lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels more than 50% in patients with prostate cancer (CaP). Methods. A total of 62 men (mean age 73.6 years, range 61.4 to 89.3) with histologically proven CaP who had two consecutive elevated PSA readings were accrued during a 13-month period. An open-label pilot study was conducted for 6 months in which the patients took capsules containing the genistein-rich extract three times daily by mouth. The subjects were in one of five groups: after radical retropubic prostatectomy (n = 9), after radiotherapy (n = 17), after both radical retropubic prostatectomy and radiotherapy (n = 6), off-cycle during hormonal therapy (intermittent hormones; n = 14), or active surveillance (n = 16). The primary endpoint for the trial was a 50% reduction in the PSA level at 6 months compared with before treatment. Results. Of the 62 men enrolled, 52 were available for evaluation at 6 months. Three patients discontinued because of adverse events (diarrhea) and seven because of personal choice. One of 52 patients had a more than 50% reduction in the PSA level (1.9% response, 95% confidence interval 0.1% to 10.3%). An additional 7 patients had PSA reductions that were less than 50%. All 8 patients with lower PSA levels at 6 months were in the active surveillance (watchful waiting) treatment subgroup. Repeated measure regression models allowing for correlation between initial levels and change also indicated a decline in PSA in this group compared with other groups: 0 of 52 had a complete response, 9 (17%) had a partial response, 8 (15%) had stable disease, and 35 (67%) had disease progression. In the 9 patients with a partial response, 6 had pathologic findings that were moderately differentiated, 2 had well-differentiated findings, and 1 had poorly differentiated findings. Therefore, the response in this group of patients did not appear to be driven by the Gleason score. The total testosterone level was lowered in one of the patients responding, but it was higher in five others. Conclusions. A genistein-rich extract as the sole treatment for CaP did not reduce PSA levels by 50% or more in 51 of 52 subjects. Thus, it does not appear to be an effective treatment for CaP when given alone. However, 8 of 13 evaluated patients in the active surveillance group had either no rise or a decline in PSA levels of less than 50%.

Information on lifestyles and sera of the subjects were collected in 1988-90, and they were followed up to 1999. Incident and dead cases of prostate cancer and controls were matched for study area and age. Phytoestrogens and sex hormones in sera stored at -80degreeC were measured in 2002. Of 14,105 male subjects of the cohort who donated their sera, 52 cases and 151 controls were identified. Three datasets were analyzed; 1) all subjects, 2) 40 cases and 101 controls after excluding subjects with low testosterone levels who were suspected of having had medical intervention, and 3) 28 cases and 69 controls with prostate specific antigen level of <10.0 ng/ml.

Male ICR mice, 1 day after birth, were exposed for 5 days to genistein (1000 mug/mouse/day) or diethylstilbestrol (DES) (50 mug/mouse/day), used as an example of a potent estrogen, and their testes were used when they were 12 weeks old. Since exposure to DES was been reported to induce morphological changes and alteration of gene expression in reproductive organs, DES was used as a positive control. Genistein-treated mice did not show any histological abnormalities or increased apoptotic cells in testes, but these abnormalities and increases were found in DES-treated mice. On the other hand, mRNA expression analysis using in-house cDNA microarray revealed that 2 down-regulated genes (GeneBank accession No. W49392 and AI430907) were detected in genistein-treated mouse testes. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis revealed that mRNAs of the W49392 gene, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and androgen receptor (AR), were down-regulated in the testes of both genistein-treated and DES-treated mice. In our present study using toxicogenomic analysis, long-term alteration in testicular mRNA expression, without morphological change in testes, was detected after neonatal treatment with genistein, indicating that the W49392 gene, in addition to ERalpha and AR, might be useful as a biological marker for predicting the effects of neonatal exposure to DES and genistein. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of these proteins on the transcriptional activity of natural estrogens or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) has not been determined. Here we show that AIB1-3 causes a significant increase in the efficacy of 17beta-estradiol at both estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) and ER-beta in ovarian, breast and endometrial cancer cell lines. AIB1-3 also significantly increased the efficacy of the natural estrogen genistein at both ER-alpha and ER-beta, whereas AIB1 had no effect on either the potency or efficacy of genistein at either receptor. The estrogenic efficacy of the partial agonist tamoxifen was significantly increased in all cell lines at ER-alpha by overexpression of AIB1-3 both on transfected and endogenous estrogen responsive genes. In contrast, overexpression of AIB1 or AIB1-3 had no effect on the potency or efficacy of the SERM raloxifene. We conclude that overexpression of the AIB1-3 isoform will increase the estrogenicity of a variety of natural and pharmacologic compounds in tissues that develop hormone-dependent neoplasias and overexpression of these cofactors may be a contributing factor to the hormone-driven development of neoplasia and to antiestrogen resistance of breast cancers.",NA,"animal cell article breast cancer controlled study dose response drug efficacy drug potency endometrium cancer estrogen activity estrogen responsive element female human human cell nonhuman ovary cancer priority journal *estradiol *estrogen estrogen receptor alpha estrogen receptor beta genistein/do [Drug Dose] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] isoprotein *nucleic acid binding protein raloxifene/pd [Pharmacology] selective estrogen receptor modulator/pd [Pharmacology] *steroid receptor coactivator 3 tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","403-409","23","2004",-1

We investigated the potential of genistein to modulate androgen receptor (AR) expression and transcriptional activity in the human androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Materials and Methods: AR expression at mRNA and protein level was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot, respectively. In conditioned media PSA was measured by a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA). Binding of genistein to the AR was tested in a radioligand-binding assay and reporter gene co-transfection assay was employed to investigate AR activity. Results: Using concentrations of genistein that have been detected in sera of Asian men on regular soy-diet we found down-regulation of androgen receptor at both mRNA and protein level. The relative binding affinity to the AR was below 4% when compared to methyltrienologe (R1881) and there was no modulation of AR transcriptional activity by genistein concentrations up to 1muM. We also demonstrated inhibition of PSA secretion after genistein treatment. As the anti-estrogen ICI 164 384 abolished the inhibitory effect of genistein and ER-beta, but not ER-alpha is expressed in LNCaP cells we postulate that the mechanism of genistein action on androgen receptor is mediated through ER-beta. Conclusion: Using physiological concentrations of genistein we showed AR down-regulation by genistein in prostate cancer cells occurring via ER-beta. This likely results in a modified response to hormonal stimuli and may help to explain the low incidence of prostate cancer in the Asian population. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and Methods: The National Cancer Institute is currently sponsoring a wide range of studies of promising chemoprevention agents in a variety of informative cohorts, eg high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, positive family history of cancer, increased prostate specific antigen with negative biopsies, prostate cancer followed expectantly, prostate cancer awaiting definitive therapy and the general population. The rationale for each agent under investigation is derived from epidemiological observations, prostate cancer treatment trials, secondary analyses of large cancer prevention studies, an understanding of cancer biology and prostate carcinogenesis, and/or experimental animal models. Results: Carcinogenesis is a multistep process occurring over decades which is characterized by disruption of the normal regulatory pathways controlling cellular proliferation, programmed cell death and differentiation. Administration of agents to reverse, inhibit or slow this process of malignant transformation is known as chemoprevention. Conclusion: Chemoprevention represents a promising approach to reducing the morbidity and mortality of prostate cancer. A variety of agents are currently being studied in phase 2 clinical trials, some of which may warrant subsequent evaluation in phase 3 trials with definitive cancer end points. Two large phase 3 trials, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial, which are ongoing, are also sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.",NA,"cancer center *cancer prevention carcinogenesis *chemoprophylaxis clinical trial conference paper controlled clinical trial controlled study family history human male priority journal prostate biopsy *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] prostatectomy randomized controlled trial treatment outcome alpha tocopherol/ct [Clinical Trial] alpha tocopherol/cb [Drug Combination] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] antiandrogen/dv [Drug Development] antiestrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] antiestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] antiinflammatory agent/dv [Drug Development] antioxidant/dv [Drug Development] bicalutamide/ct [Clinical Trial] bicalutamide/dt [Drug Therapy] celecoxib/ct [Clinical Trial] celecoxib/dt [Drug Therapy] doxercalciferol/ct [Clinical Trial] doxercalciferol/dt [Drug Therapy] eflornithine/ct [Clinical Trial] eflornithine/dt [Drug Therapy] flutamide/ct [Clinical Trial] flutamide/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/dv [Drug Development] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] lycopene/ct [Clinical Trial] lycopene/dt [Drug Therapy] methylnitrosourea/dv [Drug Development] methylnitrosourea/dt [Drug Therapy] nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent/dv [Drug Development] placebo prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] selenium/ct [Clinical Trial] selenium/dt [Drug Therapy] selenomethionine/ct [Clinical Trial] selenomethionine/cb [Drug Combination] selenomethionine/dt [Drug Therapy] soybean protein/ct [Clinical Trial] soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] sulindac sulfone/ct [Clinical Trial] sulindac sulfone/dt [Drug Therapy] toremifene/dv [Drug Development] toremifene/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/dv [Drug Development] vitamin D derivative/dt [Drug Therapy]","S68-S75","171","2004",-1

We conducted a nested case-control study to examine the relationship between serum enterolactone concentration and risk of breast cancer. Enterolactone concentrations were measured by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay in serum collected at 4 independent cross-sectional population surveys from 206 women with breast cancer diagnosed during follow-up (mean 8.0 years) and from 215 controls frequency-matched to cases by study cohort, 5-year age group and study area. Mean serum enterolactone concentration (nmol/l) did not significantly differ between case and control subjects [25.2 (SD 22.2) vs. 24.0 (SD 21.3), respectively]. Odds ratios for breast cancer risk estimated by conditional logistic regression for increasing concentration of enterolactone in quartiles were 1.00 (referent), 1.67 (95% CI 0.95-2.95), 1.71 (95% CI 0.96-3.06) and 1.30 (95% CI 0.73-2.31), and p for trend was 0.48.

The objective of our present study was to identify the combined effects of dietary soy phytochemicals and tea components on breast tumor progression in a clinically relevant in vivo model of MCF-7 androgen-dependent human breast tumor in female SCID mice. MCF-7 tumor growth, tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, microvessel density, and expressions of tumor estrogen receptors were compared in mice treated with genistin-rich soy isoflavones (GSI), soy phytochemical concentrate (SPC), black tea (BT), green tea (GT), SPC/BT combination and SPC/GT combination. GSI and SPC led to dose-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 tumor growth via inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vivo. GT showed more potent anti-breast tumor activity than BT. GT infusion at 1.5 g tealeaf/100 mL water produced significant (p < 0.05) reductions of 56% in final tumor weight. GT plus SPC at 0. 1% of the diet further reduced final tumor weight by 72% (p < 0.005). Analysis of serum and tumor biomarkers showed that the combined effects of SPC and GT inhibited tumor angiogenesis, and reduced estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and serum levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. Our study suggests that dietary SPC plus GT may be used as a potential effective dietary regimen for inhibiting progression of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"angiogenesis animal experiment animal model antineoplastic activity apoptosis article blood analysis *breast carcinoma/th [Therapy] breast tumor cancer inhibition cell proliferation cell strain MCF 7 controlled study density diet *diet therapy dose response experimental model experimental mouse female hormone dependence human human cell infusion microvasculature mouse nonhuman phytochemistry priority journal protein blood level protein expression serum soybean tea tumor cell culture tumor growth biological marker black tea extract estrogen receptor alpha *genistin green tea extract *isoflavone somatomedin water","8-14","108","2004",-1

Design: The study sample consisted of 98 healthy, postmenopausal women who were randomly allocated, on a double-blind basis, to receive either 644 mg/d DT56a (study group) or 344 mg/d DT56a supplemented with calcium (low-dose group) for 12 months. Each participant was assessed with a comprehensive health questionnaire, a detailed physical, and laboratory and pelvic sonogram examinations at entry and every 3 months thereafter. BMD was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar) of the lumbar spine and femoral neck before the study began and after 12 months of treatment. Results: After 12 months of treatment, BMD had increased in the study group by 3.6% in the lumbar spine (P = 0.039) and by 2.0% in the femoral neck (NS). In the low-dose group, BMD had decreased in the lumbar spine by 0.6% (NS) and by 0.6% in the femoral neck (NS). Comparison of the change in bone density between the groups yielded a significant difference for the lumbar spine (P = 0.037). Neither group showed a change in endometrial thickness and sex hormone levels nor reported any side effects of treatment.

The use of progestogens is under discussion because of potential adverse effects on the breast. Generally after treatment for endometrial cancer, current preference should be for low-dose oestrogen monotherapy rather than continuous combined therapy with progestogen addition in view of the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease found with the latter regimen.

Female Wistar rats (4 weeks old) were either sham-operated (SH; n = 9/group) or OVX and placed on experimental diets (n = 9/group): OVX; OVX rats fed 50 ppm of CdCl2 (OVX-Cd); OVX fed 50 ppm of CdCl2 and 10 mug/kg of body weight genistein (OVX-Cd-G); and OVX fed 50 ppm of CdCl2 and 10 mug/kg of body weight estrogen (OVX-Cd-E). All rats were given free access to A1N-76 modified diet and drinking water, with or without Cd, for 8 weeks. The OVX groups gained more body weight than the SH group. Femoral weight was increased by feeding genistein and estradiol, whereas femoral length among groups was not significantly different. Femoral Cd content was significantly higher in the OVX-Cd group than in the other groups. Both serum osteocalcin and calcium (Ca) concentrations, as well as urinary Ca, were significantly higher in the OVX-Cd group than in the other groups. Urinary excretion of Cd was significantly increased in Cd-OVX-G rats, and fecal Cd excretion was increased by feeding both genistein and estradiol. Femoral histomorpological changes in proliferative cartilage and hypertrophic cells in the OVX-Cd group showed that both cell types were decreased by feeding Cd, and irregular arrangements were observed in proliferative cells. However, both cells types exhibited normal distribution in OVX-Cd-G and OVX-Cd-E groups.

Obesity increases breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women by around 30%, probably by increasing serum concentrations of bioavailable oestradiol. Moderate alcohol intakes increase breast cancer risk by about 7% per alcoholic drink per day, perhaps also by increasing oestrogen levels. Populations with high fat intakes generally have high rates of breast cancer, but studies of individual women have not confirmed an association of high fat diets with breast cancer risk. Phyto-oestrogens can affect hormone metabolism, but data on phyto-oestrogen consumption and breast cancer risk are inconsistent. Nutrition might affect breast cancer risk by altering levels of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-I.

The precipitation of menopause in premenopausal women who undergo chemotherapy for breast cancer can lead to the rapid onset of hot flash symptoms that are more frequent and more severe than those associated with natural menopause. In addition, tamoxifen, historically the most commonly prescribed pharmacologic agent for the treatment of breast cancer, is associated with hot flashes in more than 50% of its users. Although estrogen relieves hot flashes in 80-90% of women who initiate treatment, its use in women with a history of breast cancer is controversial, and most physicians in the community will not use this treatment modality.

We evaluated the relationship between isoflavone consumption and breast cancer risk among women in the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study on Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases (JPHC Study). Methods: In January 1990, 21 852 Japanese female residents (aged 40-59 years) from four public health center areas completed a self-administered questionnaire, which included items about the frequency of soy consumption. Through December 1999 and 209 354 person-years of follow-up, 179 women were diagnosed with breast cancer. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for breast cancer in relation to consumption of miso soup, soyfoods, and estimated isoflavones. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Consumption of miso soup and isoflavones, but not of soyfoods, was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer. The associations did not change substantially after adjustment for potential confounders, including reproductive history, family history, smoking, and other dietary factors. Compared with those in the lowest quartile of isoflavone intake, the adjusted RRs for breast cancer for women in the second, third, and highest quartiles were 0.76 (95% CI = 0.47 to 1.2), 0.90 (95% CI = 0.56 to 1.5), and 0.46 (95% CI = 0.25 to 0.84), respectively (Ptrend = .043). The inverse association was stronger in postmenopausal women (Ptrend = .006). Conclusion: In a population-based, prospective cohort study in Japan, frequent miso soup and isoflavone consumption was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer.",NA,"adult anamnesis article *breast cancer cancer inhibition *cancer risk cohort analysis confidence interval controlled study diet family history female follow up food intake health center human Japan postmenopause priority journal prospective study public health questionnaire regression analysis risk assessment smoking *soybean *isoflavone derivative","906-913","95","2003",-1

The molecular mechanisms that are involved in its cancer preventive properties have not been completely understood. The present study is designed to investigate the mechanism involved in the inhibitory action of genistein in MCF-7 cells. Genistein at 50 and 100 muM significantly arrested the growth of MCF-7 cells at G2/M phase (P<0.05) and decreased at the proliferative S phase (P<0.05). Using cDNA microarray technology, genes differentially regulated by genistein were identified. In particular, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), genistein up-regulated heat shock protein 105 (HSP) mRNA and down-regulated mRNA expression of serum response factor (SRF), estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, disabled homolog 2 (DOC 2) and recombination activation gene 1 (RAG-1). Using real time RT-PCR, we have shown that HSP and SRF mRNA were both regulated by genistein in a time- and dose-dependent manner; however, it appears that only the effect of genistein on SRF mRNA, but not HSP mRNA expression, can be partially abolished by cotreatment with estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780. Western blotting analysis showed that the expressions of the ERalpha and SRF protein decreased significantly with genistein treatment (P<0.05). These results suggest that the inhibitory action of genistein on human breast cancer cells appears to be complex and is only partially mediated by the alteration of estrogen receptor-dependent pathways. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Feldman","Pathways mediating the growth-inhibitory actions of vitamin D in prostate cancer","Vitamin D is emerging as an important dietary factor that affects the incidence and progression of many malignancies including prostate cancer. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3], inhibits the growth and stimulates the differentiation of prostate cancer cells. We have studied primary cultures of normal and cancer-derived prostatic epithelial cells as well as established human prostate cancer cell lines to elucidate the molecular pathways of 1,25(OH)2D3 actions. These pathways are varied and appear to be cell specific. In LNCaP cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 mainly causes growth arrest through the induction of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 and also stimulates apoptosis to a much smaller extent. We have used cDNA-microarray analyses to identify additional genes that are regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 and to raise novel therapeutic targets for use in the chemoprevention or treatment of prostate cancer. Less calcemic analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 that have more antiproliferative activity are being developed that will be more useful clinically. In target cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 induces 24-hydroxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes its self inactivation. Cotreatment with 24-hydroxylase inhibitors enhances the antiproliferative activity of 1,25(OH)2D3. The combination of other anticancer agents such as retinoids with vitamin D offers another promising therapeutic approach. A small clinical trial has shown that 1,25(OH)2D3 can slow the rate of prostate-specific antigen increase in prostate cancer patients, which demonstrates proof of the concept that vitamin D or its analogs are clinically effective.

Genistein and daidzin are examples of these phytoestrogens, which have recently been the subject of extensive research. In this study, genistein and daidzin were found to enhance the acetylcholin-esterase (AChE) activity of the rat neuronal cell line PC12 at concentrations as low as 0.08 muM by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). Results have shown that this enhancement was effectively blocked by the known estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen, indicating the involvement of the ER in AChE induction. That genistein and daidzin are estrogenic were confirmed in a cell proliferation assay using the human breast cancer cell line MCF7. This proliferation was also blocked by tamoxifen, again indicating the involvement of the ER. On the other hand, incubating the PC12 cells in increasing concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) did not lead to enhanced AChE activity, even in the presence of genistein or daidzin. This suggests that mere binding of an estrogenic compound to the ER does not necessarily lead to enhanced AChE activity. Moreover, the effect of the phytoestrogens on ACHE AChE activity cannot be expressed in the presence of E2 since they either could not compete with the natural ligand in binding to the ER or that E2 down-regulates its own receptor. This study clearly suggests that genistein and daidzin enhance AChE activity in PC12 cells by binding to the ER; however, the actual mechanism of enhancement is not known.",NA,"animal cell cell proliferation cell strain conference paper enzyme activity enzyme assay *estrogen activity hormone receptor interaction ligand binding nonhuman pheochromocytoma cell rat receptor binding receptor down regulation *acetylcholinesterase antiestrogen/cb [Drug Combination] antiestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] antiestrogen/do [Drug Dose] *daidzein/cb [Drug Combination] *daidzein/cm [Drug Comparison] *daidzein/do [Drug Dose] estradiol/cb [Drug Combination] estradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] estradiol/do [Drug Dose] *estrogen receptor *genistein/cb [Drug Combination] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/do [Drug Dose] nerve growth factor nerve growth factor receptor *phytoestrogen/cb [Drug Combination] *phytoestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] *phytoestrogen/do [Drug Dose] protein kinase C tamoxifen/cb [Drug Combination] tamoxifen/cm [Drug Comparison] tamoxifen/do [Drug Dose]","117-123","40","2003",-1

Silicone is known to be a chemically inert substance, and multiple studies have since failed to prove any adverse effects directly related to its chemical interaction with tissue. In view of the long-term experience with the application of silicone gel in breast implants since 1962, we can conclude that no better alternative material for breast implant fillers is currently available.

Erythropoietin (Epo) is a hypoxia-inducible stimulator of erythropoiesis. Acting via its receptor (EpoR), Epo up-regulates bcl-2 and inhibits apoptosis of erythroid cells and rescues neurons from hypoxic damage. In addition to human papillomavirus infection, increased bcl-2 expression and decreased apoptosis are thought to play a role in the progression of cervical neoplasia. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting we showed that HeLa and SiHa cervical carcinoma cells and human cervical carcinomas express EpoR, and that hypoxia enhances EpoR expression. Exogenous Epo stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibited the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of Epo, EpoR, p16, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, and bcl-2 in benign and dysplastic cervical squamous epithelia and invasive squamous cell carcinomas (ISCCs). EpoR expression in benign epithelia was confined to the basal cell layers, whereas in dysplasias it increasingly appeared in more superficial cell layers and showed a significant correlation with severity of dysplasia. Diffuse EpoR expression was found in all ISCCs. Expression of Epo and HIF-1alpha was increased in dysplasias compared to benign epithelia. Focal Epo and HIF-1alpha expression was seen near necrotic areas in ISCCs, and showed correlation in their spatial distribution. Significant correlation was found between expression of EpoR, and p16 and bcl-2 in benign and dysplastic squamous epithelia. Our results suggest that increased expression of Epo and EpoR may play a significant role in cervical carcinogenesis and tumor progression.

"2195","2197"," J. Slavin","Why whole grains are protective: Biological mechanisms","Epidemiological studies find that whole-grain intake is protective against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. Potential mechanisms for this protection are diverse since whole grains are rich in nutrients and phytochemicals. First, whole grains are concentrated sources of dietary fibre, resistant starch and oligosaccharides, carbohydrates that escape digestion in the small intestine and are fermented in the gut, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFA lower colonic pH, serve as an energy source for the colonocytes and may alter blood lipids. These improvements in the gut environment may provide immune protection beyond the gut. Second, whole grains are rich in antioxidants, including trace minerals and phenolic compounds, and these compounds have been linked to disease prevention. Additionally, whole grains mediate insulin and glucose responses. Although lower glycaemic load and glycaemic index have been linked to diabetes and obesity, risk of cancers such as colon and breast cancer have also been linked to high intake of readily-available carbohydrate. Finally, whole grains contain many other compounds that may protect against chronic disease. These compunds include phytate, phyto-oestrogens such as lignan, plant stanols and sterols, and vitamins and minerals. As a consequence of the traditional models of conducting nutrition studies on isolated nutrients, few studies exist on the biological effects of increased whole-grain intake. The few whole-grain feeding studies that are available show improvements in biomarkers with whole-grain consumption, such as weight loss, blood lipid improvement and antioxidant protection.",NA,"*antioxidant activity cancer prevention carbohydrate metabolism cardiovascular disease/pc [Prevention] conference paper diabetes mellitus/pc [Prevention] dietary fiber energy resource fermentation technique food intake glucose metabolism *grain immunity insulin metabolism *nutritional value obesity/pc [Prevention] phytochemistry risk management stomach pH lignan mineral phytate phytoestrogen short chain fatty acid sterol vitamin","129-134","62","2003",-1

Ginsenoside-Rh1 activated the transcription of the estrogen-responsive luciferase reporter gene in MCF-7 breast cancer cells at a concentration of 50muM. Activation was inhibited by the specific estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, indicating that the estrogenic effect of ginsenoside-Rh1 is estrogen receptor dependent. Ginsenoside-Rh1 induction of luciferase activity was dose-dependent in CV-1 cells transiently transfected with estrogen receptor and reporter plasmids. Next, we evaluated the ability of ginsenoside-Rh1 to induce the estrogen-responsive genes in MCF-7 cells. Ginsenoside-Rh1 increased c-fos and pS2 at the mRNA levels at 24h after treatment, although the effects were not as prominent as 17beta-estradiol. Western blot analysis showed that progesterone receptor protein was induced at 24h of treatment of ginsenoside-Rh1. However, ginsenoside-Rh1 failed to activate the glucocorticoid receptor, the androgen receptor, or the retinoic acid receptor in CV-1 cells transiently transfected with the corresponding steroid hormone receptors and hormone responsive reporter plasmids.

Stoica","Estradiol rapidly activates Akt via the ErbB2 signaling pathway","Previously, we have demonstrated that the two mitogenic growth factors epidermal growth factor and IGF-I can activate Akt and estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) in the hormone-dependent breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. In this report we now show that estradiol can also rapidly activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K)/Akt and that this effect is mediated by the ErbB2 signaling pathway. Treatment of cells with estradiol resulted in phosphorylation of Akt and a 9-fold increase in Akt activity in 10 min. Akt activation was blocked by wortmannin and LY 294,002, two inhibitors of PI 3-K; by genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an ER agonist; by AG825, a selective ErbB2 inhibitor; and by the antiestrogens ICI 182,780 and 4-hydroxytamoxifen; but not by rapamycin, an inhibitor of the ribosomal protein kinase p70S6K; nor by AG30, a selective epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor. Akt activation by estradiol was abrogated by an arginine-to-cysteine mutation in the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt (R25C). Growth factors also activated Akt in the ER-negative variant of MCF-7, MCF-7/ADR, but estradiol did not induce Akt activity in these cells. Transient transfection of ERalpha into these cells restored Akt activation by estradiol, suggesting that estradiol activation of Akt requires the ERalpha. Estradiol did not activate Akt in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with an anti-ErbB2-targeted ribozyme, further confirming a role for ErbB2. In vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitation and anti-Akt1, -Akt2, and -Akt3-specific antibodies demonstrated that Akt1 is activated by estradiol in MCF-7 cells whereas Akt3 is the activated isoform in ER-negative MDA-MB231 cells, implying that selective activation of Akt subtypes plays a role in the actions of estradiol. Taken together, our data suggest that estradiol, bound to membrane ERalpha, interacts with and activates an ErbB dimer containing ErbB2, inducing activation of PI 3-K/Akt.",NA,"amino acid substitution article controlled study *enzyme activation enzyme phosphorylation genetic transfection human human cell immunoprecipitation *oncogene neu priority journal signal transduction 17alpha estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone 4-hydroxytamoxifen 5 (2 benzothiazolyl)thiomethyl 4 hydroxy 3 methoxybenzylidenecyanoacetamide ag 30 arginine cysteine dexamethasone diethylstilbestrol epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor antibody *estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor alpha estrone fulvestrant genistein phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase pleckstrin promegestone *protein kinase B protein kinase inhibitor protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor rapamycin somatomedin C unclassified drug wortmannin","818-830","17","2003",-1

Cason","Morphometric evaluation of ovarian tissue exposed to PCB conventionally and in a sustained manner","Most natural estrogens are short-lived, do not accumulate in tissue and are easily broken down in the liver. In contrast to natural estrogens, estrogenic drugs such as ethynylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol, synthetic environmental estrogens such as beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and phytoestrogens, are more stable and remain in the body longer than natural estrogens. Because most of these compounds are lipophilic, they tend to accumulate within the fat and tissue of animals and humans. Thus, depending on the natural estrogen levels, environmental estrogens may have different influences (mimicking, or blocking estrogen's effects) on estrogen activities. A total of 14 adult female rats were divided randomly into three groups. Animals in group I (n=4) served as control. Animals in group II (n=5) were injected with PCBs, and animals in group III (n=5) were implanted with TCPL capsules containing PCBs. Pap smears were obtained daily, and at the end of the experimental phase the animals were sacrificed and vital organs as well as reproductive organs were obtained and wet weights were recorded. Significant reductions in ovarian wet weights were found in all animals treated with either sustained release of PCBs or injection of PCBs. Ovarian tissue was further analyzed histologically to determine the effects of PCBs. Histomorphometric data revealed significant reduction (p<0.05) in the total ovarian area of animals treated with PCBs. Measurements of cross-sectional lengths confirmed the reduction seen in the area. Overall, the data suggest that PCB pollutants have produced detrimental effects on endocrine function as well as fertility regardless of the route of administration.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue body weight conference paper controlled study *estrogen activity female *female fertility histopathology hypothalamus morphometrics nonhuman organ weight ovary follicle maturation *ovary function Papanicolaou test rat calcium phosphate estrogen follitropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] gonadorelin/ec [Endogenous Compound] luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] *polychlorinated biphenyl/to [Drug Toxicity]","434-439","39","2003",-1

Jordan","Resveratrol acts as an estrogen receptor (ER) agonist in breast cancer cells stably transfected with ERalpha","Resveratrol (Res) is a phytoestrogen found in grapes and present in red wine. Res has been shown to function as an estrogen receptor (ER) agonist, but it remains unclear whether it may also exert antagonist activity. Our aim was to study the effects of Res at both the molecular (TGFalpha gene activation) and the cellular (cell growth) levels in breast cancer cells stably transfected with wild-type (wt) ER(D351) and mutant (mut) ER (D351Y). TGFalpha mRNA induction was used as a specific marker of estradiol (E2) responsiveness. Res caused a concentration-dependent (10-8-10-4 M) stimulation of TGFalpha mRNA, indicating that it acts as an estrogen agonist in these cell lines. The pure antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI) blocked Res-induced activation of TGFalpha, consistent with action through an ER-mediated pathway. Further studies that combined treatments with E2 and Res showed that Res does not act as an antagonist in the presence of various (10-11-10-8 M) concentrations of E2. To determine whether Res can be classified as a type I or type II estrogen (Jordan et al., Cancer Res 2001;61:6619-23,), we examined Res with the D351G ER in the TGFalpha assay and found that Res belongs to the type I estrogens. Both Res and E2 had concentration-dependent growth inhibitory effects in cells expressing wtER and D351Y ER. Although the pure antiestrogen ICI blocked the growth inhibitory effects of E2, it did not block the inhibitory effects of Res, suggesting that the antiproliferative effects of Res also involve ER-independent pathways. Interestingly, Res differentially affected the levels of ER protein in these 2 cell lines: Res down-regulated wtER levels while significantly up-regulating the amount of mutD351Y ER. Cotreatment with ICI resulted in strongly reduced ER levels in both cell lines. Gene array studies revealed Res-induced upregulation of more than 80 genes, among them a profound activation of p21CIP1/WAF1 a gene associated with growth arrest. The p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels measured by Western blotting confirmed Res-induced significant up-regulation of this protein in both cell lines. In summary, Res acts as an ER agonist at low doses but also activates ER-independent pathways, some of which inhibit cell growth. 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"antineoplastic activity article *breast cancer cancer cell cancer inhibition cell growth controlled study dose response genetic transfection grape human human cell priority journal Western blotting wine acolbifene/pd [Pharmacology] diethylstilbestrol/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] *estrogen receptor alpha fulvestrant/pd [Pharmacology] gw 7604/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA protein p21 *resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] transforming growth factor alpha unclassified drug","587-596","104","2003",-1

Genistein combined polysaccharide (GCP), a genistein aglycone rich functional food supplement was used in these experiments. Tumor-bearing mice were subjected to oral administration of GCP for 28 days. GCP treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth. Induction of apoptosis by GCP treatment was related to activation of cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, induction of the p21 protein expression and reduction of cyclin B1 expression in the tumor tissues. Genistein exists as a glucuronide conjugate in normal organ tissues, and the conjugated genistein lacks the physiological activity of the aglycone. Tumor tissues contain large amounts of beta-glucuronidase, the enzyme that converts the genistein beta-glucuronide conjugate into genistein aglycone. The resulting genistein aglycone exerts its chemopreventive activities, including the induction of apoptosis in tumor tissues, and, finally, leads to tumor growth inhibition. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The search for anti-invasive treatments led us to screen compounds of different classes for their effect in an assay for invasion. Thirty-nine new compounds synthesized in the present study along with 56 already reported compounds belonging mainly to the classes of lactones, pyrazoles, isoxazoles, coumarins, desoxybenzoins, aromatic ketones, chalcones, chromans, isoflavanones have been tested against organotypic confronting cultures of invasive human MCF-7/6 mammary carcinoma cells with embryonic chick heart fragments in vitro. Three of them (a pyrazole derivative, an isoxazolylcoumarin and a prenylated desoxybenzoin) inhibited invasion at concentrations as low as 1 muM; instead of occupying and replacing the heart tissue within 8 days, the MCF-7/6 cells grew around the heart fragments and left it intact, when treated with these compounds. At the anti-invasive concentration of 1 muM, the three compounds did not affect the growth of the MCF-7/6 cells, as shown in the sulforhodamine B assay. Aggregate formation on agar was not stimulated by any of the three anti-invasive compounds, making an effect on the E-cadherin/catenin complex improbable. This is an invasion suppressor that can be activated in MCF-7/6 cells by a number of other molecules. Our data indicate that some polyphenolic and heterocyclic compounds are anti-invasive without being cytotoxic for the cancer cells. 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Genistein at 50 mumol/L completely inhibited expression of the PART-1 transcript in LNCaP cells induced by DHT at 0.1 and 1.0 nmol/L. Daidzein was less potent than genistein, whereas glycitein at the same levels as genistein or daidzein did not inhibit DHT-induced PART-1 transcript expression.

Soy proteins used to lower serum cholesterol are rich sources of phytoestrogens. Therefore, we assessed the effect of soy consumption on serum PSA in men who had participated in cholesterol lowering studies. Materials and Methods: For 3 to 4 weeks 46 healthy middle-aged men with a range of starting PSA values took soy (mean 44 gm. soy protein daily, 116 mg. isoflavones daily) or control foods, and a subgroup of men took a lower level of soy supplements for 3 months. PSA was measured at the start and end of each treatment. Results: Soy had no significant effect on serum total or free PSA, independent of PSA starting value or isoflavone intake. The lack of effect on PSA was seen, although soy intake was sufficient to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.8 + 2.2%, p = 0.012), the estimated coronary heart disease risk (6.1 + 2.8% for 10 years, p = 0.032) and the serum concentration of oxidized low-density lipoprotein measured as conjugated dienes (9.5 + 3.4%, p = 0.008) in the 3 to 4-week study. In addition, the lack of effect of soy on PSA persisted for the 3 months of the extended study.

To date, there is limited information on whether estrogenic endocrine disruptors modulate the immune system of aged individuals. To address this issue, groups of 74-week-old mice were given nine oral doses of selected estrogenic endocrine disrupters: diethylstilbestrol (DES, 3mug/100g bw), alpha-zearalanol (0.5mg/100g bw), or genistein (0.15mg/100g bw) in corn oil, or corn oil alone, over 2.5 weeks. Both developmental (thymus) and mature (spleen) lymphoid organs were affected, although specific effects varied with the chemical. DES significantly decreased thymocyte numbers. However, relative percentages of thymocyte subsets were not altered. While splenic cellularity and percentages of T and B cells were unchanged, splenocytes from DES-exposed mice had significantly decreased ability to proliferate in response to Concanavalin-A (Con-A). Con-A-activated splenocytes from mice treated with genistein or alpha-zearalanol had decreased levels of interferon- (IFN) protein in their culture supernatants compared to similar cultures from oil-treated mice. RT-PCR analysis of Con-A-activated splenocytes revealed that the expression of IFN gene is altered by DES or genistein treatment. Together, these results suggest that estrogenic endocrine disruptors modulate the immune system of aged mice. 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Soybeans contain an abundance of phytoestrogens such as genistein and daidzein, and these compounds are thought to protect against bone loss under estrogen deficient conditions. It is possible, however, that phytoestrogens other than isoflavones may suppress bone resorption. The objective of the present study was to determine whether there are any phytoestrogens other than isoflavones in soybeans that can act as antiosteoporotic agents. Methods. The isoflavones genistein and daidzein, and an extract of soybeans that contained very low levels of isoflavones were tested for their ability to reduce bone resorption in ovariectomized rats. The extract of soybeans was further analyzed for its main components by thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results. The soybean extract, as well as the two isoflavones, were effective to reduce urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline and pyridinoline, typical markers of bone resorption in ovariectomized rats. However the extract, unlike the isoflavones, increased the uterine weight of ovariectomized rats significantly. Analysis by thin-layer and gas chromatography revealed that the main constituent of this extract exhibited a chromatographic profile corresponding to coumestrol. This substance was positively identified as coumestrol by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Conclusion. These results suggest that the phytoestrogens including coumestrol and isoflavones in soybeans may exert effective prevention against bone resorption in estrogen deficient conditions.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article controlled study disease marker drug efficacy drug isolation estrogen deficiency female gas chromatography mass spectrometry nonhuman *osteolysis *osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] ovariectomy rat *soybean thin layer chromatography urinary excretion uterus weight *coumestrol/dv [Drug Development] *coumestrol/pd [Pharmacology] *daidzein/dv [Drug Development] *daidzein/ig [Intragastric Drug Administration] *daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] deoxypyridinoline *genistein/dv [Drug Development] *genistein/ig [Intragastric Drug Administration] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone derivative/dv [Drug Development] *isoflavone derivative/ih [Inhalational Drug Administration] *isoflavone derivative/ig [Intragastric Drug Administration] *isoflavone derivative/po [Oral Drug Administration] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] pyridinoline","145-152","37","2003",1

Our results have helped in determining how steroidal and nonsteriodal aromatase inhibitors bind to the active site of the enzyme. This information has also aided in the understanding of the reaction mechanism of aromatase. Furthermore, our structure-function studies of aromatase have generated important information for predicting how environmental chemicals interact with the enzyme. During the last 2 years, a new aromatase computer model based on the X-ray structure of rabbit cytochrome P450 2C5 has been generated and used to evaluate the results obtained from new aromatase mutants produced in this laboratory. In addition, we have succeeded in the expression and purification of functionally active aromatase using an Escherichia coli expression method. The catalytic properties of this recombinant aromatase are similar to those properties exhibited by the human placental aromatase preparation and the mammalian cell-expressed enzyme. The E. coli expressed aromatase will be very useful for further structure-function studies of aromatase. Our laboratory has also evaluated the growth-inhibiting activity of aromatase inhibitors in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer using three-dimensional cell cultures of aromatase-over expressing MCF-7 and T-47D cell lines (i.e. MCF-7aro and T-47Daro). Our results demonstrate that these three-dimensional cultures are valuable approaches to assess the growth-inhibiting activity of aromatase inhibitors. Finally, we have identified several phytochemicals to be potent inhibitors of aromatase. To demonstrate the impact of the phytochemicals on estrogen formation in vivo, we showed that the intake of anti-aromatase chemicals from red wine was capable of suppressing MCF-7aro-mediated tumor formation in nude mice and aromatase-induced hyperplasia in a transgenic mouse model in which aromatase is over-expressed in the mammary tissue. 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, modulation of Brca1 and Brca2 expression by different phytoestrogen-rich diets has been investigated in ovariectomized Wistar rats. Two hundred mammary glands were harvested in three independent experiments. Brca1 and Brca2 mRNAs were quantified by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and their proteins by immunohistochemistry. The first experiment compared the influence of different phytoestrogens [flax-seed, isoflavones (IFs), or rutin]. A 10% increase in Brca1 mRNA expression was shown after flax-seed consumption, whereas no variation was noted for Brca2 mRNA, nor for Brca1 and Brca2 proteins. In the second experiment, two soy IFs sources (Novasoy or Soylife) were given at different concentrations to the animals. Only Brca2 mRNA was increased and only at high doses. Finally, the effect of IFs was compared with that of estradiol. An increase in mRNA for both genes was noted after estradiol treatment and with the highest dose of IFs. In conclusion, our results show that IFs, given in the diet at different doses, are able to increase Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA in ovariectomized female Wistar rat.

Nonbiotinylated glycosylated IGFBP-3 competed for binding to each of these sites. The 32-kDa band approximated the size of intact non-glycosylated IGFBP-3, but its abundance was enhanced by cross-linking, and it had a more acidic isoelectric point on isoelectric focusing, suggesting that it had undergone phosphorylation. Immobilized IGFBP-3 was phosphorylated in the presence of 32P-ATP by both T-47D cell membranes and by intact cells treated with phenylarsine oxide to inhibit internalization. MCF-7 and COS-1 cells were also able to bind and phosphorylated IGFBP-3. IGF-I inhibited both IGFBP-3 binding to membranes and phosphorylation. However, incubation of T-47D cells with IGFBP-3 enhanced binding of 125I-IGF-I to the cell monolayer indicating that membrane bound IGFBP-3 was able to bind IGF-I. Immobilized IGFBP-3 when phosphorylated by T-47D membranes bound significantly more 125I-IGF-I than nonphosphorylated IGFBP-3. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase significantly reduced 125I-IGF-I binding to phosphorylated immobilized IGFBP-3 and also reduced 125I-IGF-I to T-47D cell monolayers preincubated with IGFBP-3. Phosphorylation of IGFBP-3 by T-47D membranes was partially blocked by inhibitors of both protein kinase A and C. These data demonstrate that binding of IGFBP-3 to breast cancer membranes is accompanied by phosphorylation at the plasma membrane and that both processes are inhibited by IGF-I. However, once phosphorylated the ability of IGFBP-3 to bind IGF-I is enhanced, resulting in increased association of the IGF-I with the cell membrane.",NA,"acidity article binding affinity binding competition biotinylation *breast cancer *cancer cell *cell membrane cell strain COS1 cell strain MCF 7 controlled study cross linking drug binding site human human cell inhibition kinetics internalization isoelectric focusing isoelectric point membrane binding monolayer culture priority journal protein binding protein immobilization protein phosphorylation 1 (5 isoquinolinesulfonyl) 2 methylpiperazine/pd [Pharmacology] 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone/pd [Pharmacology] adenosine triphosphate alkaline phosphatase arsenosobenzene cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] gamma adenosine triphosphate genistein/pd [Pharmacology] iodine 125 n [2 (4 bromocinnamylamino)ethyl] 5 isoquinolinesulfonamide/pd [Pharmacology] phosphorus 32 protein kinase C inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] *somatomedin binding protein 3 *somatomedin C unclassified drug","4042-4050","144","2003",-1

Experimental Design: A two-step intervention was implemented. During step 1 patients were begun on a low-fat diet with a goal to reduce fat intake to 15% of total daily calories. On PSA progression, a soy protein supplement was added to the diet (step 2). The primary end point was PSA reduction by 50%. Secondary end points were PSA doubling time and time to progression (TTP). Serum was analyzed for changes in the sex hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) axes. Results: Among 18 evaluable patients, (median follow-up on study 10.5 months), no patient on either step had a PSA reduction by 50% at any time. There was a trend toward a longer PSA doubling time (P = 0.06) and a prolongation in estimated median TTP of ~3 months (P = 0.018) during step 2 compared with step 1 of the study. During step 1, free testosterone levels decreased by 5 % (P < 0.01), and during step 2, IGF-I levels increased by 22% (P = 0.02). Conclusions: A low-fat diet with the subsequent addition of a soy supplement did not result in a significant decline in PSA levels. The addition of soy protein had a modest effect on TTP.

Glycosylation of some of the extracellular membrane proteins and lipids maintains the cell/cell and cell/matrix interactions. Chemical alterations in glycosylation play an important role in the metastatic behavior of tumor cells. Carbohydrate residues of the membrane glycoproteins can be detected using lectins due to their binding specificity to carbohydrates. Lectins, therefore have gained an importance in the field of cancer research. Galectins, a specialized group of lectin like proteins that are Ca+ independent and galactoside binding, are also considered as differentiation marker's in some specific cancers like the carcinomas of thyroid.

Studies from our laboratory and others have shown that genistein can induce apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related genes in breast cancer cells. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein induces apoptotic cell death is not clear. In order to investigate such mechanism, we tested the role of Akt and NF-B in genistein-treated MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We found that inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis by genistein are partly mediated through the downregulation of Akt and NF-B pathways. Gel shift assay showed that NF-B DNA-binding activity in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with Akt cDNA was induced, suggesting that there is a cross-talk between NF-B and Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, we found that genistein could abrogate EGF and Akt induced NF-B activation. From these results, we conclude that the inactivation of NF-B by genistein in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells is partly mediated via Akt pathway, which could be useful for rational design of strategies for the prevention and/or treatment of breast cancer.",NA,"antineoplastic activity apoptosis article *breast cancer cancer cell cancer inhibition cell growth controlled study down regulation drug design drug mechanism drug targeting genetic transfection growth inhibition human human cell molecular interaction priority journal protein DNA binding *signal transduction 2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone complementary DNA DNA epidermal growth factor *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *protein kinase B/ec [Endogenous Compound]","4702-4709","22","2003",-1

Asian populations consuming large amounts of Brassica have a lower breast cancer incidence compared with Western populations; however, the association between Brassica consumption and breast cancer risk is uncertain. It is difficult to estimate glucosinolate exposure and degradation in humans, possibly limiting epidemiological investigations of Brassica and cancer associations. We conducted a case control investigation of breast cancer in Shanghai, China, using urinary ITC levels as a biological measure of glucosinolate intake and degradation in populations with habitual Brassica intake. A representative subgroup of 337 cases providing presurgery, fasting, and first-morning urine specimens was one-to-one matched (age, menopausal status, date of urine collection, and day of laboratory assay) to population controls. Urinary ITC levels were inversely associated with breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) Quartile 1 = 1 (ref); ORQ2 = 0.9, 95% confidence interval (0.6, 1.4); ORQ3 = 0.7, (0.5, 1.1); ORQ4 = 0.5, (0.3, 0.8), adjusted for age, menopausal status, soy protein, fibroadenoma history, family breast cancer, physical activity, waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index, age at menarche, and parity in conditional logistic model].

"2273","2280"," S. Hough, M. P. Mahlati","Diagnosis and management of osteoporosis-full guideline","Objective. This Guideline aims to improve the efficacy of both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for osteoporosis. All health care workers are targeted in the Guideline. A rather detailed summary, which is cross-referenced to the full guideline, is provided to cater for the busy general practitioner. The motivation for the development of this Guideline is based on the facts that: Osteoporosis is a common, costly disease which carries a significant morbidity and mortality, yet is still too often regarded as an inescapable part of normal ageing. Early detection and intervention will be more cost-effective than the treatment of advanced disease. Much confusion exists regarding diagnostic criteria, the assessment of fracture risk, and therapeutic intervention thresholds. A rational approach to drug selection is seldom considered. No consensus guideline on the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis has been published in this country. Outcomes. Prevention of fracture and a reduction in morbidity and mortality were the major considerations in the development of this Guideline. Although no formal economic analysis was undertaken, the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions was considered in all recommendations. Evidence. A combination of descriptive, boundary (minimum standards) and algorithmic guidelines was employed. The highest level of evidence (meta-analyses, randomised and controlled studies) was used as far as possible and isolated descriptive studies and expert opinions were largely ignored. A draft guideline was developed, debated at a consensus meeting and finalised on the basis of written comments following the distribution of a second draft. Methodology. See Annexure B. Recommendations. In the absence of a sound health economic justification for a screening policy, it is recommended that the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is best managed using a case-finding approach. It is recommended that clinical risk factors - related to bone mineral density (BMD), bone strength or falls - provide indications for further assessment, in particular bone mass measurement. Axial, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the preferred technique to assess BMD, to diagnose osteoporosis and to assess rates of bone loss/gain. While the four diagnostic categories proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO, 1994) provide a practical basis to identify those at risk of fracture, cognisance should be taken of its limitations. We recommend that the BMD of both spine and hip should be measured, that the NHANES III reference data for Caucasians be used for subjects of all races (until local reference ranges for different ethnic groups are established), and that the same absolute thresholds be employed to diagnose osteoporosis in men and women. Recommendations are also made regarding indications for bone mass measurement and selected routine laboratory tests. The differences between diagnostic criteria and intervention thresholds are emphasised. The need to treat should not depend on a BMD value alone, but should also be determined by the patient's age, general health and willingness to consider treatment; the presence of clinical risk factors; prevalent vertebral fractures; and the rate of bone loss/turnover; as well as the cost-effectiveness and side-effects of available treatment. Non-pharmacological measures to improve bone strength include a balanced diet, physical exercise, limiting alcohol consumption, the avoidance of smoking and bone toxic drugs and the prevention of falls. No ideal drug can be recommended for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in all patients. The choice of drug is largely determined by the nature of the disease (e.g. anti-resorptive agents like calcium (+ vitamin D) for mild osteopenia, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or bisphosphonates for moderate bone loss and the addition of a bone formation-stimulating agent in patients with more severe osteoporosis) and the patient profile (e.g. bisphosphonates in otherwise healthy patients requiring a bone-spec fic drug, HRT in those with menopausal symptoms/ at risk of coronary heart disease, selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) for those at risk of breast cancer, the addition of an anabolic steroid/calcitonin in the frail elderly or in those with an acute vertebral fracture). An add-on regimen is recommended where treatment is initiated with one or two drugs and further agents are added only if the response is not satisfactory. Regular clinical, densitometric and X-ray monitoring is essential.",NA,"age article bone atrophy/dt [Drug Therapy] bone density bone mass bone mineral/ec [Endogenous Compound] bone strength bone turnover breast cancer case finding Caucasian controlled study cost effectiveness analysis densitometry diet dual energy X ray absorptiometry ethnic group exercise falling female fracture/co [Complication] fracture/pc [Prevention] gender health status hip hormone substitution human ischemic heart disease laboratory test male measurement menopause methodology osteopenia/dt [Drug Therapy] *osteoporosis/di [Diagnosis] *osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] *osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] *osteoporosis/th [Therapy] patient monitoring postmenopause osteoporosis/di [Diagnosis] postmenopause osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] postmenopause osteoporosis/pc [Prevention] postmenopause osteoporosis/th [Therapy] practice guideline risk factor smoking cessation spine vertebra fracture anabolic agent bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] calcitonin/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium/cb [Drug Combination] calcium/dt [Drug Therapy] fluoride/dt [Drug Therapy] hormone phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] salcatonin/dt [Drug Therapy] salcatonin/sc [Subcutaneous Drug Administration] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] testosterone/dt [Drug Therapy] tibolone/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/cb [Drug Combination] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy]","907-944","90","2000",-1
"2275","2281"," I. L. P. Beales","Effect of interlukin-1beta on proliferation of gastric epithelial cells in culture","Background: Helicobacter pylori is the main risk factor for the development of non-cardia gastric cancer. Increased proliferation of the gastric mucosa is a feature of H. pylori infection. Mucosal interkeukin-1beta production is increased in H. pylori infection and IL-1beta genotypes associated with increased pro-inflammatory activity are risk factors for the development of gastric cancer. The effect of IL-1beta on gastric epithelial cell proliferation has been examined in this study. Methods: AGS cells were cultured with IL-1beta. DNA synthesis was assed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and total viable cell numbers by MTT assay. Results: IL-1beta dose dependently increased DNA synthesis and cell numbers. The enhanced proliferation was blocked by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Addition of neutralising antibody to GM-CSF reduced IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation by 31 + 4 %. GM-CSF alone significantly stimulated proliferation. Addition or neutralisation of IL-8 had no effect on basal or IL-1beta-stimulated proliferation. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein completely blocked IL-1beta -stimulated proliferation and inhibition of the extracellular signal related kinase pathway with PD 98059 inhibited IL-1beta stimulated proliferation by 58 + 5 %. Conclusions: IL-1beta stimulates proliferation in gastric epithelial cells. Autocrine stimulation by GMCSF contributes to this proliferative response. Signalling via tyrosine kinase activity is essential to the mitogenic response to IL-1beta. The extracellular signal related kinase pathway is involved in, but not essential to downstream signalling. IL-1beta may contribute to the hyperproliferation seen in H. pylori- infected gastric mucosa, and be involved in the carcinogenic process. 2002 Beales; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",NA,"article autocrine effect cell count cell culture cell proliferation cell stimulation cell viability controlled study DNA synthesis downstream processing enzyme activity genotype Helicobacter pylori human human cell mitogenesis risk factor signal transduction *stomach cancer/et [Etiology] stomach carcinogenesis *stomach epithelium stomach mucosa 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone DNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent interleukin 8/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] neutralizing antibody/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor *recombinant interleukin 1beta thymidine/ec [Endogenous Compound]",NA,"2","2002",-1

Squadrito","Effects of genistein and hormone-replacement therapy on bone loss in early postmenopausal women: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study","The natural isoflavone phytoestrogen genistein has been shown to stimulate osteoblastic bone formation, inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, and prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats. However, no controlled clinical trial has been performed so far to evaluate the effects of the phytoestrogen on bone loss in postmenopausal women. We performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study to evaluate and compare with hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) the effect of the phytoestrogen genistein on bone metabolism and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. Participants were 90 healthy ambulatory women who were 47-57 years of age, with a BMD at the femoral neck of >0.795 g/cm2. After a 4-week stabilization on a standard fat-reduced diet, participants of the study were randomly assigned to receive continuous HRT for 1 year (n = 30; 1 mg of 17beta-estradiol [E2] combined with 0.5 mg of norethisterone acetate), the phytoestrogen genistein (n = 30; 54 mg/day), or placebo (n = 30). Urinary excretion of pyridinoline (PYR) and deoxypyridinoline (DPYR) was not significantly modified by placebo administration either at 6 months or at 12 months. Genistein treatment significantly reduced the excretion of pyridinium cross-links at 6 months (PYR = -54 + 10%; DPYR = -55 + 13%;p < 0.001) and 12 months (PYR = -42 + 12%; DPYR = -44 + 16%; p < 0.001). A similar and not statistically different decrease in excretion of pyridinium cross-links was also observed in the postmenopausal women randomized to receive HRT. Placebo administration did not change the serum levels of the bone-specific ALP (B-ALP) and osteocalcin (bone Gla protein [BGP]). In contrast, administration of genistein markedly increased serum B-ALP and BGP either at 6 months (B-ALP = 23 + 4%; BGP = 29 + 11%; p < 0.005) or at 12 months (B-ALP = 25 + 7%; BGP = 37 + 16%;p < 0.05). Postmenopausal women treated with HRT had, in contrast, decreased serum B-ALP and BGP levels either at 6 months (B-ALP = -17 + 6%; BGP = -20 + 9%; p < 0.001) or 12 months (B-ALP = -20 + 5%; BGP = -22 + 10%; p < 0.001). Furthermore, at the end of the experimental period, genistein and HRT significantly increased BMD in the femur (femoral neck: genistein = 3.6 + 3%, HRT = 2.4 + 2%, placebo = -0.65 + 0.1%, and p < 0.001) and lumbar spine (genistein = 3 + 2%, HRT = 3.8 + 2.7%, placebo = -1.6 + 0.3%, and p < 0.001).

The role of hormone replacement therapy in women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer","Objective: To provide information and recommendations to women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer and their physicians regarding hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Outcomes: Control of menopausal symptoms, quality of life, prevention of osteoporosis, prevention of cardiovascular disease, risk of recurrence of breast cancer, risk of death from breast cancer. Evidence: Systematic review of English-language literature published from January 1990 to July 2001 retrieved from MEDLINE and CANCERLIT. Recommendations: Routine use of HRT (either estrogen alone or estrogen plus progesterone) is not recommended for women who have had breast cancer. Randomized controlled trials are required to guide recommendations for this group of women. Women who have had breast cancer are at risk of recurrence and contralateral breast cancer. The potential effect of HRT on these outcomes in women with breast cancer has not been determined in methodologically sound studies. However, in animal and in vitro studies, the development and growth of breast cancer is known to be estrogen dependent. Given the demonstrated increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT in women without a diagnosis of breast cancer, it is possible that the risk of recurrence and contralateral breast cancer associated with HRT in women with breast cancer could be of a similar magnitude. Postmenopausal women with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer who request HRT should be encouraged to consider alternatives to HRT. If menopausal symptoms are particularly troublesome and do not respond to alternative approaches, a well-informed woman may choose to use HRT to control these symptoms after discussing the risks with her physician. In these circumstances, both the dose and the duration of treatment should be minimized.

Irth","Analytical tools for the detection and characterization of biologically active compounds from nature","Nature has been recognized as a rich source of medicinal compounds for hundreds to thousands of years. Today, a vast range of drugs, which represent the cornerstones of modern pharmaceutical care, are either natural products or have been derived from them. Though providing high chemical diversity, the implementation of natural product research in modern High Throughput Screening (HTS) programs has decreased considerably during the last decade. Instead, seemingly more cost-effective and HTS compatible approaches such as combinatorial chemistry have been explored in an effort to increase the number and diversity of chemical entities. However, pharmaceutical companies are facing enormous challenges as advances in human genome description have led to an increasing number of new molecular drug targets and intensified the need for new, additional molecular diversity as a source of novel drug molecules. Natural products still offer an attractive route to alternative chemical diversities and possess a proven track record in pharmaceutical medications. Consequently, a high demand exists for novel and highly efficient screening technologies, which enable successful incorporation of natural products in drug discovery programs. Over recent years several techniques have been developed, which interfaced continuous-flow biochemical detection with a range of analytical instruments, such as LC, DAD, UV and MS. The combination of analytical technologies and continuous-flow biochemical detection has enabled biological and chemical evaluation of bioactive molecules within a single analysis and profoundly reduces the time required for compound characterization. Recent advances in this field as well as the application of continuous-flow biochemical detection for the screening of complex mixtures, such as natural product extracts, are reviewed in this paper. 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",NA,"biological activity breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] combinatorial chemistry conference paper drug industry drug inhibition drug research drug screening drug structure drug targeting flow injection analysis high throughput screening human human genome liquid chromatography mass spectrometry medicinal plant osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] priority journal prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] aspartic proteinase inhibitor/an [Drug Analysis] biotin cathepsin D/ec [Endogenous Compound] Chinese drug/dv [Drug Development] Chinese drug/pd [Pharmacology] coumestrol estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] kaempferol *natural product/an [Drug Analysis] *natural product/dv [Drug Development] *natural product/pd [Pharmacology] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] plant extract/dv [Drug Development] plant extract/pd [Pharmacology] quercetin resveratrol/pd [Pharmacology] streptavidin vegetable oil/pd [Pharmacology] zeranol/pd [Pharmacology]","427-439","1","2002",-1

On the other hand, the fact that a given plant has become a traded item is an important lead in the effort to investigate plants for the purpose of discovering novel secondary metabolites that may have marketable properties. This report is largely based on the investigations of plants collected from vendors of medicinal plants. The identification is based on botanical specimens derived from the purchased plant parts either by growing them in a garden or through micropropagation using tissue culture techniques. Bulbine species yielded novel phenyl anthraquinones and isofuranonaphthoquinones, which were found to exhibit antiparasitic and antioxidant properties. Scilla nervosa subsp. rigidifolia and Ledebouria graminifolia yielded twenty homoisoflavonoids and two xanthones. Bulbs derived from tissue culture based specimens of L. graminifolia contained all the compounds isolated from the marketed samples. Some of the homoisoflavonoids were found to possess activity against colon and breast cancer cell lines. Rhus pyroides furnished six novel bichalcones some of which exhibited insect antifeedant, cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities. Structures of the compounds described in this report were elucidated by spectroscopic means including HRMS and ID-, and 2D-NMR experiments. Interconversion of some of the phenyl anthraquinones was accomplished as part of their structure proof. The total synthesis of three of the biflavonoids was achieved using a synthetic route which involves a microwave irradiation promoted Ulmann synthesis. 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",NA,"antimalarial activity antimicrobial activity antineoplastic activity antioxidant activity bacterial infection/dt [Drug Therapy] breast carcinoma cancer cell culture colon carcinoma conference paper cytotoxicity drug activity drug identification drug isolation drug structure drug synthesis female infertility/dt [Drug Therapy] heart disease/dt [Drug Therapy] human mycosis/dt [Drug Therapy] priority journal sexually transmitted disease/dt [Drug Therapy] skin irritation/dt [Drug Therapy] structure activity relation wound/dt [Drug Therapy] 2' o methylknipholone/an [Drug Analysis] 2' o methylknipholone/dv [Drug Development] 4' o demethylknipholone 4' o beta dextro glucopyranoside/an [Drug Analysis] 4' o demethylknipholone 4' o beta dextro glucopyranoside/dv [Drug Development] 4' o demethylknipolone/an [Drug Analysis] 4' o demethylknipolone/dv [Drug Development] amentoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] anthraquinone derivative/an [Drug Analysis] anthraquinone derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] anthraquinone derivative/dv [Drug Development] anthraquinone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] biflavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] *Bulbine extract/an [Drug Analysis] *Bulbine extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *Bulbine extract/dv [Drug Development] *Bulbine extract/dt [Drug Therapy] *Bulbine extract/pd [Pharmacology] bulbine knipolone/an [Drug Analysis] bulbine knipolone/dv [Drug Development] chloroquine/cm [Drug Comparison] chloroquine/pd [Pharmacology] foliosone/an [Drug Analysis] foliosone/dv [Drug Development] gaboroquinone a/an [Drug Analysis] gaboroquinone a/dv [Drug Development] gaboroquinone b/an [Drug Analysis] gaboroquinone b/dv [Drug Development] hinokiflavone/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavonoid/dv [Drug Development] isoflavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] isofuranonapthoquinone derivative/dv [Drug Development] isofuranonapthoquinone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] isoknipholone/an [Drug Analysis] isoknipholone/dv [Drug Development] knipholone/an [Drug Analysis] knipholone/dv [Drug Development] *Ledebouria extract/dt [Drug Therapy] *Ledebouria extract/pd [Pharmacology] phneylanthraquinone derivative/an [Drug Analysis] phneylanthraquinone derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] phneylanthraquinone derivative/dv [Drug Development] phneylanthraquinone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] *plant extract/an [Drug Analysis] *plant extract/cm [Drug Comparison] *plant extract/dv [Drug Development] *plant extract/dt [Drug Therapy] *plant extract/pd [Pharmacology] *Rhus extract/pd [Pharmacology] *squill/dv [Drug Development] *squill/dt [Drug Therapy] *squill/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","299-310","1","2002",-1

Few studies examined the effects of usual dietary isoflavone intake on bone density, and none examined the effects on markers of bone turnover. This cross-sectional study examines the association of usual, unsupplemented dietary soy intake with bone density at the lumbar spine and hip and markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women. Participants were 208 postmenopausal Southern California women aged 45-74 years. Information on behavioral and lifestyle factors was obtained, and dietary intake of isoflavones over the past year was assessed with a standardized questionnaire. Bone density was measured at the spine and hip with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Urinary type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptides (N-Tx) and pyridinium crosslinks (PYR), both markers of bone resorption, and bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), a marker of bone formation, were assayed. After adjustment for age and obesity, women with the highest daily intake of dietary genistein had N-Tx concentrations 18% lower than those of women who reported no daily genistein consumption (mean 37.29 vs. 45.44, respectively, p = 0.01). After adjustment for all covariates, there were trends toward significant differences in N-Tx (p = 0.09) and spine bone density (p = 0.07), whereby women with the highest level of isoflavone consumption had greater bone density at the spine. These results suggest that usual, unsupplemented dietary isoflavone consumption may be protective against bone loss in postmenopausal women through a reduction in bone resorption.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect and mechanisms of action of AS2O3 in human tumor cell lines. As2O3 caused inhibition of cell growth (IC50 range, 3-14 muM) in a variety of human solid tumor cell lines, including four human non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines (H460, H322, H520, H661), two ovarian cancer cell lines (SK-OV-03, A2780), cervical cancer HeLa, and breast carcinoma MCF-7, as assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Flow cytometry analysis showed that As2O3 treatment resulted in a time-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase. We observed, using Wright-Giemsa and 4',6-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride staining, that As2O3 blocked the cell cycle in mitosis. In vitro examination revealed that As2O3 markedly promoted tubulin polymerization without affecting GTP binding to beta-tubulin. Immunocytochemical and EM studies of treated MCF-7 cells showed that As2O3 treatment caused changes in the cellular microtubule network and formation of polymerized microtubules. Similar to most anti-tubulin agents, As2O3 treatment induced up-regulation of the cyclin B1 levels and activation of p34cdc2/cyclinB1 kinase, as well as Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 and -7 and cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase and beta-catenin occurred only in As2O3-induced mitotic cells, not in interphase cells, suggesting that As2O3-induced mitotic arrest may be a requirement for the activation of apoptotic pathways. In addition, As2O3 exhibited similar inhibitory effects against parental MCF-7, P-glycoprotein-overexpressing MCF-7/doxorubicin cells, and multidrug resistance protein (MRP)-expressing MCF-7/etoposide cells (resistance indices, 2.3 and 1.9, respectively). Similarly, As2O3 had similar inhibitory effect against parental ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells and tubulin mutation paclitaxel-resistant cell lines PTx10 and PTx22 (resistance indices, 0.86 and 0.93, respectively), suggesting that its effect on tubulin polymerization and G2/M phase arrest is distinct from that of paclitaxel. Taken together, our data demonstrate that As2O3 has a paclitaxel-like effect, markedly promotes tubulin polymerization, arrests cell cycle at mitosis, and induces apoptosis. In addition, As2O3 is a poor substrate for transport by P-glycoprotein and MRP, and non-cross-resistant with paclitaxel resistant cell lines due to tubulin mutation, suggesting that As2O3 may be useful for treatment of human solid tumors, particularly in patients with paclitaxel resistance.",NA,"article breast carcinoma cell cycle G2 phase cell strain MCF 7 controlled study cytotoxicity drug mechanism enzyme activation human human cell leukemia cell lung non small cell cancer *microtubule microtubule assembly *mitosis inhibition ovary cancer *polymerization priority journal promyelocytic leukemia protein phosphorylation tumor cell culture uterine cervix cancer 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone 3 (4,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide *arsenic trioxide/pd [Pharmacology] beta catenin caspase 3 caspase 7 colchicine curacin A cyclin B1 doxorubicin etoposide genistein glycoprotein P nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase nocodazole paclitaxel/pd [Pharmacology] phosphotransferase podophyllotoxin protein bcl 2 steganacin unclassified drug Vinca alkaloid","529-538","62","2002",-1

Small","Complementary and alternative therapies in prostate cancer","Complementary and alternative therapies are used with increasing frequency in men with prostate cancer. However, little is known about the efficacy of such therapies for this cancer. While epidemiological data support the association between intake of certain micronutrients with development of prostate cancer, there exist limited prospective data that support the chemopreventative or therapeutic value of such nutritional agents in prostate cancer. To date, one of the most studied treatments has been PC-SPES, a combination of eight herbal therapies with activity against prostate cancer. Studies in cell lines of human prostate cancer demonstrate significant dose-dependent decreases in cellular viability after exposure to extracts of this agent. Clinical studies suggested that PC-SPES could reduce prostate specific antigen levels in patients with either androgen-dependent or androgen-independent prostate cancer. Toxicity was mild, although there was a low risk of thromboembolic events with such treatment. Manufacture of PC-SPES was recently halted, after revelations that the herbal combination was contaminated with warfarin, which led to a recall by the manufacturer. Subsequent analyses also revealed the presence of diethylstilbestrol (DES) and indomethicin in some lots of PC-SPES. Available data regarding other alternative therapies are reviewed as well.

This study determined the effect of flaxseed (FS), the richest source of lignans and alpha-linolenic acid, on growth and metastasis of established human breast cancer in a nude mice model. Estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-435, were injected into the mammary fat pad of mice (Ncr nu/nu) fed a basal diet (BD). At Week 8, mice were randomized into two diet groups, such that the groups had similar tumor size and body weight. One continued on the BD, while the other was changed to BD supplemented with 10% FS, until sacrifice at Week 15. A significant reduction (P < 0.05) in tumor growth rate and a 45% reduction (P = 0.08) in total incidence of metastasis were observed in the FS group. Lung metastasis incidence was 55.6% in the BD group and 22.2% in the FS group, while the lymph node metastasis incidence was 88.9% in the BD group and 33.3% in the FS group (P < 0.05). Mean tumor number (tumor load) of total and lymph node metastasis was significantly lower in the FS than in the BD group (P < 0.05). Metastatic lung tumor number was reduced by 82%, and a significantly lower tumor trend (P < 0.01) was observed in the FS group. Lung weight, which also reflects metastatic tumor load, in the FS group was reduced by 20% (P < 0.05) compared with the BD group. Immunohistochemical study showed that Ki-67 labeling index and expression of insulin-like growth factor I and epithelial growth factor receptor in the primary tumor were lower in the FS (P < 0.05) than in the BD group. In conclusion, flaxseed inhibited the established human breast cancer growth and metastasis in a nude mice model, and this effect is partly due to its downregulation of insulin-like growth factor I and epidermal growth factor receptor expression.",NA,"animal experiment animal model antineoplastic activity article body weight *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer incidence *cancer inhibition controlled study *dietary intake down regulation female growth rate immunohistochemistry labeling index *linseed lung metastasis lung weight *metastasis inhibition mouse nonhuman nude mouse protein expression randomization tumor volume *epidermal growth factor receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] Ki 67 antigen lignan linoleic acid *linseed oil/dt [Drug Therapy] omega 3 fatty acid phytoestrogen *somatomedin/ec [Endogenous Compound]","187-192","43","2002",-1

Day-old Ross x Ross chicks were fed a maize-soyabean meal-based diet supplemented with four levels of L-Arg (0, 5, 10 or 20 g/kg), factorially arranged with four levels of supplemental DL-Met (0, 1, 2 or 3 g/kg). Three replicate pens of ten chicks each were randomly assigned to each treatment and fed for 14 d. An increase in Arg in the diet caused growth and feed-intake depression (P=0.0001), but increasing Met in the diet enhanced growth and feed intake (P=0.0001). Arg toxicity was dependent on the Met level of the diet (Arg x Met interaction; P=0.0153). Experiment 2 was conducted to study interrelationships among Arg, Met, and Lys. Eight treatments were factorially combined: Two levels of supplemental L-Arg (0 or 10 g/kg), two levels of supplemental DL-Met (0 or 2 g/kg), and two levels of supplemental L-Lys (0 or 6 g/kg). Six replicate pens of eight chicks per treatment were used. A three-way interaction among Arg, Met, and Lys was observed for body-weight gain and feed intake (P<0.023). As expected, kidney arginase activity increased as dietary Lys increased (P=0.0004). No interactions were found for kidney arginase activity. Muscle creatine increased when chicks were fed the higher Arg (25.2 g/kg) diet (P=0.0047). A three-way interaction among Arg. Met, and Lys was found for muscle creatine (P=0.0075). Excess dietary Lys depressed muscle creatinine concentration, but only in the presence of the lower concentrations of Arg and Met. To conclude, an interrelationship among Arg, Met, and Lys was demonstrated, and it was probably related to creatine biosynthesis.",NA,"animal experiment *animal food animal tissue article body growth breast chicken concentration (parameters) controlled study diet diet supplementation enzyme activity feeding female food intake kidney parenchyma maize muscle level nonhuman nutrient content nutritional requirement *protein diet protein interaction randomization soybean weight gain arginase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *arginine creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *lysine *methionine","655-660","88","2002",-1

This paper reports a nonrandomized, nonblinded trial with historically matched controls from archival tissue designed to determine the effects of acute exposure to a dietary supplement of isoflavones in men with clinically significant prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy. Thirty-eight patients were recruited to the study upon diagnosis of prostate cancer. Before surgery, 20 men consumed 160 mg/day of red clover-derived dietary isoflavones, containing a mixture of genistein, daidzein, formononetin, and biochanin A. Serum PSA, testosterone, and biochemical factors were measured, and clinical and pathological parameters were recorded. The incidence of apoptosis in prostate tumor cells from radical prostatectomy specimens was compared between 18 treated and 18 untreated control tissues. There were no significant differences between pre- and posttreatment serum PSA, Gleason score, serum testosterone, or biochemical factors in the treated patients (P > 0.05). Apoptosis in radical prostatectomy specimens from treated patients was significantly higher than in control subjects (P = 0.0018), specifically in regions of low to moderate-grade cancer (Gleason grade 1-3). No adverse events related to the treatment were reported. This report suggests that dietary isoflavones may halt the progression of prostate cancer by inducing apoptosis in low to moderate-grade tumors, potentially contributing to the lower incidence of clinically significant disease in Asian men. The assessment of new prostatic therapies aimed at increasing apoptosis should control for intake of dietary isoflavones.",NA,"adult aged apoptosis article cancer growth cancer inhibition clinical article clover controlled study diet supplementation drug effect drug mechanism drug urine level human human tissue male priority journal *prostate carcinoma/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate carcinoma/pc [Prevention] *prostate carcinoma/su [Surgery] red clover scoring system side effect/si [Side Effect] testosterone blood level tumor cell *biochanin A/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *biochanin A/cr [Drug Concentration] *biochanin A/dt [Drug Therapy] *biochanin A/po [Oral Drug Administration] *biochanin A/pr [Pharmaceutics] *biochanin A/pd [Pharmacology] *daidzein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *daidzein/cr [Drug Concentration] *daidzein/dt [Drug Therapy] *daidzein/po [Oral Drug Administration] *daidzein/pr [Pharmaceutics] *daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] *formononetin/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *formononetin/cr [Drug Concentration] *formononetin/dt [Drug Therapy] *formononetin/po [Oral Drug Administration] *formononetin/pr [Pharmaceutics] *formononetin/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *genistein/cr [Drug Concentration] *genistein/dt [Drug Therapy] *genistein/po [Oral Drug Administration] *genistein/pr [Pharmaceutics] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *isoflavone derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *isoflavone derivative/cr [Drug Concentration] *isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone derivative/po [Oral Drug Administration] *isoflavone derivative/pr [Pharmaceutics] *isoflavone derivative/pd [Pharmacology] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone/ec [Endogenous Compound] trinovin","1689-1696","11","2002",-1

Kurzer","Isoflavones and postmenopausal women: A critical review","Isoflavonic phytoestrogens, or isoflavones, constitute a class of phytoestrogens that have properties similar to selective estrogen receptor modulators, and have attracted a substantial degree of attention in recent years, particularly as a possible alternative to the conventional hormone replacement therapy regimens used by postmenopausal women. Despite great promise, it is difficult to make many specific recommendations about their use at the current time, in light of the many outstanding questions that hopefully will be answered in the future by focused interventional studies involving humans. Studies to date indicate that the use of isoflavones to address vasomotor symptoms provides at most small benefits beyond a placebo effect, and no benefit for genital atrophy. As for postmenopausal women whose primary concern is cardiovascular disease, the recommendation of the American Heart Association to include soy protein foods as part of an otherwise healthy diet is well justified, and similarly the substitution of supplements containing soy protein for animal protein can also be recommended. The use of purified isoflavone supplements not containing soy protein may have some cardiovascular benefits, but these appear to be less substantial in degree than those provided by soy protein with isoflavones. In particular, more research is needed to assess the effects of isoflavones on osteoporosis, for which no recommendation regarding isoflavones can be made based on the current data. Also, isoflavones should not be taken by postmenopausal women for the specific purpose of decreasing their risk of breast or endometrial cancer, although, at least for those without pre-existing disease or at high risk, it seems quite unlikely that isoflavone use is harmful in this regard.",NA,"absorption bone density bone mineral breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] cancer risk cardiovascular disease clinical trial diet endometrium cancer/di [Diagnosis] endometrium cancer/ep [Epidemiology] female genital system disease hormone substitution human menopause meta analysis metabolism nonhuman osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] *postmenopause priority journal review 16alpha hydroxyestrone aromatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] biochanin A bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] daidzein daidzin equol estradiol estrogen estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrone derivative formononetin genistein genistin glucoside glycitein ipriflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *isoflavone lignan lipoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound] phytoestrogen protein tyrosine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator soybean protein steryl sulfatase/ec [Endogenous Compound] sulfotransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] testosterone 17beta dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] unindexed drug","293-311","1","2002",-1

Two categories of evidence on efficacy are considered: possible effects on disease progression and survival and possible palliative effects. In evaluating evidence on safety, two types of risk are considered: the risk for direct adverse effects and the risk for interactions with conventional treatments. For each therapy, the current balance of evidence on efficacy and safety points to whether the therapy may be reasonably recommended, accepted (for example, dietary fat reduction in well-nourished patients with breast or prostate cancer), or discouraged (for example, high-dose vitamin A supplementation). This strategy allows the development of an approach for providing responsible, evidence-based, patient-centered advice to persons with cancer who seek CAM therapies.",NA,"acupuncture *alternative medicine article breast cancer cancer growth cancer palliative therapy cancer survival *cancer therapy diet diet supplementation evidence based medicine exercise fat intake herbal medicine human massage *patient counseling priority journal prostate cancer vitamin supplementation antioxidant ascorbic acid *fat *herbaceous agent phytoestrogen *retinol","889-903","137","2002",-1

Functional foods have enjoyed a niche in bone health. Foods fortified with Ca are most popular. Other bone nutrients such as vitamin D, Mg and vitamin K are sometimes added. Future products are likely to include enhancers of Ca absorption such as inulin or whey proteins. Dietary factors that reduce urinary Ca loss (plant proteins) or suppress bone resorption (possibly phyto-oestrogens) are also gaining attention. Methodologies for evaluating the effectiveness of functional foods on bone health include measures of bone quality such as bone densitometry or measures of Ca metabolism, particularly absorption.

Major components of soy proteins are phytoestrogens, such as isoflavones. They may be responsible for the extremely low incidence of prostate and mammary tumors and possibly also of colon cancer in countries such as China and Japan. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 level is inversely related to incidence of some cancers. Levels are determined by skin exposure to ultraviolet light or, to a minor extent, nutritional uptake and by subsequent conversion of the precursor vitamin D to the active hormone by the cytochrome P450 hydroxylases CYP27A1, CYP27B1 (responsible for synthesis) and CYP24 (responsible for catabolism) in liver and kidney. However, vitamin D synthesis is also found in colonocytes and is enhanced during incipient malignancy. This may indicate an autocrine/paracrine role for this differentiation-inducing hormone in defense against progression. We were able to demonstrate that either a single large oral dose of genistein or feeding soy protein for 4 mo elevated CYP27B1 and decreased CYP24 expression in the mouse colon. Our data therefore suggest that an inverse correlation of soy product consumption with colon tumor incidence may be consequent to enhanced colonic synthesis of the antimitotic hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.",NA,"animal tissue autocrine effect breast cancer cancer growth cancer incidence *cancer prevention *cancer therapy China colon cancer *colon tumor conference paper controlled study diet hormone synthesis Japan metabolic regulation mouse nonhuman paracrine signaling prostate cancer protein expression soybean *vitamin D metabolism calcitriol/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytochroem P450 27B1/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytochrome P450/ec [Endogenous Compound] cytochrome P450 27a1/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein isoflavone derivative *phytoestrogen soybean protein unclassified drug","3490S-3493S","132","2002",-1

Loprinzi","Pathophysiology and treatment of hot flashes","Hot flashes affect about three fourths of postmenopausal women and are one of the most common health problems in this demographic group. Dysfunction of central thermoregulatory centers caused by changes in estrogen levels at the time of menopause has long been postulated to be the cause of hot flashes. Treatment should begin with a careful patient history, with specific attention to the frequency and severity of hot flashes and their effect on the individual's function. For mild symptoms that do not interfere with sleep or daily function, behavioral changes in conjunction with vitamin E (800 IU/d) use is a reasonable initial approach. For more severe symptoms, the next step is to determine whether there is a contraindication or a personal reservation to estrogen replacement therapy. For women who are able and willing to use estrogen, it will successfully relieve symptoms by about 80% to 90%. In patients with a history of breast or uterine cancer, treatment with the progestational agent megesterol acetate appears to be a safe alternative that also decreases hot flashes by approximately 80%. For women unwilling or unable to use hormone therapy, one of the newer antidepressant agents can be prescribed. Venlafaxine decreases hot flashes by about 60%. Gabapentin is another drug that appears promising as therapy for women unable or unwilling to use estrogen, and the results of ongoing trials to determine its efficacy are eagerly awaited.

Lumey","Chemoprevention strategies for prostate cancer","Prostate cancer is the most common male malignancy in western countries. Although primary prevention of prostate cancer is not possible, screening using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) may eliminate prostate cancers by definitive treatments. Prevention of clinically detectable prostate cancer requires earlier chemoprevention interventions. Because prostate cancer is histologically present in 30-50% of 30- to 50-year-old men, effective chemoprevention needs to inhibit not only prostate carcinogenesis but also growth and progression of these cancers. A prostate carcinogenesis animal model has been used to screen chemopreventive agents; inhibitory effects were found with 9-cis-retinoic acid, dehydroepiandrosterone, fluasterone, and the Bowman-Birk inhibitor and an isoflavone mixture which both occur in soy. Such results can be used to select agents for clinical trials. Besides large-scale long-duration prevention trials, trials of short/intermediate duration using smaller cohorts prior to or following radical prostatectomy may provide excellent and cost-effective approaches for chemopreventive agent efficacy testing. Intervention prior to surgery allows measurements of intervention agents and intermediate end-points in the prostate. These peri-surgical trials only assess inhibition of growth and progression of pre-existing cancer, not real preventive effects, but they focus on clinically significant cancers. Such trials are an essential step in the development of antiprostate cancer chemoprevention agents. 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",NA,"cancer screening cancer staging chemoprophylaxis conference paper cost effectiveness analysis drug efficacy growth inhibition hormone response human nonhuman primary prevention priority journal *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] tissue specificity alitretinoin/do [Drug Dose] alitretinoin/dt [Drug Therapy] alitretinoin/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone/do [Drug Dose] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] prasterone/do [Drug Dose] prasterone/dt [Drug Therapy] prasterone/pd [Pharmacology] *prostate specific antigen","S18-S27","11","2002",-1
"2329","2334"," M. H. Gaber","Modulation of doxorubicin resistance in multidrug-resistance cells by targeted liposomes combined with hyperthermia","Conventional methods that are used to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) often involve the coadministration of chemosensitizers and anticancer drugs. However, coadministration of many chemosensitizers with anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin (Dox) has resulted in the exacerbation of anticancer drug toxicity. Here, we hypothesized that optimization of the anticancer drug delivery using a liposomal carrier, a suitable targeting moiety, and a physical factor such as hyperthermia offer a significant advantage in the treatment of MDR cancer cells. Since, receptors for the vitamin folic acid are frequently overexpressed on epithelial cancer cells, we used folate as our targeting moiety against two types of cell lines, the human cervical carcinoma derived KB-31 (KB31) and the resistance type KB-85 (KB85). Folate-targeted thermosensitive liposomes were prepared by incorporating 1 mol% of a folate-polyethyleneglycol-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (folate-PEG-DSPE) construct into a lipid bilayer composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), cholesterol (Chol) and phosphatidylethanolamine derivatized at the amino position with polyethyleneglycol (PEG-PE) at a molar ratio of 100:50:30:6. Incorporation of folate-PEG-PE in the bilayer, did not affect the thermal sensitivity of the resultant liposome vesicles. Uptake of folate-PEG-liposomal Dox by KB31 cells was 15-fold higher than that of non-targeted liposomal Dox. However, in the case of MDR type KB85, the uptake of the folate PEG liposomal Dox was 2-fold higher than the non-targeted liposomal Dox. Cytotoxicity measurements showed that folated liposomes combined with hyperthermia were found to be over 3-fold more effective (IC50 = 0.16 muM) than the free drug (IC50 = 0.543 muM) for growth inhibition of KB31. For the MDR cell type KB85, the cytotoxicity of the targeted liposomes combined with hyperthermia were found to be 4.8 times (IC50 = 0.38 muM) more effective than the free drug (IC50 = 1.81 muM). Thus, liposome associated Dox may bypass the vesicular drug transport in MDR cell, resulting in the enhancement of the drug biological activity.",NA,"amino acid sequence antineoplastic activity article cancer cell culture cancer growth cancer inhibition chemosensitivity disease exacerbation drug delivery system drug release drug stability drug structure drug synthesis drug transport drug uptake encapsulation fluorescence heat sensitivity human human cell *hyperthermic therapy IC 50 lipid bilayer *multidrug resistance structure analysis target cell toxicity uterine cervix carcinoma vitamin metabolism amino acid antineoplastic agent/cb [Drug Combination] antineoplastic agent/pr [Pharmaceutics] antineoplastic agent/pd [Pharmacology] cholesterol/an [Drug Analysis] cholesterol/pr [Pharmaceutics] dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/an [Drug Analysis] dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/pr [Pharmaceutics] *doxorubicin/cb [Drug Combination] *doxorubicin/pr [Pharmaceutics] *doxorubicin/pd [Pharmacology] drug carrier/cb [Drug Combination] drug carrier/pr [Pharmaceutics] folic acid/cb [Drug Combination] folic acid/dv [Drug Development] folic acid/pr [Pharmaceutics] folic acid plus macrogol plus distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine/cb [Drug Combination] folic acid plus macrogol plus distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine/dv [Drug Development] folic acid plus macrogol plus distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine/pr [Pharmaceutics] hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine/an [Drug Analysis] hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine/pr [Pharmaceutics] *liposome/cb [Drug Combination] *liposome/pr [Pharmaceutics] macrogol/an [Drug Analysis] macrogol/pr [Pharmaceutics] phosphatidylethanolamine/an [Drug Analysis] phosphatidylethanolamine/pr [Pharmaceutics] unclassified drug vitamin receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]","309-314","6","2002",-1

The ovariectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were divided into four groups (n=8 in each), which received the following subcutaneous treatments either for 2 days or for 2 weeks: (1) solvent control (96% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) 1 ml/kg), (2) estradiol-17beta (25 mug/kg), (3) genistein (2.5 mg/kg; low-dose), and (4) genistein (25 mg/kg; high-dose). The renal arterial rings were studied using organ bath system. The renal artery contractions were attenuated by the 2-day low-dose genistein treatment as follows: angiotensin II (46%), noradrenaline (42%) KCl (36%), and endothelin-1 (34%). Only the angiotensin II-induced contractions were reduced by the 2-week treatment with estradiol-17beta (38%) and with the low-dose of genistein (31%). The 2-day genistein treatment reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, while the other treatments or treatment times had no effect. The 2-day low-dose genistein treatment had no estrogenic effect on the uterine morphology. The mechanism for attenuated contractility in the renal arteries after the 2-day low-dose genistein treatment is independent of the estrogenic effect of genistein, but is due to the tyrosine kinase inhibitory property of genistein. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Objective: The objective was to perform safety and pharmacokinetic studies of purified unconjugated isoflavone preparations containing genistein, daidzein, and glycitein in postmenopausal women. Design: Twenty-four healthy postmenopausal women ingested a single dose of 1 of 2 purified (from soybeans) isoflavone preparations that delivered a genistein dose of 2, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg body wt. These doses were higher than those previously administered to human females. Toxicity studies were performed 24 h and 3, 6, 14, and 30 d after isoflavone administration. Kinetic studies were performed during the first 24 h. Results: We observed a 7% decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a 32% decrease in the neutrophil count 24 h after treatment with formulation A. Isolated episodes of nausea, pedal edema, and breast tenderness were judged to be possibly related to the study treatment. The terminal plasma half-lives for free genistein, daidzein, and glycitein averaged 3.8, 7.7, and 3.4 h, respectively. The terminal pseudo half-lives for total genistein and total daidzein in plasma averaged 10.1 and 10.8 h, respectively. The estimated bioavailabilities of both total genistein and total daidzein from each of the 2 formulations were not significantly different. Conclusions: A single-dose administration of purified unconjugated isoflavones at amounts that exceed normal dietary intakes had minimal clinical toxicity in healthy postmenopausal women. The pharmacokinetic data suggest that chronic dosing at 12-24-h intervals would not lead to progressive accumulation of these isoflavones.",NA,"adult aged article breast cancer breast tenderness/si [Side Effect] chemoprophylaxis conjugation diastolic blood pressure dietary intake dose time effect relation drug bioavailability drug formulation drug half life drug safety female human leg edema/si [Side Effect] leukocyte count nausea/si [Side Effect] neutrophil normal human *postmenopause *soybean systolic blood pressure daidzein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] daidzein/cr [Drug Concentration] daidzein/to [Drug Toxicity] daidzein/pr [Pharmaceutics] daidzein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] genistein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] genistein/cr [Drug Concentration] genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] genistein/pr [Pharmaceutics] genistein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] glycitein/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] glycitein/cr [Drug Concentration] glycitein/to [Drug Toxicity] glycitein/pr [Pharmaceutics] glycitein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *isoflavone derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] *isoflavone derivative/cr [Drug Concentration] *isoflavone derivative/do [Drug Dose] *isoflavone derivative/to [Drug Toxicity] *isoflavone derivative/pr [Pharmaceutics] *isoflavone derivative/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","1126-1137","76","2002",-1

Part of the inconsistencies may be attributable to the difficulty in measuring intake levels of phytoestrogens. Overnight urine samples from 250 incident breast cancer cases and their individually matched controls were analyzed for urinary excretion rates of isoflavonoids, mammalian lignans, and citrus flavonoids. The study subjects were a subset of the participants in the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, a large population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai from 1996-1998. To minimize potential influence of treatment on the exposure of interest, urine samples from breast cancer cases were collected before cancer therapy. Urinary excretion of total isoflavonoids and mammalian lignans was substantially lower in breast cancer cases than in controls. The median excretion rate of total isoflavonoids was 13.97 nmol/mg creatinine in cases and 23.09 in controls (P = 0.01), and the median excretion rate of total lignans was 1.77 in cases and 4.16 in controls (P < 0.01). The risk of breast cancer was reduced with increasing excretion of total isoflavonoids (P for trend, 0.04) and total lignans (P for trend, <0.01), with adjusted odds ratios of 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.99) and 0.40 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.64) observed for the highest versus the lowest tertile of total isoflavonoid and lignan excretion, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio was 0.28 (95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.50) for women who had a high excretion rate of both total lignans and isoflavonoids compared with those with a low excretion of both groups of phytoestrogens. No association was observed with citrus flavonoids.

Biochanin A regulated the cell cycle progression in a similar manner and showed a delay in the progression from the S phase to the G2/M phase at growth inhibitory concentrations. The levels of a cell cycle regulatory protein, P53, in response to the treatment of isoflavones, were also determined. Cells that became de-attached and floated in the medium after treatment with growth inhibitory concentrations of daidzein or biochanin A, showed higher P53 levels than cells that remained attached.

DNA methylation is thought to inhibit transcription of genes by regulating alterations in chromatin structure. Estrogenic compounds have been reported to regulate DNA methylation in a small number of studies. Additionally, phytoestrogens are believed to affect progression of some human diseases, such as estrogen-dependent cancers, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Specifically, our working hypothesis is that certain soy phytoestrogens, such as genistein, may be involved in preventing the development of certain prostate and mammary cancers by maintaining a protective DNA methylation profile. The objective of the present study is to use mouse differential methylation hybridization (DMH) arrays to test for changes in the methylation status of the cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) islands in the mouse genome by examining how these methylation patterns are affected by genistein. Male mice were fed a casein-based diet (control) or the same diet containing 300 mg genistein/kg according to one of four regimens: control diet for 4 wk, genistein diet for 4 wk, control diet for 2 wk followed by genistein diet for 2 wk and genistein diet for 2 wk followed by control diet for 2 wk. DNA from liver, brain and prostate were then screened with DMH arrays. Clones with methylation differences were sequenced and compared with known sequences. In conclusion, consumption of genistein diet was positively correlated with changes in prostate DNA methylation at CpG islands of specific mouse genes.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue breast cancer cancer cancer screening cardiovascular disease chromatin structure conference paper controlled study CpG island *DNA methylation genetic transcription mouse nonhuman osteoporosis prostate cancer *genistein","2419S-2423S","132","2002",-1

To determine the acid-sensitivity of their antigen binding sites, human MAbs against human sperm (H6-3C4) and gp120 of HIV (1511) were tested by ELISA for binding to human sperm and recombinant gp120, respectively, at pH 3.0-7.0, after storing them for 1 or 20 h at the same pH. Binding was unaltered by acidic pH>4 even after 20 h, and at pH 3.5 both MAbs retained >40% antigen binding activity. A humanized MAb against HSV-2 glycoprotein B expressed both in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in soybean cells was incubated for 1 or 24 h at pH 3.5-7.6, brought to neutral pH, and tested for ability to block HSV-2 infection of foreskin fibroblast cells. Loss in blocking activity occurred only when antibodies were incubated at pH 3.5 for 24 h and was independent of the expression cell type. Using empirical structure-based methods, net charge, Z, and electrostatic contributions to free energy, Gel, were calculated as a function of pH for 1 human and 8 murine F(ab)s. The calculations indicate that Z changes slowly between pH 5.0 and 9.0 and that Gel is nearly constant between pH 4.0 and 10 for all the F(ab)s and, therefore, human antibodies should remain stable in this pH range. Taken together, our data and empirical calculations suggest that vaginally applied human MAbs are likely to remain stable and active throughout the duration they are likely to reside in the vagina. 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Park","Ipriflavone inhibits osteolytic bone metastasis of human breast cancer cells in a nude mouse model","Osteolytic bone metastasis is a frequent problem in the treatment of cancer. Ipriflavone, a synthetic isoflavone that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption, has been used for the treatment of osteoporosis in some countries. Some other isoflavones also exhibit an antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo. Here, we studied the effects of ipriflavone on osteolytic bone metastasis of MDA-231 human breast cancer cells injected intracardially into athymic nude mice (ICR-nu/nu). Daily oral administration of ipriflavone at 12 mg/mouse significantly inhibited the development of new osteolytic bone metastases (p < 0.05) and the progression of established osteolytic lesions (p = 0.01), prolonging the life of tumor-bearing mice (p = 0.01 vs. control). In addition, ipriflavone reduced the number of osteoclasts at the bone-cancer interface with no severe adverse effects on the host. In vitro, ipriflavone inhibited the proliferation and DNA synthesis of MDA-231 cells and blocked the ligand-induced phosphorylation of Tyr845 of the EGFR. Ipriflavone did not promote apoptosis of MDA-231 cells. Our results show that ipriflavone not only directly inhibits the growth of cancer cells but also reduces osteoclasts to prevent the soft tissue tumor burden and osteolytic bone metastases. These findings raise the possibility that ipriflavone may be of use as a therapeutic agent against osteolytic bone metastasis. 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue antineoplastic activity apoptosis article *bone metastasis/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cell proliferation controlled study DNA synthesis inhibition human human cell mouse nonhuman nude mouse osteoclast *osteolysis osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] priority journal protein phosphorylation epidermal growth factor receptor *ipriflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] *ipriflavone/po [Oral Drug Administration] *ipriflavone/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/po [Oral Drug Administration] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] tyrosine","381-387","100","2002",-1

Yu","Prevention and treatment of breast cancer by suppressing aromatase activity and expression","Estrogen promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Aromatase is the enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen. In tumors, expression of aromatase is upregulated compared to that of surrounding noncancerous tissue. Tumor aromatase is thought to stimulate breast cancer growth in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner. A treatment strategy for breast cancer is to abolish in situ estrogen formation with aromatase inhibitors. In addition, aromatase suppression in postmenopausal women is being evaluated as a potential chemopreventive modality against breast cancer. One area of aromatase research in this laboratory is the identification of foods and dietary compounds that can suppress aromatase activity. In vitro and in vivo studies have found that grapes and mushrooms contain chemicals that can inhibit aromatase. Therefore, a diet that includes grapes and mushrooms would be considered preventative against breast cancer. Another area of our aromatase research is the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of aromatase expression in breast cancer tissue. Increased aromatase expression in breast tumors is attributed to changes in the transcriptional control of aromatase expression. Whereas promoter 1.4 is the main promoter that controls aromatase expression in noncancerous breast tissue, promoters II and I.3 are the dominant promoters that drive aromatase expression in breast cancer tissue. Our recent gene regulation studies revealed that in cancerous versus normal tissue, several positive regulatory proteins (e.g., nuclear receptors and CREB1) are present at higher levels and several negative regulatory proteins (e.g., snail and slug proteins) are present at lower levels. This may explain why the activity of promoters II and I.3 is upregulated in cancerous tissue. In addition, our in vitro transcription/translation analysis using plasmids containing T7 promoter and the human snail gene as a reporter capped with different untranslated exon Is revealed that exon PII-containing transcripts were translated more effectively than were exon I.3-containing transcripts. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aromatase expression between noncancerous and cancerous breast tissue, at both transcriptional and translational levels, may help in the design of a therapy based on suppressing aromatase expression in breast cancer tissue.",NA,"*breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *breast cancer/et [Etiology] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] breast carcinogenesis/et [Etiology] cancer prevention cancer therapy clinical trial conference paper dietary intake drug mechanism *enzyme inhibition gene activity gene control grape grape juice human mushroom nonhuman promoter region protein expression transcription regulation translation regulation anastrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] anastrozole/pd [Pharmacology] antiestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] antiestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] *aromatase aromatase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] aromatase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen flavone/pd [Pharmacology] isoflavone/pd [Pharmacology] letrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] letrozole/pd [Pharmacology] lignan/pd [Pharmacology] phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] plant extract/an [Drug Analysis] plant extract/pd [Pharmacology] regulator protein tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] vorozole/ct [Clinical Trial] vorozole/dt [Drug Therapy] vorozole/pd [Pharmacology]","229-238","963","2002",-1

Our aim was to compare the effect of palm oil (mainly saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids) and soybean oil (mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids) on the recovery from malnutrition in guinea pigs. In a first experiment, guinea pigs received a balanced (control group) or a maize (malnourished group) diet for 7, 12, and 21 d. In a second experiment, after 12 d of malnutrition, guinea pigs received a rehabilitation diet containing palm or soybean oil. Both rehabilitation diets allowed a partial recovery from the severe weight loss induced by malnutrition. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content, measured in intestinal homogenates, increased in malnourished guinea pigs compared with control animals (40%, p < 0.05) and returned to near control values after rehabilitation with palm (10%) but not soybean (43%) oil diet. Intestinal short-circuit current, assessed in jejunal segments mounted in Ussing chambers, increased progressively during malnutrition (p < 0.001) and returned to near control values with both rehabilitation diets. Compared with control animals, the cell turnover (Ki-67 index assessed by immunohistochemistry detection of the Ki-67 antigen) decreased after soybean (-60%, p < 0.01) but not after palm oil. These results confirm that experimental polydeficient malnutrition induces oxidative stress and dysfunction in the intestine. They show a differential effect of palm and soybean oil on these intestinal measurements, suggesting that the composition of dietary lipids may be important in the treatment of malnutrition.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue article controlled study disease severity fat intake guinea pig immunohistochemistry *intestine jejunum lipid composition male *malnutrition measurement nonhuman oxidative stress priority journal short circuit current weight reduction Ki 67 antigen monounsaturated fatty acid *palm oil polyunsaturated fatty acid *soybean oil thiobarbituric acid reactive substance","119-124","52","2002",-1

Sarkar","Expression of prostate-specific antigen is transcriptionally regulated by genistein in prostate cancer cells","Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men in the United States. Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy when prostate cancer becomes metastatic and refractory to conventional treatments. For this reason, the identification and exploration of new agents that reduce prostate cancer cell growth are of paramount importance. High consumption of plant-derived phytoestrogens is inversely associated with the incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer. Previous studies, including our own, have shown that the phytoestrogen genistein inhibits prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and decreases secreted and intracellular levels of the androgen-regulated protein prostate-specific antigen (PSA), but the role of genistein as an agonist/antagonist for hormone receptors remains unclear. To elucidate the mechanism by which genistein modulates PSA protein expression in prostate cancer cells, we investigated the effects of genistein on androgen-mediated and estrogen-mediated transcriptional regulation of PSA, androgen receptor (AR) mRNA and protein expression, and the ability of nuclear proteins to bind to androgen-response elements (AREs) in LNCaP cells. We showed that genistein decreased the transcriptional activation of PSA by both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent methods in LNCaP cells. The reduction of androgen-mediated transcriptional activation of PSA was correlated with decreased AR protein and mRNA levels and decreased binding to AREs. In contrast, genistein had differential effects on 17beta-estradiol-mediated PSA expressions. Low concentrations of genistein enhanced 17beta-estradiol-mediated PSA expressions, whereas high concentrations of genistein inhibited estrogen-mediated PSA expression in LNCaP cells. Genistein did not inhibit AR protein expression in the presence of 17beta-estradiol. These results suggest that ligand-dependent differences in the ability to activate PSA expression may contribute to the agonistic/antagonistic responses observed with genistein in prostate cancer cells. 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"antigen expression article *cancer cell culture controlled study drug effect gene control hormone responsive element human human cell priority journal *prostate cancer/et [Etiology] protein DNA binding protein expression *transcription regulation androgen androgen receptor daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol estrogen *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA nuclear protein phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] *prostate specific antigen","91-101","34","2002",-1

Montiel","Muscarinic activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in rat thyroid epithelial cells","Carbachol (Cch), a muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) agonist, produces time- and dose-dependent increases in mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) phosphorylation in nondifferentiated Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells. Cells pretreatment with the selective phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 resulted in a decrease of Cch-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These data indicated that the effect of mAChR on ERK activation could be mediated through agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization or PKC activation. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was mimicked by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate acetate (PMA), but was not altered either by PKC inhibitor GF109203X or by down-regulation of PKC. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was elevated by a direct [Ca2+]i increase caused by thapsigargin or ionophore. Additionally, Cch-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reduced after either inhibition of Ca2+ influx or intracellular Ca2+ release. Nevertheless, Cch-mediated ERK1/2 activation was genistein sensitive, indicating the involvement of protein tyrosine kinases on the downstream signalling of mAChR. Pretreatment of the cells with PP2 markedly decreased Cch-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting a role of Src family of tyrosine kinases in the signal transduction pathway involved in ERK1/2 activation by mAChR. To test the biological consequences of ERK activation, we examined the effect of mAChR on cell functions. Cch stimulation of FRT cells did not affect cell proliferation, but increased protein synthesis. This effect was significantly attenuated by PD98059, a selective inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK/MEK). This study demonstrated that muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in the ERK1/2 phosphorylation was dependent on [Ca2+]i but independent of PKC and was mediated by the Src family of tyrosine kinases. Our results also supported the idea that the protein synthesis stimulated by mAChR in polarized FRT epithelial cells was regulated by the ERK1/2 phosphorylation pathway. 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The present study was undertaken to compare the anti-tumor effects of soy protein isolate and those of its isoflavones: genistein and daidzein. Six groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed modified corn starch AIN76A diets supplemented with: no additional agents (control); purified genistein at 200 mg/kg diet; purified daidzein at 200 mg/kg diet; a combination of genistein and daidzein at 100 mg/kg diet each; soy protein isolate enriched in isoflavones (SPI+); or soy protein isolate depleted of isoflavones (SPI-). Mammary carcinomas were induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) injected one week after the animals started eating the experimental diets. At the end of the study (120 days post-DMBA treatment), no significant differences were found among the six groups with respect to tumor incidence or survival. However, there was a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in tumor multiplicity in the daidzein (5.45) and SPI+ (5.45) groups, when compared to the control group (8.05). The most effective diet was the SPI-, which produced a highly signifi-cant (p < 0.01) reduction in tumor multiplicity (4.05). Tumor latency was increased from 53 days in the control group to 68 days in the daidzein group and to 72 days in the SPI-group. Both SPI groups, but not the genistein or daidzein groups, up-regulated transcriptional expression of the anti-oxidant enzymes NAD(P)H:quinone reductase (QR) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya2. These results suggest that the mode of chemopreventive action of soy protein isolate is distinct from that of the main soy isoflavones.

However, cellular aspects of the immunologic development of soy-fed infants have not been studied extensively. Nucleotides added to milk-based formula benefit infant immune status, but reports of the immunologic effects of adding nucleotides to soy-based formula are not available. This study examines immune cell populations of infants fed soy protein isolate formulas with and without added nucleotides for 1 year. Methods: Newborn, term infants studied in a masked 12-month feeding trial were assigned randomly to soy formula groups with and without added nucleotides (n = 94, n = 92). A nonrandomized human milk/formula-fed cohort (n = 81), was concurrently enrolled. Blood samples were collected at 6, 7, and 12 months. Thirty-two immune cell populations were characterized using three-color flow cytometry. Cellular markers were chosen to assess general pediatric immune status, emphasizing maturation and activation of B, T, and NK lymphocytes. Results: All cell populations, number and percentages, were within age-related normal ranges. The only significant difference found between soy formula and human milk/formula-fed infants was the percentage of CD57+ NK T cells at 12 months (human milk/formula > soy formula, P = 0.034). There were significant differences at some time points between human milk/formula-fed and nucleotide-supplemented soy formula-fed infants in populations of lymphocytes, eosinophils, total T, helper T, naive helper, memory/effector helper, CD57-T, and CD11b+CD8+NK cells. None of the cell populations differed between infants fed soy formula versus soy plus nucleotides. Conclusions: Infants fed this commercial soy formula demonstrated immune cell status similar to human milk/formula-fed infants, consistent with normal immune system development. The addition of nucleotides to soy formula did not significantly change specific individual immune cell populations but tended to increase numbers and percentages of T cells and decreased numbers and percentages of NK cells. 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",NA,"article *artificial milk B lymphocyte activation blood sampling cell activation cell count cell maturation *cell population controlled study effector cell eosinophil flow cytometry helper cell human *immune response immunization *immunocompetent cell major clinical study memory cell natural killer cell newborn priority journal *protein intake T lymphocyte activation *nucleotide *soybean protein","145-153","34","2002",-1

Baracat","Benefits of soy isoflavone therapeutic regimen on menopausal symptoms","OBJECTIVE: To examine the change in menopausal symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors in response to 4 months of daily 100-mg soy isoflavone in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 80 women were randomly assigned to isoflavone (n = 40) and placebo (n = 40) treatment. The menopausal Kupperman index was used to assess change in menopausal symptoms at baseline and after 4 months of treatment. Cardiovascular risk factors were assessed by evaluating plasma lipid levels, body mass index, blood pressure, and glucose levels in the participants. To examine the effects of this regime on endogenous hormone levels, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and 17beta-estradiol were measured. Transvaginal sonography was performed to quantify endometrial thickness. RESULTS: The data showed a decrease in menopausal symptoms (P < .01, paired t test, two-tailed, between baseline and isoflavone groups, and P < .01, unpaired t test, between placebo and isoflavone groups). Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein decreased significantly in the isoflavone group compared with the baseline or placebo group (P < .001, paired t test, two-tailed, between baseline and isoflavone groups, and P < .01, unpaired test, between placebo and isoflavone groups). The isoflavone treatment appeared to have no effect on blood pressure, plasma glucose, and high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that isoflavone 100-mg regime treatment may be a safe and effective alternative therapy for menopausal symptoms and may offer a benefit to the cardiovascular system. 2002 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",NA,"aged article blood pressure body mass cardiovascular risk cholesterol blood level clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study double blind procedure estradiol blood level follitropin blood level glucose blood level hormone blood level human lipid blood level lipoprotein blood level luteinizing hormone blood level major clinical study *menopausal syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy] menopause priority journal randomized controlled trial transvaginal echography triacylglycerol blood level estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] follitropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] glucose/ec [Endogenous Compound] high density lipoprotein/ec [Endogenous Compound] hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] *isoflavone derivative/ct [Clinical Trial] *isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] placebo triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","389-394","99","2002",1

Stock","Antiresorptive treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis: Comparison of study designs and outcomes in large clinical trials with fracture as an endpoint","Antiresorptive treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis have been studied extensively, but due to the volume of published data and lack of head-to-head trials, it is difficult to evaluate and compare their fracture reduction efficacy. The objective of this review is to summarize the results from clinical trials that have fracture as an endpoint and to discuss the factors in study design and populations that can affect the interpretation of the results. Although there are numerous observational studies suggesting that estrogen and hormone replacement therapies may reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures, there is no large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial demonstrating fracture efficacy. The effects of raloxifene, alendronate, risedronate, and salmon calcitonin on increasing bone mineral density (BMD) and decreasing fracture risk have been shown in randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Although the increases in lumbar spine BMD vary greatly in these trials, the decrease in relative risk of vertebral fractures is similar among therapies. However, nonvertebral fracture efficacy has not been consistently demonstrated. Combined administration of two antiresorptive therapies results in greater BMD increases, but the effects on fracture risk are unknown. Direct comparisons of clinical trial results should be considered carefully, given the differences in study design and populations. Differences in study design that may influence the efficacy of fracture risk reduction include calcium and vitamin D supplementation, primary fracture endpoints, definition of vertebral deformity or fracture, discontinuation rates, and statistical power. Factors in the study population that may influence fracture efficacy include the age of the population and the proportion of subjects with prevalent fractures. The use of surrogate endpoints such as BMD to predict fracture risk should be approached with caution, as the relationship between BMD changes and fracture risk reduction with antiresorptive therapies is uncertain. Consideration of these results from clinical trials can contribute to clinical judgment in selecting the best treatment option for postmenopausal osteoporosis.",NA,"adult age aged bone density bone mineral breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study diet supplementation double blind procedure drug efficacy estrogen therapy female *fracture/co [Complication] *fracture/dt [Drug Therapy] *fracture/pc [Prevention] gastrointestinal symptom/si [Side Effect] hormone substitution human ischemic heart disease/dt [Drug Therapy] ischemic heart disease/pc [Prevention] meta analysis methodology nonhuman osteolysis *osteoporosis/dt [Drug Therapy] population research *postmenopause prevalence priority journal randomized controlled trial review risk benefit analysis risk management statistical analysis thromboembolism/si [Side Effect] treatment outcome alendronic acid/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] alendronic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] alendronic acid/do [Drug Dose] alendronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] alfacalcidol/ct [Clinical Trial] alfacalcidol/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] bisphosphonic acid derivative/ct [Clinical Trial] bisphosphonic acid derivative/cb [Drug Combination] bisphosphonic acid derivative/do [Drug Dose] bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/to [Drug Toxicity] calcitriol/ct [Clinical Trial] calcitriol/do [Drug Dose] calcitriol/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium/ct [Clinical Trial] calcium/do [Drug Dose] calcium/dt [Drug Therapy] conjugated estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] conjugated estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] conjugated estrogen/do [Drug Dose] conjugated estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] cyproterone acetate/ct [Clinical Trial] cyproterone acetate/do [Drug Dose] cyproterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/ct [Clinical Trial] estradiol/do [Drug Dose] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] estradiol valerate/ct [Clinical Trial] estradiol valerate/do [Drug Dose] estradiol valerate/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] estrogen/do [Drug Dose] estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] estrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] estrogen/td [Transdermal Drug Administration] etidronic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] etidronic acid/cb [Drug Combination] etidronic acid/do [Drug Dose] etidronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/ct [Clinical Trial] gestagen/do [Drug Dose] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] medroxyprogesterone acetate/ct [Clinical Trial] medroxyprogesterone acetate/do [Drug Dose] medroxyprogesterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] mestranol/ct [Clinical Trial] mestranol/do [Drug Dose] mestranol/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] placebo progesterone/ct [Clinical Trial] progesterone/do [Drug Dose] progesterone/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/ct [Clinical Trial] raloxifene/cm [Drug Comparison] raloxifene/do [Drug Dose] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] risedronic acid/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] risedronic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] risedronic acid/do [Drug Dose] risedronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] salcatonin/ct [Clinical Trial] salcatonin/dt [Drug Therapy] salcatonin/na [Intranasal Drug Administration] selective estrogen receptor modulator/ct [Clinical Trial] selective estrogen receptor modulator/do [Drug Dose] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] sex hormone/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] sex hormone/ct [Clinical Trial] sex hormone/cb [Drug Combination] sex hormone/do [Drug Dose] sex hormone/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/ct [Clinical Trial] tamoxifen/cm [Drug Comparison] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] tibolone/ct [Clinical Trial] tibolone/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D/ct [Clinical Trial] vitamin D/do [Drug Dose] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] vitamin D derivative/ct [Clinical Trial] vitamin D derivative/do [Drug Dose] vitamin D derivative/dt [Drug Therapy]","16-37","23","2002",-1
"2399","2418"," M. N. Jacobs, D. F. V. Lewis","Steroid hormone receptors and dietary ligands: A selected review","Members of the nuclear steroid hormone superfamily mediate essential physiological functions. Steroid hormone receptors (SHR) act directly on DNA, regulate the synthesis of their target genes and are usually activated by ligand binding. Both endogenous and exogenous compounds and their metabolites may act as activators of SHR and disruptors of endocrine, cellular and lipid homeostasis. The endogenous ligands are generally steroids such as 17beta-oestradiol, androgens, progesterone and pregnenolone. The exogenous compounds are usually delivered through the diet and include non-steroidal ligands. Examples of such ligands include isoflavanoids or phytooestrogens, and food contaminants such as exogenous oestrogens from hormone-treated cattle, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls and plasticisers. Certain drugs are also ligands; so nuclear receptors are also important drug targets for intervention in disease processes. The present review summarises recent reports on ligand-activated SHR that describe the selective regulation of a tightly-controlled cross-talking network involving exchange of ligands, and the control of major classes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms which metabolise many bioactive exogenous compounds. Many CYP have broad substrate activity and appear to be integrated into a coordinated metabolic pathway, such that whilst some receptors are ligand specific, other sensors may have a broader specificity and low ligand affinity to monitor aggregate levels of inducers. They can then trigger production of metabolising enzymes to defend against possible toxic nutrients and xenobiotic compounds. The influence of dietary intakes of nutrients and non-nutrients on the human oestrogen receptors (alpha and beta), the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the pregnane X receptor, the constitutive androstane receptor, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (alpha and ), can be examined by utilising computer-generated molecular models of the ligand-receptor interaction, based on information generated from crystallographic data and sequence homology. In relation to experimental and observed data, molecular modelling can provide a scientifically sound perspective on the potential risk and benefits to human health from dietary exposure to hormone-mimicking chemicals, providing a useful tool in drug development and in a situation of considerable public concern.",NA,"brain function *breast cancer/et [Etiology] carcinogenesis conference paper dietary intake enzyme activity estrogen blood level hormone metabolism *hormone receptor interaction human ligand binding molecular model nonhuman nutrient *ovary cancer/et [Etiology] receptor binding transcription regulation xenobiotic metabolism *androgen androgen receptor antioxidant aromatic hydrocarbon receptor cytochrome P450 *estradiol *estrogen receptor isoflavone ligand peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma pesticide/to [Drug Toxicity] phytoestrogen plasticizer/to [Drug Toxicity] polychlorinated biphenyl/to [Drug Toxicity] pregnane X receptor pregnenolone progesterone *steroid receptor","105-122","61","2002",-1

The suppressive effects on ovarian cyclicity are mimicked by a mitogenic agent purified from the ground corncob bedding material (corn mitogen; CM), which stimulates the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7 cells) and ER-negative (MDA-MD-231 cells) breast cancer cells. Purified CM does not compete for [3H]estradiol binding to ER or nuclear type II sites, and its effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation are not blocked by the antiestrogen ICI-182,780. These results suggest that the active component is unlikely to be a phytoestrogen, bioflavonoid, mycotoxin, or other known endocrine-disrupting agent that modifies cell growth via ER or type II [3H] estradiol binding sites. CM also stimulates the proliferation of PC-3 human prostatic cancer cells in vitro, and the growth rate of PC-3 cell xenografts is accelerated in nude male mice housed on ground corncob as opposed to pure cellulose bedding. Consequently, this endocrine-disrupting agent in ground corncob bedding may influence behavioral and physiologic reproductive response profiles and malignant cell proliferation in experimental animals.

Objective: We conducted safety studies of purified unconjugated genistein, daidzein, and glycitein, and defined pharmacokinetic parameters for their absorption and metabolism. Design: Thirty healthy men ingested a single dose of 1 of 2 isoflavone preparations purified from soy. The delivered doses of genistein (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg body wt) were higher than those previously administered to humans. Formulation A was composed of 90 + 5% genistein, 10% daidzein, and 1% glycitein. Formulation B was composed of 43% genistein, 21% daidzein, and 2% glycitein. Results: We observed no clinically significant behavioral or physical changes after treatment. We observed elevations in lipoprotein lipase and hypophosphatemia that were possibly related to the treatment but that were associated with no clinical toxicity. Considerable quantities of isoflavones were excreted in urine as conjugates. The terminal elimination rate, elimination half-life, area under the curve, maximum plasma concentration, apparent systemic clearance, and volume of distribution were estimated for genistein and daidzein. The mean elimination half-lives with both formulations were 3.2 h for free genistein and 4.2 h for free daidzein. The mean pseudo half-lives were 9.2 h for total genistein and 8.2 h for total daidzein. Conclusions: Dietary supplements of purified unconjugated isoflavones administered to humans in single doses exceeding normal dietary intake manyfold resulted in minimal clinical toxicity.

The phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein are major components of soy and molecular epidemiology suggets that these substances contribute to the lower tumor incidences. We have investigated the effect of these substances on tumor cell migration, a mandatary prerequisite for metastasis formation. We could show that genistein decreases the cell locomotion of tumor cells by inhibiting part of the locomotory machinery. Genistein decreases the ras promotor strength and the binding of Sp1 transcription factor to ras regulatory element. As genes of the ras family transcribe for GTP-binding proteins, important partners in a signal transduction pathway, which transduces incoming signals onto the cytoskeleton in order to induce cell shape change and migration, are impaired. If there is a malfunction or decreased expression of the ras genes, we record in the presence of genistein, but not daidzein, an inhibition of cell locomotion. In a clinical study, carried out in two ethnicities (India and Germany), we monitored the genistein and daidzein levels of participants, who have supplemented their daily, free-selected and traditional nutrition with a specially fermented soy-honey-milk product (Almased*). In both ethnic groups, we measured a 10 to 20 fold increase of the serum concentrations for genistein and daidzein above baseline values without soy-enriched diet supplementation.

From epidemiological studies it is well known that Asian compared to Western people do have a lower risk for some tumor entities, like prostate or breast cancer, which can be correlated to the natural diet, rich in isoflavonoids. Laboratory studies clearly indicate that genistein and daidzein do have molecular targets, when blocked, inhibit tumor growth. Therefore, it is consequent to support successful antitumor protocols by diets, the ingredients of which are known not to interact with or to diminish the cytotoxic principles, but deliver tumor inhibiting or preventing substances with no adverse side effects.

Here, we demonstrate that this reciprocal cross-talk occurs in vivo. Ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice fed an atherogenic diet had increased hepatic levels of active NF-B and numerous inflammatory genes, including MHC invariant chain (Ii), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and RANTES. Treatment with 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE) strongly blocked induction of these genes but had no effect on their basal expression levels. ER was required for this activity, because the antagonist ICI 182,780 completely blocked the inhibitory activity of EE. Gene activation by EE was not required for inhibition of inflammatory gene expression, because both the phytoestrogen genistein and low doses of EE were effective in blocking inflammatory gene induction without inducing marker genes such as intestinal trefoil factor (ITF) or myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (IPS). The in vivo transcriptional interference was reciprocal, with EE induction of ITF and IPS greatly reduced in animals fed the atherogenic diet versus chow-fed controls. This interference was specific to the liver, because diet had no effect on uterine weight increases produced by EE. Transfection experiments confirmed that the extent of inhibition of ER-mediated transcription by inflammatory stimuli correlated with the extent of NF-B activation. These results suggest that the cross-talk between ER and NF-B does occur in vivo and may indeed contribute significantly to the cardioprotective effects of estrogen.",NA,"animal cell article atherogenic diet atherosclerosis coronary artery disease *drug antagonism estrogen therapy gene activation gene expression regulation mouse nonhuman postmenopause priority journal protein protein interaction transcription regulation vascular smooth muscle *estrogen receptor ethinylestradiol *immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein RANTES transcription factor tumor necrosis factor alpha vascular cell adhesion molecule 1","823-830","89","2001",-1

Osmotic swelling of human cervical cancer cells induced a substantial increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by the activation of Ca2+ entry across the cell membrane, as well as Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. This Ca2+ signalling was critical for the normal regulatory volume decrease (RVD) response. 3. The activation of swelling-activated ion and taurine transport was significantly inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein and tyrphostin AG 1478) and potentiated by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4. However, the Src family of tyrosine kinases was not involved in regulation of the swelling-activated Cl- channel. 4. Cell swelling triggered mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/ERK2) and p38 kinase. The volume-responsive ERK1/ERK2 signalling pathway linked with the activation of K+ and Cl- channels, and taurine transport. However, the volume-regulatory mechanism was independent of the activation of p38 MAP kinase. 5. The phosphorylated ERK1/ERK2 expression following a hypotonic shock was up-regulated by protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and down-regulated by PKC inhibitor staurosporine. The response of ERK activation to hypotonicity also required Ca2+ entry and depended on tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated/ERK-activating kinase (MEK) activity. 6. Considering the results overall, osmotic swelling promotes the activation of tyrosine kinase and ERK1/ERK2 and raises intracellular Ca2+, all of which play a crucial role in the volume-regulatory mechanism of human cervical cancer cells.",NA,"article calcium cell level *calcium signaling calcium transport cancer cell culture cell membrane cell swelling controlled study enzyme regulation extracellular space human human cell muscle hypotonia osmosis priority journal protein expression protein phosphorylation shock signal transduction *uterine cervix cancer 4 (3 chloroanilino) 6,7 dimethoxyquinazoline *calcium ion/ec [Endogenous Compound] chloride channel genistein *mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] mitogen activated protein kinase kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate potassium channel protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein kinase C activator protein tyrosine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor synaptophysin/ec [Endogenous Compound] taurine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *tyrosine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","347-362","537","2001",-1

Sloane","Plasma membrane association of cathepsin B in human prostate cancer: Biochemical and immunogold electron microscopic analysis","BACKGROUND. Cathepsin B (CB), a cysteine protease, is usually found in perinuclear lysosomes of epithelial cells of normal organs and non-malignant tumors, but is associated with the plasma membranes of many solid organ malignant tumors. Plasma membrane localized CB facilitates degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and progression of tumor cells from one biological compartment to another. The activities of CB and its subcellular distribution have not been investigated in malignant prostate. Our objective was to examine the subcellular distribution of CB by determining the activities of CB in lysosome and plasma membrane/ endosome subcellular fractions and its subcellular localization by immunogold electron microscopy. METHODS. Prostate tissue pieces obtained immediately after prostatectomy were homogenized and fractionated into subcellular components for determining biochemical activities of CB and cysteine protease inhibitors (CPIs). Distribution of CB was compared with that of prostate specific antigen (PSA, a serine protease), which is abundant in secretory vesicles and granules of normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and malignant prostate cells. Localization of CB was investigated in resin embedded lysosomes and plasma membrane/ endosome subcellular fractions and in prostate tissue sections by immunogold electron microscopy. RESULTS. We have demonstrated the specificity of CB activity in human prostate homogenates by using a variety of inhibitors in our assay. We did not find any difference in the specific activity of CB based on protein or DNA content in homogenates of malignant prostate (Gleason histologic scores 5-7) and BPH (no histological evidence of cancer) whether it was measured by chromogenic or fluorogenic peptide substrate assay techniques. We found significantly higher activities of CB in the plasma membrane/endosome fractions of malignant prostate than in BPH. In contrast, CPI activity was increased relative to CB activity in plasma membrane/ endosome fraction of BPH versus prostate cancer. Our data indicated a shift in the balance of enzyme to inhibitor that would favor increased activities of CB in prostate cancer. The immunogold microscopic study showed specific localization of CB in plasma membrane. They also showed localization of CB in lysosomes that were often adjacent to luminal and/or basal surfaces of malignant cells in contrast to the usual perinuclear distribution of lysosomes in hyperplastic prostate glands. PSA was localized in secretory granules and vesicles, including the plasma membranes and secretory blebs in malignant prostate cells. Occasional PSA positive secretory vesicles or membrane profiles were seen in the plasma membrane/endosomal and lysosomal fractions. CONCLUSIONS. The increased activity of CB in plasma membrane/endosomal fractions is associated with malignant prostate and not with BPH or normal prostate. Morphologic distribution CB is associated with the plasma membranes or lysosomes adjacent to apical and basal cell surfaces. This distribution is characteristic feature prostate cancer cells, but not in BPH or normal prostate cells. Subcellular distribution of PSA occurs in secretory vesicles and granules of the cytoplasm, but not in lysosomes. Our biochemical and morphological data could be used to distinguish malignant prostates from non-malignant tumors. 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"article cancer grading carcinogenesis *cell membrane cell structure cellular distribution clinical article *electron microscopy enzyme activity human human tissue *immunogold staining priority journal *prostate cancer/di [Diagnosis] *prostate cancer/et [Etiology] prostate hypertrophy/et [Etiology] scoring system 4 chloromercuribenzoic acid antipain aprotinin *cathepsin B/ec [Endogenous Compound] chymostatin *cysteine proteinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] cysteine proteinase inhibitor iodoacetic acid leupeptin pepstatin prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] soybean trypsin inhibitor","172-184","49","2001",-1

Among the various administration routes tested, GST-P became immunohistochemically demonstrable in the liver centrilobular zone 3 after 24-48h on administration of prostaglandin J2's, 15-deoxy-12,14-PGJ2, PGJ2 and 12-PGJ2 to male rats via the portal vein, whereby the animals had been pretreated with Soya oil intraperitoneally to exhaust fatty acid binding proteins. Unsaturated aldehydes, 4-hydroxynonenal, crotonaldehyde and acrolein, given by the same route induced putatively preneoplastic single cells positive for GST-P. As these lipid peroxidation end products are the substrates as well as inducers of the enzyme, its physiological function could be their detoxication. These results indicate that GST-P expression can be mediated through lipid peroxidation possibly accounting for induction observed with a wide variety of carcinogens.

Gustafsson","Selective estrogen receptor modulators and coronary heart disease","The vasculature has been recognized as an important target of estrogen action through rapid non-genomic effects and/or via the classic pathway (genomic effects) involving estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and ER-beta). Multiple mechanisms participate in the regulation of different estrogen-controlled genes, providing a wide spectrum of possibilities for development of drugs, including pure agonists or antagonists or mixed agonists/antagonists, the so-called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). In theory, an ideal SERM should reduce the risks of coronary heart disease (CHD) and preserve bone density, without or with very low incidences of breast and endometrial neoplasms or venous thromboembolism (VTE). The precise mechanism for the protective effects of estrogens and their receptors on cardiovascular diseases is not yet fully established. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in understanding the action of ERs/ligands, the therapeutic implications for CHD, and highlight the recent progress of both clinical and basic studies on the protection issue.

Methods determined whether several of these natural products and nutraceuticals, commonly taken for hormone-related effects, possess steroid hormone activity. The agonist and antagonist estrogenic, androgenic, and progestational activities of 20 natural products and nutraceuticals were assessed using an in vitro tissue culture indicator system. Two steroid-regulated proteins (pS2 and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) were quantified, using ELISA-type immunoassays, as markers of agonist and antagonist activity. Results: Four of the products tested, two isoflavone preparations, Promensil and Estro-Logic, chamomile, and grapeseed extracts, were found to have weak estrogenic agonist activity, with the latter two also demonstrating weak progestational activity. Several of the products tested exhibited antagonistic (blocking) activity, including antiestrogenic activity by Prostate-Ease, wild yam root, and dong quai, and antiandrogenic activity by dong quai, Promensil, and rosehips.

The present study was undertaken to examine potential estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities of D4 and HMDS. To address potential differences in sensitivity between rat strains the study used both Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Fischer 344 (F-344) rats. Estrogenicity of the test compounds was determined by measuring absolute and relative uterine weights in immature rats and by monitoring uterine epithelial cell height. In order to place the data obtained for D4 into perspective relative to strong and weak estrogenic compounds, the response produced by D4 at 0, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day was compared to responses produced by ethinyl estradiol (EE) (1, 3, 10, or 30 mug/kg/day), diethylstilbestrol dipropionate (DES-DP) (0.5, 1.5, 5, 15 mug/kg/day), and coumestrol (CE) (10, 35, 75, 150 mg/kg/day). Antiestrogenic effects were evaluated by co-administering D4 (500 mg/kg/day) with EE at 1, 3, 10, and 30 mug/kg/day. All compounds were administered in sesame oil at a volume of 5 mL/kg by oral gavage. Beginning on postnatal day 18 (SD) or 21 (F-344) each pup (12 per group) received a single dose of test compound once a day for 4 consecutive days. The pups were euthanized the morning after the last treatment and their uteri removed, weighed, and processed for histological examination. EE and DES-DP produced a significant dose-dependent increase in absolute and relative uterine weights and uterine cell height. The maximum increase in uterine weight following EE exposure was approximately 350% relative to controls in both strains. The weak phytoestrogen CE also produced a dose-related increase in absolute and relative uterine weight and epithelial cell height, but the response occurred over a much higher range of doses. At the highest dose of CE, uterine weight was increased approximately 230% relative to controls. Following exposure to D4, absolute and relative uterine weights and uterine epithelial cell height were statistically significantly increased in both strains of rats at doses above 100 mg/kg/day. In terms of uterine weight, D4 was approximately 0.6 million times less potent than EE or DES-DP in SD pups and 3.8 million times less potent than EE or DES-DP in F-344 pups. The maximal increase in uterine weight, relative to controls, produced by D4 at 1000 mg/kg/day was approximately 160% in SD rats, while the maximum increase produced by D4 in F-344 rats was 86%. D4 co-administered over a wide range of EE doses, resulted in a significant reduction in uterine weight compared to EE alone. HMDS was evaluated in SD rats only. The response produced by HMDS (600 and 1200 mg/kg/day) was compared to EE (3 mug/kg/day). Antiestrogenic effects were evaluated by co-administering HMDS (1200 mg/kg/day) with EE at 3 mug/kg/day. HMDS had no measurable effect on uterine weight under the experimental conditions described here. However, HMDS coadministered with EE did produce a small, but statistically significant reduction in uterine weight compared to EE alone. In conclusion, D4 showed weak estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity that was several orders of magnitude less potent than EE, and many times less potent than the weak phytoestrogen CE.",NA,"animal tissue article assay cell size comparative study concentration response consumer controlled study dose response endometrium epithelium cell estrogen activity euthanasia evaluation exposure female histopathology immaturity industry measurement monitoring nonhuman perinatal period rat rat strain statistical analysis uterus weight antiestrogen coumestrol/cm [Drug Comparison] coumestrol/do [Drug Dose] coumestrol/po [Oral Drug Administration] diethylstilbestrol derivative/cm [Drug Comparison] diethylstilbestrol derivative/do [Drug Dose] diethylstilbestrol derivative/po [Oral Drug Administration] diethylstilbestrol dipropionate/cm [Drug Comparison] diethylstilbestrol dipropionate/do [Drug Dose] diethylstilbestrol dipropionate/po [Oral Drug Administration] ethinylestradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] ethinylestradiol/do [Drug Dose] ethinylestradiol/po [Oral Drug Administration] *hexamethyldisiloxane/to [Drug Toxicity] *octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane/to [Drug Toxicity] phytoestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] phytoestrogen/do [Drug Dose] phytoestrogen/po [Oral Drug Administration] sesame seed oil *siloxane/to [Drug Toxicity] unclassified drug","37-46","63","2001",-1

Pouillart","Targeting HER2 in other tumor types","The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed/amplified in a range of tumor types including breast, ovarian, bladder, salivary gland, endometrial, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). HER2 is implicated in disease initiation and progression, associated with poor prognosis, and may also predict the response to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been designed to specifically antagonize the function of the HER2 receptor in HER2-positive tumors. Clinical phase II and III trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the humanized anti-HER2 MAb, trastuzumab (Herceptin), both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients. However, the prevalence of HER2 overexpression/amplification in various tumor types raises the possibility of using anti-HER2 MAbs to antagonize the abnormal function of overexpressed HER2 receptors in HER2-positive tumors other than breast.

"2445","2492"," R. Lieberman","Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer chemoprevention: Current status and future directions for agent development","Prostate cancer chemoprevention is defined as the administration of natural and synthetic agents that inhibit >1 steps in the natural history of prostate carcinogenesis. The goal is to find agents that modulate the progression from normal epithelium to dysplasia to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) to locally invasive cancer and systemic disease. Another important goal for chemoprevention is the maintenance of an androgen-sensitive clinical state and delay of the emergence of androgen independence. There is a strong rationale for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as a chemoprevention strategy for prostate cancer based on evidence from epidemiologic, experimental, molecular pathophysiologic, and randomized, controlled clinical trials. This includes the fact that HGPIN, the most likely precursor of invasive cancer, is androgen dependent and responds to ADT. Although the large, phase-3 Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) of finasteride versus placebo has established the feasibility and role of ADT for primary prevention, nevertheless, limitations of the anticipated treatment-effect size (eg, 25% reduction) and the potential for selection of androgen resistance provide incentive for finding other effective chemopreventive agents. The availability of novel noncytotoxic pharmaceutical and natural products in clinical development create opportunities for improving the therapeutic index through the principles of combination therapy. The emergence of new powerful tools, such as gene chip complementary DNA microarrays for multiplex gene expression profiling, will accelerate the identification of new molecular targets and the design of rational combinations. Several agent classes have a strong basis for combination with ADT, including antiproliferatives, antioxidant micronutrients (selenium), antiestrogens, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors).

No epidemiological study has evaluated the association of adolescent soyfood intake with the risk of breast cancer. To evaluate the effect of soyfood intake during adolescence, one of the periods that breast tissue is most sensitive to environmental stimuli, on subsequent risk of breast cancer, we analyzed data from a population-based case-control of 1459 breast cancer cases and 1556 age-matched controls (respective response rates were 91.1% and 90.3%). Information on dietary intake from ages 13-15 years was obtained by interview from all study participants and, in addition, from mothers of subjects less than 45 years of age (296 cases and 359 controls). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from unconditional logistic models were used to measure soyfood intake and breast cancer risk. After adjustment for a variety of other risk factors, adolescent soyfood intake was inversely associated with risk, with ORs of 1.0 (reference), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.60-0.93), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.55-0.87), 0.69 (95% CI, 0.55-0.86), and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.40-0.65), respectively, for the lowest to highest quintiles of total soyfood intake (trend test, P < 0.001). The inverse association was observed for each of the soyfoods examined and existed for both pre- and postmenopausal women. Adolescent soyfood intakes reported by participants' mothers were also inversely associated with breast cancer risk (P for trend < 0.001), with an OR of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.21-0.60) for women in the highest soyfood intake group.

The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project P-1 trial showed a 49% reduction in the early incidence of breast cancer, whereas the Royal Marsden trial and the Italian national trial showed no effect. These differences in results in the three trials could be accounted for by differences in the risk characteristics of the population of healthy women. Because of the short follow-up in the P-1 trial: clinical benefit, particularly survival, has not been established and further follow-up of the other trials including the UK/Australasian IBIS trial are required. Another selective antioestrogen (SERM), raloxifene, has been used in a clinical trial to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women with low bone mineral density. Annual mammography has shown an approximate 80% reduction in the early incidence of breast cancer and further follow-up of this trial continues.

The carcinogenic effect of prenatal exposure to diethyl-stilbestrol (DES) is the classic example. Because phytoestrogen use in nutritional and pharmaceutical applications for infants and children is increasing, we investigated the carcinogenic potential of genistein, a naturally occurring plant estrogen in soy, in an experimental animal model previously reported to result in a high incidence of uterine adenocarcinoma after neonatal DES exposure. Outbred female CD-1 mice were treated on days 1-5 with equivalent estrogenic doses of DES (0.001 mg/kg/day) or genistein (50 mg/kg/day). At 18 months, the incidence of uterine adenocarcinoma was 35% for genistein and 31% for DES. These data suggest that genistein is carcinogenic if exposure occurs during critical periods of differentiation.

The action of genistein on the uterus and vagina of ovariectomized DA/Han rats after 3 day oral administration (25, 50 or 100 mg/kg/BW/d) was compared to ethinyl oestradiol (0.1 mg/kg/BW/d). Effects on uterine and vaginal morphology, uterine growth and uterine gene expression were studied. A dose dependent increase of the uterine wet weight and the uterine and vaginal epithelial height, a dose dependent up-regulation of complement C3, down-regulation of clusterin mRNA expression and a stimulation of the vaginal cornification was observed after administration of genistein. Uterine gene expression and vaginal epithelium respond to genistein at doses where no significant effects on uterine wet weight were detectable. In general the vagina was more sensitive to genistein than the uterus. To analyse the action of genistein in malignant uterine tissue, the impact of a 28 d treatment with 50 mg/kg/d of genistein on the in-vivo tumour growth of RUCA I endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, following subcutaneous inoculation into syngeneic DA/Han rats, was assessed. In contrast to ethinyl oestradiol (0.1 mg/kg/BW/d), a dose of 50 mg/kg/BW/d of genistein did not affect tumour growth. Nevertheless C3 and TRPM2 mRNA expression in the tumour were both significantly stimulated by ethinyl oestradiol and genistein. In comparison to ovariectomized animals genistein up-regulated uterine wet weight and uterine dependent gene expression in tumour bearing animals.

In breast cancer survivors, most physicians avoid HRT because of concern regarding the potential promotion of growth of occult malignant cells by estrogens, due to the estrogen dependence of breast cancer. Soy phytoestrogens are being promoted as the 'natural alternative' to HRT and have been available without restrictions for several years as nutritional supplements. In this paper, data on the complex mammary effects of phytoestrogens in epidemiological studies, in in vitro studies, as well as in in vivo studies on animal carcinogenesis are reviewed. The potential benefits and risks of phytoestrogens are analyzed, and the prescription of phytoestrogens to postmenopausal women after breast cancer and the coprescription with the anti-estrogen tamoxifen are discussed. The absence of controlled trials and technical checking of extraction and titration in these preparations on 'free sale' raise a new problem in terms of public health and justify close reasoning and a cautious attitude of physicians, as well as straight information given to women, especially after breast cancer.",NA,"adjuvant chemotherapy *breast cancer cancer growth carcinogenesis conference paper estrogen deficiency hormone substitution human menopausal syndrome physician attitude risk benefit analysis treatment indication antiestrogen *phytoestrogen/dv [Drug Development] tamoxifen","129-134","8","2001",-1

Liu","The role of protein kinase B (PKB) in modulating heat sensitivity in a human breast cancer cell line","Purpose: Protein kinase B (PKB) is a critical mediator of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent survival signals in mammalian cells. Its activity is induced after heat shock, and is inhibited in cells undergoing apoptosis. We hypothesized that PKB may be an important modulator for heat-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells. Methods and Materials: MCF-7 cells were transfected using four different plasmids, encoding a kinase-dead mutant PKB-AAA, a constitutively activated mutant PKB-DD, wild-type PKB, and the neomycin-resistant selection gene. These stable transfectants were subjected to heat shock, and assessed for PKB phosphorylation, PKB activity, and likelihood of undergoing apoptosis. Results: After heating to 45degreeC x 30 mins, 25% of MCF-7/neo transfectants underwent apoptosis, which increased to 38% in the presence of wortmannin (WT), an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. In contrast, 23% of the constitutively activated MCF-7/DD transfectants underwent apoptosis, minimally affected by WT. Heat-induced apoptosis occurred in 34% of the kinase-dead MCF-7/AAA transfectants, which increased further to 58% with the addition of WT. This in turn was associated with a two-fold reduction in clonogenic survival compared to the MCF-7/neo transfectants. Conclusion: Heat shock activation of PKB in human MCF-7 cells appears to be a significant modulator of heat-induced apoptosis and survival. Further understanding of this important pathway may offer potential in developing novel strategies in cancer therapy.

The Bowman-Birk inhibitor is a soybean-derived protease inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic activities. METHODS. A Phase I trial of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate (BBIC) in 19 male subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has been performed. RESULTS. The results of the trial indicated that there was no dose-limiting toxicity of BBIC. There was a statistically significant decrease in serum PSA levels in all BBIC-treated patients. Some BBIC-treated patients exhibited a relatively large reduction in serum PSA levels, ranging up to a 43% reduction. There was also a statistically significant decrease in serum triglyceride levels and a decrease in prostate volume in the treated patients. The scores recorded in response to a urinary symptom questionnaire indicated improved urinary activities in the BBIC-treated patients; however, the control subjects exhibited similar improvements in urinary activities during the course of the trial. CONCLUSIONS. The data obtained in this trial, particularly the data suggesting that BBIC treatment may lead to reduced serum PSA levels and reduced prostate volumes, suggest that a Phase II clinical trial of BBIC for the therapy of BPH is warranted. 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"adult aged antigen detection article clinical trial controlled clinical trial controlled study drug safety human major clinical study male phase 1 clinical trial priority journal *prostate hypertrophy/dt [Drug Therapy] questionnaire randomized controlled trial scoring system soybean symptomatology treatment outcome triacylglycerol blood level urinary tract obstruction *Bowman Birk inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] *Bowman Birk inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] proteinase inhibitor/ct [Clinical Trial] proteinase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] triacylglycerol/ec [Endogenous Compound]","16-28","48","2001",-1

Polgar","Different effects of genistein on molecular markers related to apoptosis in two phenotypically dissimilar breast cancer cell lines","The association between consumption of genistein-containing soybean products and lower risk of breast cancer suggests a cancer chemopreventive role for genistein. Consistent with this suggestion, exposing cultured human breast cancer cells to genistein inhibits cell proliferation, although this is not completely understood. To better understand how genistein works, the ability of genistein to induce apoptosis was compared in phenotypically dissimilar MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells that express the wild-type and mutant p53 gene, respectively. After 6 days of incubation with 50 muM genistein, MCF-7 but not MDA-MB-231 cells, showed morphological signs of apoptosis. Marginal proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase and significant DNA fragmentation were also detected in MCF-7 cells. In elucidating these findings, it was determined that after 2 days of incubation with genistein, MCF-7 but not MDA-MB-231 cells, had significantly higher levels of p53. Accordingly, the expression of certain proteins modulated by p53 was studied next. Levels of p21 increased in both of the genistein-treated cell lines, suggesting that p21 gene expression was activated but in a p53-independent manner, whereas no significant changes in levels of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, were found. In MCF-7 cells, levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, decreased slightly at 18-24 h but then increased considerably after 48 h. Hence, the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio initially increased but later decreased. These data suggest that at the genistein concentration tested, MCF-7 cells in contrast to MDA-MB-231 cells were sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by genistein, but Bax and Bcl-2 did not play clear roles. 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,"advanced cancer article *breast cancer *cancer cell culture cancer growth cell proliferation chemical carcinogenesis drug effect gene expression regulation gene mutation growth inhibition human human cell phenotype priority journal protein degradation protein expression *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *protein p21 *protein p53","78-88","82","2001",-1

Results of epidemiological studies","The organochlorines, i.e. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and DDT, elicit estrogen responses in animals and in-vitro tests. Therefore, it was presumed that they may increase breast cancer in women, too. However, many epidemiological studies published in this field - and reported here - do not provide clear support for an association between organochlorine exposure and the occurrence of these cancers. These results are plausible, because both potency and concentration of these compounds are by several orders of magnitude lower than e.g. endogenious hormone levels. Compared to these environmental chemicals, phytoestrogens are food ingredients exhibiting a similarly low estrogen activity, but they may be taken up at much higher level, depending on individual eating habits.

"2487","2536"," L. E. Nachtigall","Isoflavones in the management of menopause","Menopause is characterised by a rapid and progressive reduction in oestradiol, the endogenous form of the steroid hormone oestrogen. This brings about many changes in a woman's body some of which, like hot flushes, are discomforting but not life-threatening. Others, like loss of bone density and decline in cardiovascular function, have serious life threatening consequences. Many of these changes can be eliminated or reduced with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Despite its benefits, however, some women are not candidates for this treatment and many others choose not to take it. As a result, there is growing interest among patients about natural alternatives to conventional HRT. There are a number of herbal and nutritional alternatives proposed for management of symptoms and reduction of health risks among menopausal women, and the group of phytoestrogens called isoflavones are promising compounds.

"2489","2539"," A. K. Singh","Development of QSAR models to predict estrogenic, carcinogeic, and cancer protective effects of phytoestrogens","An integrated QSAR model has been formulated to predict estrogenic, carcinogenic, and cancer protective effects of phytoestrogens (PE). Relative binding of PEs to estrogen receptors ERalpha and ERbeta exhibited a parabolic relationship with dipole moment (mu). The high-affinity binding of PEs to ERalpha correlated with Dif0(0chi-0chiv difference index encoding nonsigma electronic charge), while the low-affinity binding of PEs to ERalpha correlated with H bonding (positive coefficient) and % hydrophilic surface (negative coefficient). The high-affinity binding of PEs to ERbeta correlated with molecular with (MWd) and Dif0, while the low-affinity binding of PEs to ERbeta correlated with H bonding (positive coefficient) and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (negative coefficient). Thus an increase in electronic or ionic charge, formation of H bonds, or a decrease in hydrophilic property of PEs may increase their binding to ER. The relative transcription activity (RTA) of ERalpha correlated with Dif0-Dif1, while RTA of ERbeta correlated with H bonding and polarity. The PE-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis in estrogen-sensitive breast cancer (BC) cells correlated positively with {MD*4chiv} where MD is molecular depth and 4chiv is the valence of a 4th order fragment. IC50 for PE-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in estrogen-sensitive BC cells correlated with {MD* Log P} and Dif3 (3chi-3chiv difference index encoding nonsigma electronic charge of fragments consisting of four atoms and three bonds) and Diff23. IC50 for PE-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis in estrogen-independent cancer cell lines correlated with {MD* Log P) and 1/water solubility. Thus molecular shape and molecular connectivity of PEs play a key role in modulating estrogen-induced transactivation activity and DNA synthesis in BC cells.",NA,"article breast cancer cancer cell culture *carcinogenicity controlled study correlation function dipole DNA synthesis drug solubility electricity *estrogen activity human human cell hydrogen bond hydrophilicity IC 50 lipophilicity molecular biology priority journal quantitative structure activity relation receptor affinity receptor sensitivity transactivation estrogen receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/an [Drug Analysis] *phytoestrogen/pr [Pharmaceutics] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology]","201-216","19","2001",-1

However, when only present in the medium before the promotion period, Pal-BBI was effective in decreasing the transformation incidence (32.2%) while BBI was not (10.3%).

Design: In this double-blind 24-week study, 69 women were randomized to treatment: Isoflavone-rich soy protein (n=24), isoflavone-poor soy protein (n=24), or whey protein control (n=21). A Menopausal Index was used to assess change in hot flushes and night sweats, as well as other symptoms, at baseline, week 12, and week 24. Results: Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated no treatment effect on change in hot flush (p=0.18) and night sweat (p=0.92) frequency, whereas there was a significant decline in hot flush (p=0.0003) and night sweat (p=0.0007) frequency with time in all treatment groups. X2 analyses indicated no treatment effect on severity of hot flushes or night sweats at any time point, as well as no treatment effect on frequency or severity of other vasomotor symptoms. At the completion of the study, we found no treatment effect on retrospective perception of frequency, duration, or severity of hot flushes or night sweats. Since time had a significant effect on symptoms with all groups reporting a decline in overall symptoms, this indicated either a placebo effect or simply an improvement in symptoms during the study.

However, patients with multinodular goiter should not be treated or should be treated only under careful observation. When Lipiodol-induced thyrotoxicosis occurs it tends to be mild or even subclinical and self-limited. If treatment is required, potassium perchlorate with or without thionamides is recommended. Iodide goiter has not been seen after Lipiodol supplementation, nor has thyroiditis. Sialadenitis occurs rarely. Iodide derived from Lipiodol readily enters the fetus, possibly by active transport, and theoretically endangers the fetus because autoregulation of the fetal thyroid occurs late during gestation. Despite the difficulty in distinguishing iodide goiter from iodide deficiency goiter of the newborn, no cases of neonatal iodide goiter have been reported. Possible mechanisms of thyroid inhibition by excess iodide are briefly discussed.

Materials and Methods: A total of 34 men supplemented their diet by consuming 1 of 2 soy protein beverages assigned randomly twice daily for a 6-week period. In a second 6-week period they consumed the other soy protein beverage. The beverage ISP+ provided 42 mg. of genistein and 27 mg. of daidzein daily, whereas the other beverage, ISP-, provided only 2.1 and 1.3 mg. of these isoflavones daily, respectively.

In a first experiment, animals were either sham-operated (SH; n = 5), or ovariectomized (OVX; n = 20) and orally treated for three months with either genistein (G; n = 5; 10 mug/g BW/d) or daidzein (D; n = 5; 10 mug/g BW/d) or 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (E; n = 5; 23 mug/kg BW/d) or untreated (OVX; n = 5). At necropsy, the basal uterine tension was lower in OVX, G and D than in SH, the highest value being measured in E. Oxytocin (10-12; 10-11 M) or PGF2alpha (10-12; 10-9 M) induced an increase in SH, but not in OVX, E and G. In D, only the highest doses were efficient. In a second experiment, 20 intact animals were s.c. injected with either genistein (G; n = 5; 10 mug/g BW) or daidzein (D; n = 5; 10 mug/g BW) or estradiol benzoate (E; n = 5; 23 mug/kg BW) or vehicle (C: controls; n = 5), and killed 24 h later. In C and E, OT (10-15 to 10-10 M) or L (10-12 to 10-7 M) stimulated uterine contractile activity in a dose-dependent manner until a maximal level. On the opposite, in G and D, contractile agents (except the highest luprostiol doses) did not stimulate myometrium contractions. Moreover, radioligand binding assays showed that genistein or daidzein inhibited the specific binding of [3H] estradiol to the calf uterus estrogen receptor (ER). Therefore, it could be postulated that both genistein and daidzein might bind to the rat uterus ER, inducing either anti-estrogenic or very weak estrogenic effects (depending on the experimental conditions) on in vitro uterine responsiveness to OT and PGF2alpha or luprostiol. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.",NA,"animal tissue article autopsy comparative study controlled study dose response female intrauterine pressure myometrium nonhuman ovariectomy rat receptor affinity receptor occupancy *uterus contractility *daidzein/cm [Drug Comparison] *daidzein/do [Drug Dose] *daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol ethinylestradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] ethinylestradiol/do [Drug Dose] ethinylestradiol/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/do [Drug Dose] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] luprostiol oxytocin","201-208","75","2000",-1

Walker","Influence of exogenous estrogen receptor ligands on uterine leiomyoma: Evidence from an in vitro/in vivo animal model for uterine fibroids","The remarkable frequency of uterine leiomyoma in the human population calls into question the potential for the participation of environmental factors in tumor etiology. Having been implicated in the dramatic rise in hormone-related cancers in recent years, endocrine disruptors are salient suspects in this pathogenesis, although the mechanism by which they might participate is unclear. Investigations using the Eker rat model show that uterine leiomyoma may have an enhanced sensitivity to modulation via the estrogen receptor.

Genistein has been implicated in anticancer activities, including differentiation, apoptosis, inhibition of cell growth and inhibition of angio-genesis. In previous studies, genistein was shown to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M in several cancer cell lines in vitro, which is associated with induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1), a universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. At present, the molecular basis for diverse genistein-mediated cellular responses is largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether galectin-3, an anti-apoptotic gene product, regulates genistein-mediated cellular responses. We show that genistein effectively induces apoptosis without detectable cell cycle arrest in BT549, a human breast epithelial cell line which does not express galectin-3 at a detectable level. In galectin-3 transfected BT549 cells, genistein induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase without apoptosis induction. Interestingly, genistein induces p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression in galectin-3-expressing BT549 cells, but not in control BT549 cells undergoing apoptosis. Collectively, the results of the present study suggest that galectin-3, at least in part, is a critical determinant for genistein-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and genistein induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) is associated with cell cycle arrest, but not required for apoptosis induction.",NA,"angiogenesis antineoplastic activity *apoptosis article breast cancer breast epithelium cancer cell culture cancer inhibition cancer prevention *cell cycle G2 phase cell differentiation cell proliferation cell protection controlled study genetic transfection growth inhibition human human cell nutritional value priority journal protein expression protein induction soybean 4 [5 (4 methyl 1 piperazinyl)[2,5' bi 1h benzimidazol] 2' yl]phenol antineoplastic agent/ec [Endogenous Compound] beta actin/ec [Endogenous Compound] caspase cyclin D1/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclin dependent kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *galectin 3/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] monoclonal antibody penicillin G polyclonal antibody protein p21/ec [Endogenous Compound] streptomycin","1941-1945","21","2000",-1

Daidzein, an inactive analog of genistein, was without effects. Tyrosine phosphatase inhibition by orthovanadate increased cytosolic Ca2+. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis revealed that 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 rapidly (0.5-10 min) stimulates in a concentrationdependent fashion (0.1-10 nM) tyrosine phosphorylation of several myoblast proteins, among which the major targets of the hormone could be immunochemically identified as phospholipase C (127 kDa), which mediates intracellular store Ca2+ mobilization and external Ca2+ influx, and the growth-related proteins mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (42/44 kDa) and c-myc (65 kDa). Genistein suppressed the increase in phosphorylation and concomitant elevation of MAPK activity elicited by the sterol. Both genistein and the MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 abolished stimulation of DNA synthesis by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3. The sterol-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of c-myc, a finding not reported before for cell growth regulators, was totally suppressed by the specific Src inhibitor PP1.

Previously, we have utilized MCF-7 human breast cancer cells deprived of estradiol long term (LTED cells) as the model system to study the regrowth phenomenon and have demonstrated that these cells exhibited increased cell proliferation rate and increased ER functionality during the adaptive processes. In this report, we examined the hypothesis that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signal was involved. We found that activated MAP kinase was elevated in LTED cells and that the MAP kinase specific inhibitor PD98059 was able to inhibit the elevated MAP kinase and [3H]thymidine uptake in LTED cells, suggesting mediation of DNA synthesis and proliferation by the MAP kinase pathway. Other MAP kinase upstream inhibitors, including genestein, RG13022, and mevastatin were also able to inhibit the [3H]thymidine uptake in LTED cells. Interestingly, the antiestrogen, ICI 182,780 was able to block the activated MAP kinase in LTED cells. Treatment with PD98059 did not block elevated basal ERE-CAT activity while at the same time inhibiting [3H]thymidine uptake in LTED cells. Furthermore, treatment with PD98059 partially blocked the E2-stimulated ERE-CAT activity and [3H]thymidine uptake in both LTED and in wild type cells, indicating that both MAP kinase-dependent and MAP kinase-independent pathways are involved in the transactivation function of ER.

This estrogen deprivation is probably associated with a number of consequences, including osteoporosis, tooth loss, cardiovascular disease, stroke, age-related macular degeneration colon cancer, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinsons's disease. Coronary artery disease is the most frequent cause of death in women age 50 years and older, yet most women report a fear of dying from breast cancer. Current data suggest that women who take some form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause can reduce their cardiovascular mortality approximately 50%, yet many stop taking HRT - or never start - because of this fear. Although use of estrogen replacement therapy and HRT (after a diagnosis of breast cancer) currently is contraindicated for at least 5 years by the US Food and Drug Administration, 3 studies have found that women who took hormones had no greater incidence of breast cancer recurrence than the general breast cancer population. Evidence suggest HRT has a beneficial effect on the central nervous system, including on neurotransmitter systems within the brain that are implicated in mood disorders and depression; learning, memory, and Alzheimer's disease; and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. When women are counseled about the benefits and risks of HRT and alternative therapies, it may help for physicians to keep in mind that women are more than a sum of their estrogen receptors: their emotions and beliefs will influence how they view menopause and their receptivity to available therapeutic options.",NA,"Alzheimer disease/dm [Disease Management] bone metabolism breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] breast cancer/pc [Prevention] cancer recurrence cardiovascular disease/dt [Drug Therapy] cardiovascular disease/ep [Epidemiology] cardiovascular disease/pc [Prevention] central nervous system clinical trial conference paper depression diabetes mellitus dyskinesia/si [Side Effect] *estrogen deficiency/dt [Drug Therapy] female health care cost *hormone substitution human menopause/dt [Drug Therapy] population risk priority journal treatment outcome acetylsalicylic acid/cb [Drug Combination] acetylsalicylic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] alendronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] antilipemic agent/cb [Drug Combination] antilipemic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] antioxidant/cb [Drug Combination] antioxidant/dt [Drug Therapy] beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent/cb [Drug Combination] beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent/dt [Drug Therapy] bisphosphonic acid derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] calcitonin/dt [Drug Therapy] calcium channel blocking agent/cb [Drug Combination] calcium channel blocking agent/dt [Drug Therapy] conjugated estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate/dt [Drug Therapy] dhes/cm [Drug Comparison] dhes/dt [Drug Therapy] dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] diuretic agent/cb [Drug Combination] diuretic agent/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/cb [Drug Combination] estradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] estradiol/dt [Drug Therapy] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] *estrogen/ct [Clinical Trial] *estrogen/cb [Drug Combination] *estrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] *estrogen/pd [Pharmacology] etidronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] fluoxetine/dt [Drug Therapy] gestagen/cb [Drug Combination] gestagen/dt [Drug Therapy] levodopa/ae [Adverse Drug Reaction] levodopa/it [Drug Interaction] levodopa/dt [Drug Therapy] levodopa/pk [Pharmacokinetics] phytoestrogen/cb [Drug Combination] phytoestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] probucol/cm [Drug Comparison] probucol/dt [Drug Therapy] quercetin/cm [Drug Comparison] quercetin/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] resveratrol/cm [Drug Comparison] resveratrol/dt [Drug Therapy] retinol/cm [Drug Comparison] retinol/dt [Drug Therapy] risedronic acid/dt [Drug Therapy] selective estrogen receptor modulator/dt [Drug Therapy] soybean protein/cb [Drug Combination] soybean protein/dt [Drug Therapy] soybean protein/pd [Pharmacology] statin/cb [Drug Combination] statin/dt [Drug Therapy] tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] unclassified drug unindexed drug","S746-S760","6","2000",-1

In contrast, expression of activated Galpha(S) or Galpha(i2) had no effect on Kv1.5 mRNA expression. Furthermore, pertussis and cholera toxins failed to block the TRH-induced decrease in channel mRNA. Surprisingly, despite the role of Gq, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 did not alter down-regulation of channel mRNA by TRH, although it abolished the TRH-induced increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and up-regulation of c-fos mRNA. Furthermore, depletion of an intracellular Ca2+ pool or inhibition of protein kinase C did not block the TRH-induced decrease in Kv1.5 mRNA.

These compounds were tested on BT-474 human breast cancer cells at concentrations of 108-10-5 M, with estradiol (estrogen), norgestrel (progestin) and dihydrotestosterone (androgen) used as positive controls, and ethanol (solvent) as a negative control. pS2, an estrogen-regulated protein, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), regulated by androgens and progestins, were quantified in tissue culture supernatants using ELISA-type immunofluorometric assays developed in-house. Of the 72 compounds tested, 18 showed estrogenic activity at 10-5 M. Of this subset, seven also showed progestational activity at this concentration. The soy isoflavones, biochanin A and genistein, showed the most potent estrogenic activity, with a dose-response effect up to 10-7 M. Of all other flavonoids, luteolin and naringenin displayed the strongest estrogenicity, while apigenin had a relatively strong progestational activity.

Previous studies on rodents have suggested that catecholamines stimulate proliferation of the intestinal epithelium through activation of alpha2 adrenoceptors located on crypt cells. The occurrence of this effect awaits demonstration in humans and the molecular mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated. Here, we examined the effect of alpha2 agonists on a clone of Caco2 cells expressing the human alpha(2A) adrenoceptor. Methods. Cells were transfected with a bicistronic plasmid containing the alpha2C10 and neomycin phosphotransferase genes. G418 resistant clones were assayed for receptor expression using radioligand binding. Receptor functionality was assessed by testing its ability to couple Gi proteins and to inhibit cAMP production. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was followed by western blot, and cell proliferation was estimated by measuring protein and DNA content. Results. Permanent transfection of Caco2 cells allowed us to obtain a clone (Caco2-3B) expressing alpha(2A) adrenoceptors at a density similar to that found in normal human intestinal epithelium. Caco2-3B retained morphological features and brush border enzyme expression characteristic of enterocytic differentiation. The receptor was coupled to Gi2/Gi3 proteins and its stimulation caused marked diminution of forskolin induced cAMP production. Treatment of Caco2-3B with UK14304 (alpha2 agonist) induced a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of MAPK, extracellular regulated protein kinase 1 (Erkl), and 2 (Erk2). This event was totally abolished in pertussis toxin treated cells and in the presence of kinase inhibitors (genistein or PD98059). It was unaffected by protein kinase C downregulation but correlated with a transient increase in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, sustained exposure of Caco2-3B to UK14304 resulted in modest but significant acceleration of cell proliferation. None of these effects was observed in the parental cell line Caco2.

Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) stimulates intestinal epithelial growth with high potency and specificity. However, the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for the growth-stimulatory action of GLP-2 are not clearly understood. Here we report possible signaling pathways mediating GLP-2's proliferative actions in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2. Materials and methods. Caco-2 cells were subcultured under serum-deprived conditions in the presence or absence of GLP-2 (10 muM) and varying concentrations of inhibitors of three candidate kinases: genistein, a global tyrosine kinase inhibitor; LY294002, a phosphatidylinositide (PI) 3-kinase inhibitor; and PD 098059, a mitogen- activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Proliferation was assessed using [3H]thymidine incorporation. Relative abundance of the phosphorylated forms of two specific mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK1 and ERK2, was assessed by Western blotting. Results. GLP-2-treated cells demonstrated a greater than 10-fold increase in proliferation. This response was inhibited by genistein, LY294002, and PD 098059 in a dose-dependent fashion. A significantly greater abundance of the phosphorylated forms of both ERK-1 and ERK-2 was present in cells within 5 rain of treatment with GLP-2. Conclusions. GLP-2 stimulates the proliferation of Caco-2 cells in vitro. This increase in Caco-2 proliferation in response to GLP-2 may be due, at least in part, to the involvement of both the PI 3- kinase and the MAPK pathways.

Cooke","Phytoestrogens and cardiovascular health","Coronary artery disease is the leading overall cause of mortality for women and increases dramatically after menopause. Estrogen has many beneficial cardiovascular actions although concerns have been raised about its effects on the progression of breast and uterine neoplasms and its tendency to increase coagulability. Selective estrogen agonists may be superior to conventional estrogens. A dietary source of a partial estrogen agonist is the plant-based group of phytoestrogens, which include isoflavones, lignans and coumestans. Phytoestrogens have a similar structure to estradiol and have weak affinity for the estrogen receptor. Epidemiologic data indicate that women ingesting high amounts of phytoestrogens, particularly as isoflavones in soy products, have less cardiovascular disease, breast and uterine cancer and menopausal symptoms than those eating Western diets. Preclinical and clinical studies have found that isoflavones have lipid-lowering effects as well as the ability to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation. They have been shown to normalize vascular reactivity in estrogen-deprived primates. Furthermore, phytoestrogens have antineoplastic effects with inhibition of cellular proliferation as well as angiogenesis, properties that could be protective against cancer development. Finally, menopausal symptoms and bone density may be favorably influenced by phytoestrogens. In summary, phytoestrogens, in the form of dietary isoflavones, represent a new area to explore in pursuit of nutritional approaches to cardiovascular protection.

Tissue was harvested for analysis of cystic change, cell proliferation, macrophage infiltration, and fibrosis. Renal and hepatic tissues were also harvested for lipid analysis using gas chromatography. Results. Animals thrived on both diets. Soy protein feeding was associated with reduced cystic change (4.3 vs. 7.0 mL/kg, P < 0.0001), epithelial cell proliferation (15.7 vs. 21.0 cells/mm epithelium, P < 0.0001), macrophage infiltration (25.3 vs. 43.5 cells/high-power field, P < 0.0001), and fibrosis (0.6 vs. 1.07 mL/kg, P < 0.0001). The soy diet prevented a significant elevation in serum creatinine in diseased versus normal animals. Soy feeding was associated with higher renal and hepatic linoleic acid content and higher hepatic alpha-linolenic acid, but lower hepatic arachidonic acid content. Conclusions. Isocaloric soy protein feeding ameliorates both epithelial and interstitial changes in the Han:SPRD-cy rat independent of a hypocholesterolemic effect. The histologic benefit is associated with changes in polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism that may influence both inflammatory and proliferative pathways.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue antiinflammatory activity antineoplastic activity article controlled study creatinine blood level fatty acid metabolism hypocholesterolemia interstitial nephritis kidney injury *kidney polycystic disease lipid analysis nonhuman nutritional deficiency priority journal *protein diet rat *arachidonic acid *creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound] *linoleic acid *linolenic acid *polyunsaturated fatty acid *soybean protein","159-166","57","2000",-1

Tashjian Jr","Novel action of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide: Stimulation of extracellular acidification in rat pituitary GH4C1 cells","Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a member of the vasoactive intestinal peptide/secretin family. Using microphysiometry, we have found that PACAP acutely (1 min) increased the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in GH4C1 cells approximately 40% above basal in a concentration-dependent manner. ECAR, maximally induced by PACAP, can be increased further by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), indicating that the signalling pathways for these two neuropeptides are not identical. In studies on the mechanism of PACAP-enhanced ECAR, we found that maximum stimulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by treatment with FSK, or the PKC pathway with PMA, did not inhibit the ECAR response to PACAP. The PKC inhibitor calphostin C and the MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on the ECAR response to PACAP. Furthermore, PACAP induced little or no change in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)), while TRH induced a large increase in [Ca2+](i). However, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein completely blocked PACAP-induced ECAR, suggesting involvement of tyrosine kinase(s). We conclude that PACAP causes an increase in ECAR in GH4C1 rat pituitary cells, which is not dependent on the PKA, PKC, MAP kinase or Ca2+ signalling pathways, but does require tyrosine kinase activity.

Grantham","cAMP stimulates the in vitro proliferation of renal cyst epithelial cells by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway","Background. Cellular proliferation is a key factor in the enlargement of renal cysts in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We determined the extent to which adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) may regulate the in vitro proliferation of cyst epithelial cells derived from human ADPKD cysts. Methods. Epithelial cells from cysts of individuals with ADPKD and from normal human kidney cortex (HKC) of individuals without ADPKD were cultured. The effects of agonists and inhibitors on the rate of cellular proliferation and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK(1/2)) were determined. Results. 8-Br-cAMP (100 mumol/L) stimulated the proliferation of cells from eight different ADPKD subjects to 99.0% above baseline; proliferation was inhibited by protein kinase A (PKA) antagonists H-89 (97%) and Rp-cAMP (90%). Forskolin (10 mumol/L), which activates adenylyl cyclase, increased proliferation 124%, and receptor-mediated agonists arginine vasopressin, desmopressin, secretin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and prostaglandin E2 stimulated proliferation 54.2, 56.3, 46.7, 37.1, and 48.3%, respectively. The mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 completely inhibited ADPKD cell proliferation in response to cAMP agonists, but genistein, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, did not block cAMP-dependent proliferation. cAMP agonists increased the activity of ERK above control levels within five minutes. In contrast to ADPKD, proliferation and ERK activity of cells derived from normal HKC were not stimulated by cAMP agonists, although electrogenic Cl- secretion was increased by these agonists in both ADPKD and HKC cell monolayers. Conclusions. We conclude that cAMP agonists stimulate the proliferation of ADPKD but not HKC epithelial cells through PKA activation of the ERK pathway at a locus distal to receptor tyrosine kinase. We suggest that the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway may have a unique role in determining the rate of cyst enlargement in ADPKD through in actions to stimulate cellular proliferation and transepithelial solute and fluid secretion.",NA,"cell proliferation chloride transport conference paper controlled study enzyme activation enzyme activity human human cell in vitro study kidney cortex kidney epithelium *kidney polycystic disease/cn [Congenital Disorder] *kidney polycystic disease/et [Etiology] priority journal Western blotting 2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone 8 bromo cyclic AMP adenylate cyclase/ec [Endogenous Compound] argipressin *cyclic AMP/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] desmopressin forskolin genistein *mitogen activated protein kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] n [2 (4 bromocinnamylamino)ethyl] 5 isoquinolinesulfonamide prostaglandin E2 protein tyrosine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] secretin vasoactive intestinal polypeptide","1460-1471","57","2000",-1

DNA damage was evaluated using the comet assay. Apoptosis was determined by the ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining technique. DNA breakage was noted within 1 h of treatment. Apoptosis was only induced with high concentrations (>60 muM) of genistein. Marked inhibition of HT-29 cell growth was evident at concentrations ranging from 60 to 150 muM. This was associated with a cell cycle arrest at G2/M. Similar findings were obtained in SW-620 and SW-1116 colon cancer cell lines. Aclarubicin, a topo II antagonist, reduced genistein-induced DNA breaks but did not reduce apoptosis.

Fractures resulting from the decrease in bone mass which characterises this disease are very costly in both financial and human terms. It has been known for many years that oestrogen treatment, or hormone replacement therapy (HRT), prevents bone loss and osteoporosis. However, many women do not tolerate the numerous side effects, or are concerned by the possibility of increased rate of breast cancer. Calcitonin has also been used for some years to treat osteoporosis, in spite of the drawbacks associated with a protein therapeutic. Since 1996, alendronate, a member of the bisphosphonate class of antiresorptive agents, has been available for the treatment and, subsequently, the prevention of osteoporosis. Despite a difficult dosing regimen and gastrointestinal side effects, alendronate is widely prescribed. The more recent introduction of a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, raloxifene, provides an additional option for both prevention and treatment of the disease. However, there remains a need for highly efficacious antiresorptive agents with an excellent safety and tolerability profile. In addition, there are no bone-forming agents currently available, which are needed to treat patients with very low bone mass who are at high risk of fracture. There are currently numerous agents in clinical development in the classes mentioned above. In addition, there are many novel approaches to the modulation of bone resorption and formation in the discovery and/or early development phases. These include inhibitors of osteoclast adhesion, protease and kinase inhibitors, and receptor antagonists as well as some protein agents.

In this study, we investigated whether dietary intervention could inhibit tumor growth of an androgen-sensitive human prostatic cancer. METHODS. LNCaP cells were transplanted subcutaneously in nude-mice. The animals were then put on different diets and tumor take, tumor growth and prostate specific antigen (PSA) secretion were studied during 9 weeks. RESULTS. Palpable tumors developed in 75% of the tumor-cell injected sites in animals fed a control diet (corn starch, sucrose, etc.) whereas, for animals given rye bran (RE), ethyl acetate extraction from rye bran supplemented cellulose based diets (CCEE), palpable tumors were seen in only 30% and for soy protein based diets (SCC) 50% of the transplantation sites, respectively. The tumors that grew to palpable size in the rye (RE) and soy (SCC) groups were smaller and secreted less PSA than those in the control group. In the rye and soy groups tumor cell apoptosis was increased, but cell proliferation was unaffected. Addition of fat to the rye diet reduced its effect on prostate cancer growth. CONCLUSIONS. Factors in rye bran and soy protein may inhibit prostate cancer growth. The effect is more apparent for rye than for soy.

We previously reported that ET-1 exerted part (50%) of its effect via protein kinase C (PKC) activation. We now show that in addition to ET-1 and 4beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), pervanadate also stimulated PLD activity. Stimulation by pervanadate was not affected by the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 but was abolished by protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors genistein and tyrphostin-47. Genistein partially reduced (52%) ET-1 stimulation, which was further attenuated (96%) by Ro-31-8220, indicating that PTKs may account for the PKC-independent arm of ET-1-stimulated PLD activity. Cell-permeable ceramides reduced (50%) the activation of PLD by ET-1 and PDBu but not that by pervanadate. Inhibition was also achieved by sphingomyelinase but not with sphingosine. Inhibition by genistein and D- erythro-N-hexanoyl-sphingosine was additive, whereas inhibition by Ro-31-8220 and D-erythro-N-hexanoyl-sphingosine was not, indicating that ceramide affected the PKC-dependent process involved in PLD activation by ET-1. Forskolin, as well as dibutyryl-cAMP and iloprost, attenuated (50%) the activation of PLD by ET-1 and pervanadate but not that by PDBu. Inhibition by forskolin was prevented by H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A. Inhibition by forskolin and ceramide was additive, whereas inhibition by genistein and forskolin was not, indicating that the cAMP/protein kinase A cascade affected the PTK-dependent process involved in PLD activation by ET-1.

Soybean and rapeseed oils are currently the most plentiful liquid vegetable oils and both have desirable ratios of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids. However, soybean and rapeseed oils are commonly partially hydrogenated for use in commercial frying to decrease susceptibility to oxidative degradation. This process leads to selective losses of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Intake of linoleic acid (18:2n-6) has risen in many northern European countries. In the United Kingdom, intakes have increased from 10 g/d in the late 1970s to 15 g/d in the 1990s. The intake of alpha-linolenic acid is estimated to be 1-2 g/d but varies with the type of culinary oil used. There are few reliable estimates of the intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, but those are generally 0.1-0.5 g/d. The increased use of intensive, cereal-based livestock production systems has resulted in a lower proportion of n-3 fatty acids in meat compared with traditional extensive production systems. Overall, there has been a shift in the balance between n-6 and n-3 fatty acids over the past 30 y. This shift is reflected in the declining concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid and rising concentrations of linoleic acid in breast milk.",NA,"breast milk cereal conference paper dietary intake Europe *fat intake food chain food composition human meat docosahexaenoic acid fish oil linoleic acid linolenic acid omega 3 fatty acid palm oil *polyunsaturated fatty acid rapeseed oil soybean oil sunflower oil","176S-178S","71","2000",-1
"2579","2664"," R. Nikolov, W. H.

NAMS was originally founded through the efforts of W.H. Utian and was incorporated as a nonprofit scientific organization in November 1988. The main topics of the meeting included prevention of cardiovascular disease; menopause and diabetes; sexual function in menopausal women; menopause and osteoporosis; arthritis and related disorders in menopausal women; and strategies to reduce the risk of breast cancer. The nonprescription and pharmacologic approaches emphasized were lifestyle measures, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), estrogen-progestogen hormone replacement therapy (HRT), phytoestrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). ERT and HRT might play a significant role in the management of disorders associated with aging, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, mood impairments, Alzheimer's disease, urogenital atrophy, and sexual and urinary dysfunctions. Different estrogen-progestogen regimens have been investigated. New routes of administration of 17beta-estradiol (intranasal and inhalatory) have also been studied. SERMs might have a significant role in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Summarized results from more than 37,000 women with early stages of breast cancer confirm the ability of tamoxifen to improve survival. In women with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, tamoxifen was reported to reduce the risk by 50%. Recent results on the effect of raloxifene on osteoporosis and breast cancer risk are very promising.

"2581","2665"," V. L. Baker, U. Ulrich, R. N. Taylor","Estrogen Replacement and Alternatives for the Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis","The adult human skeleton is subject to constant breakdown and synthesis, a phenomenon referred to as bone remodeling. After menopause, bone resorption may exceed bone formation. As a result, osteoporosis may develop - a disease that is characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Bone densitometry is often used as a noninvasive means of diagnosing osteoporosis before fracture. The definition of osteoporosis, published in 1994 by the World Health Organization Osteoporosis Study Group, states that osteoporosis is present when the bone mineral density (BMD) is more than 2.5 SDs below the young adult mean. An assessment of BMD may often help the clinician and a woman decide whether to initiate therapy for osteoporosis prevention or to begin treatment. The National Osteoporosis Foundation currently recommends measuring BMD in any woman aged 65 years or over who is not already on treatment. Bone markers may have a role in the management of women with osteopenia or osteoporosis, but the high variability in the results from bone marker testing limits their value and must be considered when interpreting the results. The most widely used options for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, including estrogen, calcium, calcitonin, the bisphosphonates, and the selective estrogen receptor modulators, act primarily by inhibiting bone resorption. In this way, BMD may be increased by any of these therapies. An interesting finding from studies of hormone replacement, alendronate, tamoxifen, and raloxifene is that the magnitude of fracture prevention is greater than would be predicted from the changes in BMD. It is possible that bone quality may also be influenced by some of these therapies. There is controversy regarding the appropriate time to initiate therapy; some argue for initiation of therapy early for prevention of osteopenia, whereas others argue that the most important time to initiate therapy is later (after the diagnosis of osteopenia or osteoporosis). If all women, including women with normal BMD, are treated to prevent osteopenia, then many women will need to be treated to prevent a fracture. If therapy is not initiated until a fracture occurs, subsequent fracture risk will be reduced, compared with the risk present if no therapy is given. However, the risk of fracture may still be high, even with treatment, because of marked deterioration of bone architecture in women with fractures that may not be correctable with treatment at the advanced stage of disease. Thus, a reasonable strategy may be to treat women who have osteopenia or osteoporosis and to provide calcium supplementation and to follow up women with normal BMD. However, for therapies such as estrogen replacement, which affects tissues other than the bone, it may be desirable to initiate therapy in women with normal BMD to achieve benefits for other organ systems. Decisions regarding which therapy is most appropriate for an individual woman must take into account the impact of each therapeutic agent on a woman's total health. For example, a woman with osteoporosis and at high risk of breast cancer may prefer to take alendronate rather than hormone replacement. If long-term prevention of breast cancer is confirmed with selective estrogen receptor modulators such as raloxifene, this medication may prove to be the therapy of choice for such a patient. Hormone replacement would be preferable to other treatments for a woman with osteoporosis and symptomatic genital atrophy. Adequate calcium intake and exercise are important for all women.

The international differences in cancer incidence are largely accounted for by lifestyle practices that include nutrition, exercise, and alcohol and tobacco use. About 50% of cancer incidence and 35% of cancer mortality in the U.S., represented by cancers of the breast, prostate, pancreas, ovary, endometrium, and colon, are associated with Western dietary habits. Cancer of the stomach, currently a major disease in the Far East, relates to distinct, specific nutritional elements such as excessive salt intake. For these cancers, information is available on possible initiating genotoxic factors, promoting elements, and prophylactic agents. In general, the typical diet in the United States contains low levels of the potent carcinogenic agents, heterocyclic amines, formed during the cooking of meats. It provides only about half the potent appropriate fiber intake and is high in calories. About twice as many calories as would be desirable come from fat, certain kinds of which enhance the development of cancers. Other foods with functional properties, such as soy products and tea, can be beneficial. To achieve reduction in risk of certain cancers, diet must be optimized, primarily to reduce caloric intake and the fat component. The latter should be 20% or less of total caloric intake and fiber should be increased to 25-35 g per day for adults. One approach to achieving these goals is the Fiber First Diet, a diet designed around adequate fiber intake from grains, especially cereals, vegetables, legumes, and fruits, which thereby reduces both calorie and fat intake. Such dietary improvements will not only reduce cancer and other chronic disease risks, but will contribute to a healthy life to an advanced age.

We also determined the contribution of these and other factors to the variability of each sex hormone.

Pedraza","Phyto and mycoestrogens (xenoestrogens) as a preventable cause of breast cancer","Xenoestrogens are defined as exogenous substances that mimic the action of estrogens. They may have a role in the dietary etiology of human diseases and account for some fraction of unexplained cases of breast cancer. Animal and epidemiological studies have pointed out a chemopreventive action on mammary carcinogenesis by a particular group of foreign estrogens; these include phytoestrogens, a class of naturally occurring plant components that humans consume daily. Phytoestrogens have several anticarcinogenic biological activities that could account for their role in the etiology of breast cancer. Phytoestrogens are believed to exert their action by interacting with the estrogen receptor (alpha and beta forms), either triggering a specific response (agonist effect) or blocking the binding of stronger endogenous estrogens (antagonist effect). Other effects on protein synthesis, growth factor actions, malignant cell proliferation, angiogenesis, calcium transport, vascular smooth muscle cells, lipid oxidation and cell differentiation may also explain a protective role for phytoestrogens in breast cancer. The rise in breast cancer incidence has been related to the Western life-style. Dietary intakes of energy, fat, meat, milk, fish, fiber and fresh vegetables have been evaluated as contributing factors. Epidemiological investigations have related the urinary excretion of phytoestrogens to the incidence of breast cancer. In Asian countries the vegetarian diet seems to contribute to a low incidence of breast cancer. Thus, a role for phytoestrogens in the prevention of breast cancer is plausible.",NA,"angiogenesis article *breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *breast cancer/et [Etiology] *breast cancer/pc [Prevention] breast carcinogenesis/ep [Epidemiology] breast carcinogenesis/et [Etiology] breast carcinogenesis/pc [Prevention] calcium transport cancer incidence cancer prevention cell differentiation cell proliferation diet fungus human lipid oxidation protein synthesis urinary excretion vascular smooth muscle calcium ion/ec [Endogenous Compound] carcinogen/to [Drug Toxicity] *estrogen/dv [Drug Development] *estrogen/to [Drug Toxicity] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] growth factor/ec [Endogenous Compound] lipid/ec [Endogenous Compound] *phytoestrogen/dv [Drug Development] *phytoestrogen/to [Drug Toxicity] protein/ec [Endogenous Compound] *xenobiotic agent/to [Drug Toxicity]","55-60","27","1999",-1

Bowman Birk inhibitor (BBI) is an anticarcinogenic serine protease inhibitor that may inhibit the protease activity of prostate- specific antigen (PSA) and the growth of human prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. METHODS. Human prostate cancer xenografts were established by implanting LNCaP cells into the prostate glands of NCRNU-M athymic nude mice. The animals with established tumors were maintained on a control diet or diets supplemented with 1% BBI or 1%, 2%, or 3% BBI concentrate (BBIC) for 6 weeks. The serum PSA concentrations were determined before and after the BBI or BBIC treatment period. The final tumor loads were determined at autopsy. RESULTS. Treatment with BBI or BBIC decreased the final tumor load and increased the tumor doubling time and PSA density in the nude mice bearing human prostate cancer xenografts. CONCLUSIONS.

The first group was fed coumestrol in lab chow (200 mug of coumestrol per day) for 14 days; the second group received coumestrol (40 mg/L) via perfusion medium. There was a significant increase (78% compared with the control group) in the uterine weight after coumestrol treatment, which supports the estrogen-like activity of coumestrol. Phytoestrogen diminished the liver and skeletal muscle glycogen contents by 18% and 29%, respectively, and increased the blood glucose level by 24%. Glycogenolytic activity of coumestrol was observed when it acted directly on the liver areas. Although phytoestrogen did not influence insulin and glucagon blood level, liver and to some degree muscle susceptibility to insulin (measured as hormone binding by insulin receptors) was decreased. Coumestrol increased the content of triglycerides in muscle by 113% and enhanced the liver lipid synthesis from glucose by 179%. Liver cholesterol concentration was increased both after coumestrol feeding (by 12%) and when it acted directly on the liver (by 16%). These observations suggest that coumestrol is in general anabolic with regard to lipid and catabolic within-carbohydrate metabolism of young ovariectomized female rats. Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that influence of coumestrol on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism of ovariectomized rats is in part not related to its estrogenic action.

It was not possible to know if the observed atypical uterotrophic response of coumestrol was associated uniquely with the ovariectomized urerotrophic assay protocol. This question is answered in the present paper. Two experiments are described in which three daily oral gavage administrations of 60 mg/kg/day coumestrol to immature AP rats were followed by assessment of the reproductive tract on the fourth day. In both experiments coumestrol increased uterine fluid content and increased the weights of the uterus, cervix, and vagina. In addition, bromodeoxyuridine staining of uterine sections enabled confirmation of uterine hyperplasia for the coumestrol-treated animals. In the second experiment, total uterine DNA was determined; it doubled in the coumestrol-treated animals. Estradiol benzoate acted as the positive control agent for both of these experiments, and in each case it gave similar responses to those seen for coumestrol.

We have therefore investigated whether these effects are related. To determine the effects of tamoxifen on mammographic density, mammograms from 94 women who had received tamoxifen for breast cancer and 188 women (without breast cancer) who had not received tamoxifen were visually classified according to the criteria of Wolfe. Two controls were age-matched to each case. All of the women were postmenopausal (ages, 50-64 years), neither group was taking hormone replacement therapy, and none of the cases had received chemotherapy. There were significant differences in breast density between cases and controls at the initial mammogram (P = 0.0001) but no significant differences at the follow-up mammogram (P = 0.51). A significant change to a more lucent pattern had occurred among the case group (P = 0.0001). The odds ratio for cancer that was associated with the more dense (P2 and DY) patterns with respect to the more lucent (N1 and P1) patterns was 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.11- 6.18) at the initial mammogram. This was significantly reduced to 1.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-1.70) after treatment with tamoxifen (P = 0.019; chi2 = 5.52). The substantial reduction in breast density with tamoxifen provides evidence that tamoxifen has the capacity to favorably alter postmenopausal breast density toward a more lucent pattern, which is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer.

At concentrations of less than 10 mug/mL, cells respond to biochanin A by increasing cell growth and de novo DNA synthesis. The addition of biochanin A at concentrations of greater than 30 mug/mL significantly inhibited cell growth and DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in an IC50 value of 40 mug/mL. The reversibility of these inhibitory effects by biochanin A appears also to be concentration dependent. Cells previously treated with high concentrations (>60 mug/mL) of biochanin A did not regain normal growth after treatment ceased. Biochanin A was cytostatic at low concentrations (<40 mug/mL) and cytotoxic at higher concentrations. Upon exposure to 100 mug/mL of biochanin A, cell morphology was severely altered, cell volume decreased, and condensation of cell components was clearly noticeable. In addition, biochanin A damaged cell membranes by increasing membrane permeability.

We characterized these changes according to dose and time posttreatment and established whether potent estrogens (ethinyl estradiol), environmental estrogens (genistein, octylphenol, bisphenol A, parabens), and tamoxifen induce such changes. Rats were administered these compounds neonatally and assessed at several time points during (day 10, or day 18 for some treatments) and after (days 18, 25, 35, and 75) the treatment period to detect any changes in testis weight, distension of the rete testis and efferent ducts, epithelial cell height in the efferent ducts, and immunoexpression of the water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP-1). Treatment with DES (10, 1, or 0.1 mug/injection; equivalent to 0.37, 0.037, or 0.0037 mg/kg/day, respectively) induced dose-dependent changes in testis weight and ail parameters. These effects were most pronounced at days 18 and 25 and appeared to lessen with time, although some persisted into adulthood. Neonatal treatment with ethinyl estradiol (10 mug/injection; equivalent to 0.37 mg/kg/day) caused changes broadly similar to those induced by 10 mug DES. Administration of tamoxifen (2 mg/kg/day) caused changes at 18 days that were similar to those induced by 1 mug DES. Treatment with genistein (4 mg/kg/day), octylphenol (2 mg/injection; equivalent to 150 mg/kg/day), or bisphenol A (0.5 mg/injection; equivalent to 37 mg/kg/day) caused minor but significant (p < 0.05) decreases in epithelial cell height of the efferent ducts at days 18 and/or 25. In animals that were followed through to 35 days and/or adulthood, these changes were no longer obvious; other parameters were either unaffected or were affected only marginally and transiently. Administration of parabens (2 mg/kg/day) had no detectable effect on any parameter at day 18. To establish whether these effects of estrogens were direct or indirect (i.e., resulting from reduced follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone secretion), the above end points were assessed in animals in which gonadotropin secretion was suppressed neonatally by administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist. This treatment permanently reduced testis weight, but did not affect any of the other end points, apart from a minor transient reduction in efferent duct epithelial cell height at 18 days. This study suggests that structural and functional (expression of AQP-1) development of the excurrent ducts is susceptible to impairment by neonatal estrogen exposure, probably as a consequence of direct effects. The magnitude and duration of adverse changes induced by treatment with a range of estrogenic compounds was broadly comparable to their estrogenic potencies reported from in vitro assays.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue article controlled study epithelium cell follitropin release luteinizing hormone release male newborn nonhuman priority journal puberty rat rete testis *testis development testis weight time 4 hydroxybenzoic acid ester/to [Drug Toxicity] 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol/to [Drug Toxicity] aquaporin/ec [Endogenous Compound] diethylstilbestrol/to [Drug Toxicity] *estrogen derivative/to [Drug Toxicity] ethinylestradiol/to [Drug Toxicity] follitropin/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/to [Drug Toxicity] luteinizing hormone/ec [Endogenous Compound] tamoxifen/to [Drug Toxicity]","397-405","107","1999",-1

Two competing pathways in estrogen metabolism involve production of the 2-hydroxylated and 16alpha-hydroxylated metabolites. Because of the proposed differences in biological activities of these metabolites, the balance of the two pathways has been used as a biomarker for breast cancer risk. We examined the effects of flaxseed consumption on urinary estrogen metabolite excretion in postmenopausal women. Twenty-eight postmenopausal women were studied for three seven-week feeding periods in a randomized crossover design. During the feeding periods, subjects consumed their usual diets plus ground flaxseed (0, 5, or 10 g/day).

Sigman","Chemoprevention of prostate cancer: Concepts and strategies","Chemoprevention is the administration of agents to prevent induction and inhibit or delay progression of cancers. For prostate, as for other cancer targets, successful chemopreventive strategies require well-characterized agents, suitable cohorts, and reliable intermediate biomarkers of cancer for evaluating chemopreventive efficacy. Agent requirements are experimental or epidemiological data showing chemopreventive efficacy, safety on chronic administration, and a mechanistic rationale for the observed chemopreventive activity. On this basis, promising chemopreventive drugs in prostate include retinoids, antiandrogens, antiestrogens, steroid aromatase inhibitors, 5alpha-reductase inhibitors, vitamins D and E, selenium, lycopene, and 2-difluoromethylornithine. Phase II trials are critical for evaluating chemopreventive efficacy. Cohorts in these trials should be suitable for measuring the chemopreventive activity of the agent and the intermediate biomarkers chosen as endpoints. Many cohorts proposed for phase II trials are patients with previous cancers or premalignant lesions. For such patients, trials should be conducted within the context of standard treatment. Two cohorts currently used in phase II prostate cancer chemoprevention trials are patients with PIN and patients scheduled for prostate cancer surgery. Biomarkers should fit expected biological mechanisms, be assayed reliably and quantitatively, measured easily, and correlate to decreased cancer incidence. Protocols for adequately sampling tissue are essential. Changes in PIN provide prostate biomarkers with the ability to be quantified and a high correlation to cancer. PIN measurements include nuclear polymorphism, nucleolar size and number of nucleoli/nuclei, and DNA ploidy. Other potentially useful biomarkers are associated with cellular proliferation kinetics (e.g. PCNA and apoptosis), differentiation (e.g. blood group antigens, vimentin), genetic damage (e.g. LOH on chromosome 8), signal transduction (e.g. TGFalpha, TGFbeta, IGF-I, c-erbB-2 expression), angiogenesis, and biochemical changes (e.g. PSA levels).",NA,"angiogenesis apoptosis *cancer prevention cell differentiation cell proliferation chemoprophylaxis conference paper DNA damage human male nucleolus ploidy priority journal *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] *prostate cancer/pc [Prevention] signal transduction alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] anastrozole/dt [Drug Therapy] antiandrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] antiestrogen/dt [Drug Therapy] aromatase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] bicalutamide/dt [Drug Therapy] blood group antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] cycline/ec [Endogenous Compound] cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] eflornithine/dt [Drug Therapy] fenretinide/dt [Drug Therapy] finasteride/dt [Drug Therapy] flutamide/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone/dt [Drug Therapy] isoflavone derivative/dt [Drug Therapy] lipoxygenase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] lycopene/dt [Drug Therapy] nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent/dt [Drug Therapy] oltipraz/dt [Drug Therapy] perillyl alcohol/dt [Drug Therapy] raloxifene/dt [Drug Therapy] retinoid/dt [Drug Therapy] selenium/dt [Drug Therapy] steroid 5alpha reductase inhibitor/dt [Drug Therapy] toremifene/dt [Drug Therapy] tumor marker/ec [Endogenous Compound] unindexed drug vimentin/ec [Endogenous Compound] vitamin D/dt [Drug Therapy] vorozole/dt [Drug Therapy]","342-350","35","1999",-1

In the United States, 180,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997, and approximately 97,000 of these women have an extremely low chance of suffering a recurrence of their cancer. With an average age at diagnosis of 60 years and a 25-year expected duration of survival, the current number of breast cancer survivors in the United States may approach 2.5 million women. Since breast cancer is now being detected at an earlier stage than previously and since adjuvant chemotherapy may cause ovarian failure, an increasing number of women are becoming postmenopausal at a younger age after breast cancer treatment.

The production of inositol phosphates (InsP) by agonists and AlF4- was partly inhibited (35-40%) by genistein and tyrphostins, two PTK inhibitors. Genistein attenuated uterine contractions elicited by the stimulation of muscarinic and bombesin receptors, whereas pervanadate, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, potentiated receptor- mediated contraction. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected in detergent extracts from agonist- and pervanadate-stimulated myometrium. The amount of InsP produced in response to pervanadate was related to the tyrosine phosphorylation status of phospholipase C-1. In contrast, with ET- 1 and bombesin, phosphorylated phospholipase C-1 made a minor contribution. Additional findings were rather consistent with a role for Ca2+. In fura- 2-loaded cells, genistein partly decreased both the transient and sustained intracellular Ca2+ concentration phases induced by bombesin. The removal of extracellular Ca2+ or the addition of nifedipine inhibited (35%) InsP production due to bombesin and ET-1. The inhibitory effects of genistein and tyrphostins were abolished in Ca2+-depleted medium, were not additive with that of nifedipine, and (as for nifedipine) were counteracted by the Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644.

This report constitutes a comparison of the growth-promoting activity of procyanidin oligomers and the target cells of procyanidins in the skin. Results show that procyanidin dimer and trimer exhibit higher growth- promoting activity than the monomer. The maximum growth-promoting activity for hair epithelial cells with procyanidin B-2, an epicatechin dimer, reached about 300% (30 muM) relative to controls (= 100%) in a 5 d culture. Optimum concentration of procyanidin C-1, an epicatechin trimer, was lower than that of procyanidin B-2; the maximum growth-promoting activity of procyanidin C-1 was about 220% (3 muM). No other flavonoid compounds examined exhibit higher proliferative activities than the procyanidins. In skin constituent cells, only epithelial cells such as hair keratinocytes or epidermal keratinocytes respond to procyanidin oligomers. Topical application of 1% procyanidin oligomers on shaven C3H mice in the telogen phase led to significant hair regeneration [procyanidin B-2, 69.6% + 21.8% (mean + SD); procyanidin B-3, 80.9% + 13.0%; procyanidin C-1, 78.3% + 7.6%] on the basis of the shaven area; application of vehicle only led to regeneration of 41.7% (SD = 16.3%).

Fractures frequently result in dependency and institutionalization, as well as physical deformities that may lead to respiratory and cardiovascular problems. Currently, no drugs exist to promote new bone formation. Thus care of the elderly focuses primarily on lifestyle modification and increased dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D; decreased intake of caffeine, phosphates, and alcohol; smoking cessation; increased exercise; and drugs. Drugs for preventing osteoporosis include supplemental calcium and vitamin D, hormone replacement therapy, and alendronate. Drugs that enhance bone loss or increase the likelihood of falls should be eliminated, if possible, or the dosages adjusted. Making residences safer will also help to minimize the potential for falls. Drugs for treating osteoporosis include hormone replacement therapy, alendronate, and nasal calcitonin.

Assessment of oestrogenicity using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays","Phytosterols are natural constituents of the human diet, and as part of an extensive programme of safety evaluation studies investigating their use as a novel food ingredient, the possible oestrogenic effects of phytosterols have been investigated using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays. Competitive binding with the immature rat uterine oestrogen receptor (ER) has been used to measure the ability of phytosterols to bind to ERs while the transcriptional activation of oestrogen-responsive genes has been examined in an oestrogen-inducible yeast screen. Phytosterols did not display any activity in these in vitro assays. Uterotrophic assays have been conducted to investigate the potential for phytosterols to elicit an oestrogenic response when administered orally to immature female rats (n=10) at doses of 0, 5, 50 or 500mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days. Phytosterols (a well characterized mixture of beta-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol) and phytosterol esters (the previous phytosterol mixture esterified with fatty acids from sunflower oil) did not exhibit oestrogenic activity in the immature female rat using uterine wet weight as the endpoint. beta-oestradiol (0.4mg/kg/day) consistently produced a significant increase in uterus weights. Coumestrol (a known phytoestrogen) was also tested as a weak positive control and produced a dose response at doses of 20, 40 and 80mg/kg/day in the uterotrophic assay. In conclusion, we have shown that phytosterols do not bind to the ER and do not stimulate transcriptional activity of the human ER in a recombinant yeast strain. In addition, there was no indication of oestrogenicity from the uterotrophic assay when the material was administered by oral gavage to immature female rats.

In these systems the relative stoichiometry of receptors compared to other cell components might be changed, which may lead to anomalies in cellular responses in contrast to natural occurring systems. In the present study, we have used primary cultures of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from human myometrium to characterize the proliferative effects of agonists binding to two different G protein-coupled receptors. Treatment of quiescent SMCs with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and noradrenaline resulted in significant increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation. However, LPA was almost four times more effective than noradrenaline in this respect. The proliferative effects of the agonists could be completely blocked by pertussis toxin, indicating that the response are mediated through G(i/o)-proteins. The selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor (alpha2-AR) antagonist yohimbine dose-dependently reduced the effect of noradrenaline suggesting that the proliferative response was mediated through alpha2-ARs. The proliferative effects induced by LPA and noradrenaline was markedly reduced in SMCs treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and the cAMP elevating compound forskolin. However, LPA but not noradrenaline induced rapid rises in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+](i). The ability to increase Ca2+ might be one explanation why LPA produce a more pronounced proliferative response than noradrenaline in primary cultures of human myometrial SMCs.",NA,"article cell differentiation cell proliferation cell structure DNA synthesis human human cell human tissue immunoblotting ligand binding *myometrium protein binding protein family *receptor intrinsic activity *smooth muscle fiber stoichiometry *alpha 2 adrenergic receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *lysophosphatidic acid *lysophosphatidic acid receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] noradrenalin pertussis toxin radioligand thymidine unclassified drug","11-21","11","1998",-1

These adverse effects of environmental estrogens have raised considerable concern and have received increasing attention. Although numerous chemicals with the capacity to interfere with the estrogen receptor (ER) have been identified, information on their molecular mechanism of action and their relative potency is rather limited. For the endometrium, the lack of information is due to the lack of a suitable experimental model. We investigated the functions of phytoestrogens in an endometrial-derived model, RUCA-I rat endometrial adenocarcinoma cells. The cells were cultured on a reconstituted basement membrane to preserve their functional differentiation and estrogen responsiveness. We assessed the relative binding affinity to the estrogen receptor of the selected phytoestrogens coumestrol, genistein, daidzein, and the putative phytoestrogen mangostin compared to estradiol by a competitive Scatchard analysis. The following affinity ranking was measured: 17beta-estradiol >>> coumestrol > genistein > daidzein >>> mangostin. In addition, we investigated the capacity of these compounds to promote the increased production of complement C3, a well-known estradiol-regulated protein of the rat endometrium. All substances tested increased the production of complement C3, although different concentrations were necessary to achieve equivalent levels of induction compared to estradiol. Mechanistically we were able to demonstrate that the increase of complement C3 production was mediated by primarily increasing its steady-state mRNA level. These findings indicate that RUCA-I cells represent a sensitive model system to elucidate relative potencies and functions of environmental estrogens in an endometrium-derived model.",NA,"animal cell article basement membrane binding affinity cell culture cell line concentration response controlled study drug potency drug receptor binding drug structure *endometrium endometrium carcinoma *estrogen activity *experimental model extracellular matrix female molecular biology nonhuman priority journal rat Scatchard plot complement component C3/ec [Endogenous Compound] coumestrol/cm [Drug Comparison] coumestrol/pd [Pharmacology] daidzein/cm [Drug Comparison] daidzein/pd [Pharmacology] estradiol/cm [Drug Comparison] estradiol/pd [Pharmacology] estrogen receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] mangostin/cm [Drug Comparison] mangostin/pd [Pharmacology] messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound] n butyl 11 (3,17beta dihydroxyestra 1,3,5(10) trien 7alpha yl) n methylundecanamide *phytoestrogen/cm [Drug Comparison] *phytoestrogen/pd [Pharmacology] tamoxifen unclassified drug","581-586","106","1998",-1

In intact adults, genistein (2.5 mg s.c./kg of body weight/day for 9 days) reduced testicular and serum testosterone concentrations, pituitary LH-content and prostate weight. In castrated adults, genistein (0.025-2.5 mg s.c./kg of body weight) increased expression of c-fos gene in prostatic urethra. In adult, neonatally estrogenized mice showing an increased estrogen sensitivity, a 10-day treatment with genistein (2.5 mg s.c./kg of body weight) induced development of squamous epithelial metaplasia in prostatic collecting ducts.

Kivilaakso","Induction of proliferation in isolated guinea pig gastric epithelium during restitution after superficial injury","Immediate repair of the gastrointestinal epithelium after superficial injury is called restitution. It is based on the migration of the surviving mucoid neck cells over the area of injury. The involvement of growth factors in the process has been recently documented. They are known to enhance the process (ie, EGF, FGF, TGF-beta) and to activate the basolateral Na+-H+- antiport (EGF). They may exert their effect by activating intracellular tyrosine kinases or by inducing chemotaxis. Yet, their precise mechanism of action in the process is unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of modulation of the signal transduction pathway on the occurrence of proliferative mucoid neck and foveolar cells in guinea pig gastric epithelium. Therefore guinea pig gastric epithelium was mounted in Ussing chambers in vitro and perfused 4 hr after superficial injury with 1.25 M NaCl. The potential difference over the epithelium and tissue resistance were recorded simultaneously. The tissue was exposed either to cycloheximide, genistein, or to 4-phorbol myristate 13-acetate (PMA) during the 4-hr recovery, and the expression of proliferative cells was assessed by staining the tissue for proliferative cells (Ki-67). The mean proliferative index of tissues subjected to NaCl injury was significantly higher than that of uninjured control tissues after 4 hr of restitution. Inhibition of the signaling pathway with genistein decreased the proliferative index significantly, while its stimulation with phorbol myristate increased it. Both electrophysiologic and morphologic restitution were sensitive to genistein, but not to PMA or cycloheximide. Superficial epithelial injury results in a significantly increased occurrence of proliferative cells in isolated guinea pig gastric epithelium. This endogenous activation of the tissue is sensitive to inhibition by tyrosine kinases and to stimulation by protein kinases.

The overall dataset included the following incident, histologically confirmed neoplasms: oral cavity and pharynx 181, oesophagus 316, stomach 745, colon 828, rectum 498, liver 428, gallbladder 60, pancreas 362, larynx 242, breast 3,412, endometrium 750, ovary 971, prostate 127, bladder 431, kidney 190, thyroid 208, Hodgkin's disease 80, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas 200, multiple myelomas 120. Controls were 7,990 patients admitted to hospital for acute, non-neoplastic conditions, unrelated to long-term modifications in diet and not likely to have been caused by tobacco or alcohol use. Odds ratios (OR) for subsequent scores (never/occasional/ frequent) of whole grain food consumption were derived after allowance for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol intake and body mass index. High intake of whole grain foods consistently reduced risk of neoplasm at all sites, except thyroid. The ORs for the highest category of consumption were 0.2-0.3 for upper digestive and respiratory tract neoplasms, 0.5 for stomach, colon and gallbladder, 0.7 for rectum, 0.6 for liver, 0.8 for pancreas and prostate, 0.9 for breast and endometrium, 0.6 for ovary, 0.4 for bladder and kidney, 1.3 for thyroid and around 0.5 for lymphomas and myeloma. The tests for trend in risks were significant for all neoplasms, except pancreas, endometrium, Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma. No significant heterogeneity was found across strata of age at diagnosis, sex, education, smoking habit, alcohol intake and body mass index. Thus, even in the absence of a univocal and satisfactory biological interpretation, the consistency of the patterns observed indicate that, in this population, higher frequency of whole grain food intake is an indicator of reduced risk of several neoplasms.",NA,"adult aged alcohol consumption article body mass breast cancer cancer incidence *cancer risk data analysis *food intake gene frequency grain *head and neck cancer histopathology Hodgkin disease human Italy major clinical study multiple myeloma pancreas cancer priority journal prostate cancer rectum cancer risk factor smoking habit antioxidant flavonoid indole isothiocyanic acid phenol derivative phytoestrogen","24-28","77","1998",-1

Rau","Position paper of the american council on science and health on risk factors for breast cancer: Established, speculated, and unsupported","This article provides the position of the American Council on Science and Health regarding how breast cancer is defined and classified; the magnitude of the public health problem of breast cancer among women; the implications of variation in incidence of breast cancer internationally and with migration; access to health care as a factor in slight differences in incidence and mortality rates among African-American and white women; and the evidence concerning various proposed human-breast-cancer risk factors. The article classifies risk factors as either established, speculated, or unsupported on the basis of available evidence. Specific genes have been identified that may explain as much as 5-10% of new breast cancer cases. Inherited predispositions may be characterized by family history of breast or ovarian cancer, young age at diagnosis, breast cancer diagnosed in both breasts, and male breast cancer. Benign breast disease (BBD), particularly the subtypes of BBD involving atypical hyperplasia, and exposure early in life to ionizing radiation is an established risk factor for breast cancer. Several reproductive characteristics are established as risk factors for breast cancer: early age at menarche, first full-term pregnancy after age 35 years of age, and late age of menopause. Obesity and low physical activity are established as risk factors for breast cancer and are modifiable. Speculated risk factors for breast cancer that are gaining scientific support include nulliparity, oral contraceptive use, and postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy. Speculated risk factors for which there is conflicting or preliminary support include not breast feeding, postmenopausal estrogen progestogen replacement therapy, prescribed diethylstilbestrol, low consumption of phytoestrogens, specific dietary practices, alcohol consumption, not using nonsteroidal antinflammatory drugs, abortion, and breast augmentation. Unsupported risk factors include higher than average consumption of phytoestrogens, premenopausal obesity, electromagnetic fields, and low-dose ionizing radiation after 40 years of age.

Using a cell-free assay with testosterone as substrate, we showed that LNCaP had UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) activity. Because dietary factors, such as flavonoids in soy products, may reduce the risk for hormone-dependent cancers, we studied the effects of flavonoids on testosterone-UDPGT activity. LNCaP cells were exposed to selected flavonoids for up to 6 days. The increase in UDPGT-specific activity was linear over this period. Of the compounds tested, biochanin A was the most potent, with increased activity at concentration range 0.5-50 muM. Activities were linear for time and protein and were unaffected by flavonoids added directly to the assay. Kinetics studies showed no change in K(m) for testosterone in the face of these large increases in specific activity. Cellular metabolism of testosterone reflected the increase in enzyme activity. Intact cells treated with biochanin A produced testosterone-glucuronide from testosterone at twice the rate of controls. The steroid form of the UDPGT transcript was expressed in LNCaP cells and was enhanced in biochanin A-treated LNCaP cells. Additionally, biochanin A markedly decreased prostate specific antigen (PSA) level against the effect of testosterone on PSA production. Biochanin A significantly decreased the testosterone-stimulated release of PSA, presumably because biochanin A increased UDPGT and increased the intracellular glucuronidation of testosterone. These studies suggest that the modulation of hormone metabolism by dietary factors may be important in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.",NA,"article *cancer cell controlled study enzyme activity human human cell male metabolism priority journal *prostate cancer androgen *biochanin A flavonoid *glucuronosyltransferase/ec [Endogenous Compound] *prostate specific antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] testosterone","2379-2384","58","1998",-1

The influence of these treatments on clinical outcome and biological indices was evaluated. OKG administration significantly improved nitrogen balance and reduced 3-methylhistidine and hydroxyproline urinary elimination. This was associated with a gradual rise in plasma glutamine over time. Given as a bolus, OKG significantly improved would healing, assessed both clinically [day of last graft: (mean + SEM) OKG bolus 23.7 + 2.1 d versus Protil-1, 39.9 + 9.9 d; P < 0.05] and by hydroxyproline excretion, and biological markers of nitrogen metabolism, and tended to reduce duration of enteral nutrition (P = 0.12). The higher catabolic status in the patients administered 20 g OKG/d at the onset of the study, despite randomized, precludes any definite conclusion (concerning the dose-effect relationship). However, based on 3-methylhistidine elimination, our data indicate a benefit of 30 g OKG/d administration over 10 g/d. This study further supports OKG supplementation in burn patients.

Cancer of the breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, prostate, and testis were selected for comparison and analysis of trends in incidence and mortality. The incidences of cryptorchidism and hypospadias were selected as birth defects representative of possible effects from in utero exposure to excessive estrogens. Sperm counts and endometriosis were selected as other possible indicators of environmental estrogen effects. Wide, sometimes orders of magnitude, variability exists between incidences in some indicators between different geographical areas and between ethnic groups. Some explanations unrelated to environmental exposures are apparent, and some observations contradict a universal exposure to the same endocrine-modulating substance.

Doxorubicin (dox) uptake was significantly reduced in large spheroids (diameter 400+ 70 mum), which consist predominantly of quiescent cells, as compared to small spheroids (diameter 100 + 50 mum), which consist entirely of proliferating cells. After removal of dox from the incubation medium, dox fluorescence declined more efficiently in large spheroids, which led to a decreased dox toxicity as revealed by colonyforming assays. Verapamil significantly increased dox retention in large spheroids and, consequently, augmented dox toxicity. At a depth 80 mum from the spheroid periphery, a significantly decreased dox fluorescence was observed in the deep, quiescent cell layers of large spheroids. The Pglycoprotein- mediated multidrug resistance (MDR)-reversing agents verapamil, cyclosporin A, quinidine, sodium orthovanadate and tamoxifen significantly increased dox fluorescence at this depth, whereas genistein, indomethacin, probenecid and brefeldin A, which reverse multidrugresistance-associated protein (MRP) function, exerted no effect. Anti-P-glycoprotein immunohistochemistry of multicellular tumor spheroids revealed an increase of P-glycoprotein expression in large speroids as compared to small spheroids, which was most prominent in the Ki-67-negative, quiescent cell layers 60 to 100 mum distant from the periphery of the spheroid, indicating that the MDR phenotype is related to cell quiescence. This was corroborated by whole-cell patchclamp experiments, where the C219 antibody, which is directed against the ATP- binding site of P-glycoprotein, significantly inhibited P-glycoprotein- associated, volume-activated chloride currents in quiescent, but not proliferating cells from multicellular tumor spheroids.",NA,"article cancer chemotherapy cell proliferation chloride current colony formation controlled study culture medium drug sensitivity drug uptake human human cell immunohistochemistry *multicellular spheroid *multidrug resistance patch clamp priority journal *prostate cancer/dr [Drug Resistance] brefeldin A cyclosporin A *doxorubicin genistein *glycoprotein P/ec [Endogenous Compound] indometacin Ki 67 antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] probenecid quinidine tamoxifen vanadate sodium verapamil","855-863","75","1998",-1

Over 150 herbs traditionally used by herbalists for treating a variety of health problems were extracted and tested for their relative capacity to compete with estradiol and progesterone binding to intracellular receptors for progesterone (PR) and estradiol (ER) in intact human breast cancer cells. The six highest ER-binding herbs that are commonly consumed were soy, licorice, red clover, thyme, tumeric, hops, and verbena. The six highest PR-binding herbs and spices commonly consumed were oregano, verbena, tumeric, thyme, red clover and damiana. Some of the herbs and spices found to contain high phytoestrogens and phytoprogestins were further tested for bioactivity based on their ability to regulate cell growth rate in ER (+) and ER (-) breast cancer cell lines and to induce or inhibit the synthesis of alkaline phosphatase, an end product of progesterone action, in PR (+) cells. In general, we found that ER-binding herbal extracts were agonists, much like estradiol, whereas PR-binding extracts, were neutral or antagonists. The bioavailability of phytoestrogens and phytoprogestins in vivo were studied by quantitating the ER-binding and PR-binding capacity of saliva following consumption of soy milk, exogenous progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, or wild mexican yam products containing diosgenin. Soy milk caused a dramatic increase in saliva ER-binding components without a concommitant rise in estradiol. Consumption of PR-binding herbs increased the progestin activity of saliva, but there were marked differences in bioactivity.

We conducted an experiment in ovariectomized rats to determine the independent effects of dietary soybean estrogens (SBE) and the interactions of these agents with the commonly used pharmaceutical estrogen preparation (conjugated equine estrogens, CEE) in the vagina and uterus. We looked at the effects of SBE and CEE, alone and in combination, on uterine weight, body weight, vaginal cytology, uterine luminal epithelial height, and immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), lactoferrin (Ltf), and apoptosis. Ovariectomized rats were fed diets containing casein or soybean protein (SBE, low dose = 11.6 mg isoflavones/1800 cal; high dose = 117.8 mg/1800 cal), with no CEE, low dose CEE (0.313 mg/1800 cal), or high dose CEE (0.625 mg/1800 cal) added. In this study, SBE did not demonstrate estrogenic activity for uterine weight or vaginal cytology. We also found no estrogenic effects of these doses of SBE for PCNA, apoptosis, Ltf staining, or for LEH measurements. In addition, our results regarding the interactions of SBE and CEE do not show any evidence that the combination is additive in effect. On the contrary, the LEH response induced by low levels of CEE, was reduced by high levels of SBE. Furthermore, the Ltf response induced by CEE also was reduced by high levels of SBE. This suggests that high doses of SBE may antagonize the estrogen-agonist actions of low doses of CEE in the rat uterus.

Primary cultures of rat renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were exposed to a superoxide-generating system to induce injury in the absence of overt necrosis. Integrin function was antagonized by the integrin recognition sequence tetrapeptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp (GRGD) or monoclonal antibody to beta1-integrin. Injured cells had reduced thymidine uptake compared with normal cells. The presence of GRGD during recovery from injury caused a further 44% reduction in DNA synthesis but did not affect DNA synthesis in normal cells. Injured cells had an increased proportion of apoptosis that was further accentuated by exposed to GRGD during recovery. Integrin antagonism also stimulated apoptosis in uninjured cells. To investigate signal transduction mechanisms for this effect of integrins, inhibitors and activators of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and protein kinase C (PKC) were evaluated Activation of PKC stimulated cellular proliferation, whereas inhibitors of PKC and PTK had no significant effect. Genistein, a PTK inhibitor, induced apoptosis in normal cells, mimicking the effect of integrin inhibition. On the other hand, PMA, an activator of PKC, prevented cells from becoming apoptotic when exposed to injury plus GRGD. The phosphorylation status of intracellular proteins was evaluated by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. A similar pattern of decreased phosphorylation was observed after either integrin inhibition, injury, both, or PTK inhibition. These findings suggest that kinase cascades are involved in the effects of integrins on renal epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. After injury, an interaction between cells and the extracellular matrix is required for cells to proliferate and contribute to repair rather than to enter an apoptotic pathway.",NA,"animal cell apoptosis article cell interaction cell proliferation cell survival DNA synthesis inhibition enzyme inhibition epithelium cell *kidney epithelium *kidney injury/di [Diagnosis] nonhuman priority journal protein phosphorylation rat signal transduction *integrin/cr [Drug Concentration] *protein kinase C/cr [Drug Concentration]","1511-1520","52","1997",-1

Study design: The infants received, in addition to solid food, only one type of milk: human milk (n = 218), a ready-to-use liquid formula (n = 139), a powdered formula (n = 33), or soy formula (n = 7). Results: Mean fat intakes were low and varied from 28% to 31% of energy; the milks provided 43% to 64% of the fat. The mean polyunsaturated/saturated fat ratios of solid foods were from 0.52 to 0.63 and of milks from 0.20 to 0.45.

The breast-fed infants had markedly higher serum concentrations of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) than the infants fed any of the formulas. Conclusion: The typical fatty acid patterns of breast- or formula-fed infants were still evident in 7-month-old infants who already received 60% to 70% of their energy from solid food.

The effects of the three flavonoids were also studied on the contraction elicited by CaCl2 (30 muM to 10 mM) on rat uterus incubated in medium lacking calcium and supplemented with 33, 60 or 90 mM of KCl. For comparison, the effects of the calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil and the activator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin were assayed on contractions induced by KCl and CaCl2. 2. Genistein (IC50: 20.2 + 1.0 muM, n = 11), kaempferol (IC50: 10.1 + 0.8 muM, n = 8) and quercetin (IC50: 13.2 + 0.5 muM, n = 8) relaxed the tonic contraction induced by KCl (60 mM) in a concentration-dependent way. Verapamil (IC50: 70.1 + 5.8 nM, n = 7), nifedipine (IC50: 8.4 + 0.7 nM, n = 6) and forskolin (IC50: 0.62 + 0.08 muM, n = 14) also relaxed the KCl-induced contraction. TPCK (3 muM) significantly antagonized the effect of quercetin, kaempferol and forskolin (P < 0.01) but did not modify the effect of genistein. 3. Spermine (1 mM) increased the effects of genistein and verapamil and antagonized the effect of quercetin but did not modify those of kaempferol and forskolin. DFMO (10 mM) did not modify the effect of quercetin but increased that of genistein and antagonized those of kaempferol and forskolin. The addition of spermine (1 mM) plus DFMO (10 mM) antagonized the effect of quercetin. Spermine counteracted the effect of DFMO on forskolin but not on genistein. 4. KCl (33, 60 or 90 mM) did not produce contraction in calcium-free solution, but CaCl2 (30 muM to 10 mM) induced concentration-dependent contraction after depolarizing with KCl. The EC50 values for CaCl2 were: 0.74 + 0.08 (n = 12), 0.34 + 0.03 (n = 14) and 0.48 + 0.02 (n = 12) mM in a medium with 33, 60 or 90 mM of KCl, respectively. 5. Genistein (20 muM), kaempferol (10 muM), quercetin (15 muM), verapamil (70 mM), nifedipine (10 nM) and forskolin (0.5 muM) inhibited the concentration-response curve to CaCl2 in medium supplemented with 33, 60 or 90 mM of KCl. The effect of kaempferol was independent of the concentration of KCl in the incubation medium. However, the inhibitory effect of genistein on CaCl2-induced contraction was inversely related to the concentration of KCl in the medium. On the contrary, the effect of quercetin was directly related to the effect of quercetin was directly related to the concentration of KCl in the medium. 6. The antagonism of verapamil, nifedipine and forskolin on CaCl2-induced contraction seems to be related to the degree of depolarization because increasing the KCl in the medium counteracted with their effects. 7. Our results suggest that (1) cAMP contributes to the relaxant effects of quercetin and kaempferol on KCl (60 mM)-induced tonic contraction; (2) polyamines are involved in the relaxant effects of forskolin and kaempferol on KCl-induced tonic contraction but not on CaCl2-induced contraction in the depolarized uterus, and (3) the flavonoids assayed also possess a calcium antagonist action but show a different behavior toward the calcium channel blockers and the cAMP enhancer forskolin.",NA,"animal experiment article *calcium antagonism calcium transport controlled study *depolarization drug effect female leisure *myometrium nonhuman priority journal rat smooth muscle relaxation *uterus cyclic AMP/ec [Endogenous Compound] *flavonoid/pk [Pharmacokinetics] forskolin/ec [Endogenous Compound] *genistein/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *kaempferol/pk [Pharmacokinetics] *quercetin/pk [Pharmacokinetics]","847-857","29","1997",-1

Fifty-five patients, including 35 patients with ductal carcinomas and 20 with inflammatory pancreatic masses, underwent contrast-enhanced sonography, CT, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Carbon dioxide microbubbles were prepared by mixing 10 ml of carbon dioxide and the same amount of 25% soybean oil vigorously. Carbon dioxide microbubbles were injected through an angiographic catheter that was placed in the celiac axis. Vascularity of the tumors as determined by those three techniques was interpreted by three physicians who had no knowledge of the pathologic results. RESULTS. Contrast-enhanced sonography was best at revealing tumor vascularity among the three techniques. On contrast-enhanced sonography, 19 (95%) of the 20 inflammatory pancreatic masses were isovascular and 32 (91%) of the 35 ductal carcinomas were hypovascular. In contrast, the isovascularity of inflammatory masses was five (25%) on cT, and two (10%) on DSA, respectively. The sensitivity and accuracy rate of differentiating both diseases on contrast-enhanced sonography were 98% and 95%, respectively; on CT, they were both 73%; and on DSA they were both 67%. From our results, an isovascular mass is probably an inflammatory mass, whereas a hypovascular mass is most likely a ductal carcinoma on contrast- enhanced sonography. CONCLUSION. Contrast-enhanced sonography can help differentiate an inflammatory pancreatic mass from a ductal carcinoma.",NA,"adult article cell differentiation contrast enhancement diagnostic accuracy female human human tissue intraductal carcinoma/di [Diagnosis] major clinical study male oxygenator *pancreas tumor/di [Diagnosis] priority journal tumor blood flow *carbon dioxide","1263-1267","169","1997",-1

The effect of systemic CEA on the production of proinflammatory cytokines was investigated in mice and compared to levels induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 peaked 1 h after an i.v. CEA injection of 40 mug/mouse to 37-54% of the maximal level induced by a 1 mug/mouse injection of LPS in both normal and immunoincompetent mice. The CEA induction of IL-6 was a specific response, because the peptide PELPK (the pentapeptide on CEA that is the ligand for the CEA receptor on Kupffer cells) conjugated to albumin induced 30% of the maximal CEA response for IL-6, whereas the specificity control PELGK-conjugated albumin did not. IL-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels after i.v. injection of CEA were only 3-5% of those induced by LPS. The IL-6 responses of mice pretreated with 100 mug/kg genistein were decreased by more than 40%. However, genistein inhibited the TNF-alpha response to LPS by 46% but increased the CEA-induced response by 300%. When murine Kupffer cells were stimulated with LPS or CEA in vitro, LPS increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a M(r) 30,000 protein, whereas CEA decreased phosphorylation of a M(r) 60,000 protein and did not increase phosphorylation of the M(r) 30,000 protein. Thus, i.v. CEA stimulates production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha after binding to Kupffer cells through signal transduction pathways that appear to be different from those stimulated by LPS.",NA,"animal experiment animal model *antigen presentation article chromosome 19 controlled study cross reaction enzyme inhibition epithelium cell *gene induction gene location Kupffer cell mouse multigene family nonhuman priority journal protein phosphorylation signal transduction *carcinoembryonic antigen/cr [Drug Concentration] *cytokine interleukin 6 lipopolysaccharide","4432-4436","57","1997",-1

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect VEGF mRNA in uterine tissues from nonpregnant (NP), midpregnant (MP, 15-16 days), and late-pregnant (LP, 19-21 days) rats and in placentas from MP and LP rats. VEGF mRNA levels in uteri and placentas were determined by Northern blotting, and the vasorelaxant activity of recombinant human VEGF (rh-VEGF) was tested and compared in isolated uterine arteries from LP and NP animals. VEGF120 and VEGF164 were the major isoforms detected in uterine tissues; all members of the VEGF family (VEGF120, VEGF164, VEGF188, and VEGF205) were expressed in LP placentas. VEGF mRNA levels increased 60% in MP and 80% in LP above those in NP (P < 0.05) in uterine tissues; VEGF mRNA levels were also detectable in placentas and elevated approximately fivefold in LP vs. MP tissues (P < 0.01). Phenylephrine-preconstricted uterine arcuate arteries (NP and LP) dilated in response to rhVEGF, an effect that was completely abolished by endothelial denudation or pretreatment with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The magnitude of dilation to an intermediate concentration of rhVEGF (1 nM) was greater in LP than in NP vessels (55 + 8 vs. 24 + 11%; P < 0.05), and this effect was diminished comparably in both groups (~ 60%) by N-nitro-L-arginine, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis.

In this retrospective analysis we compare the outcome and the toxicity of 29 patients with high-risk Stage II-III and 19 metastatic breast cancer patients who underwent HDC with ASCT. Thirteen patients underwent transplant with soybean agglutinin (SBA)-purged graft, while 35 consecutive patients received unmanipulated graft. Engraftment was significantly faster for the nonpurged transplant. No differences in disease- free survival, freedom from relapse, or overall survival were noted in both groups during a median follow up time of 14 months.

Gerritsen","Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor promotes adhesion of lymphoma cells to extracellular matrix molecules via alpha4beta1 and alpha5/beta1 integrins","Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor (SF) is the ligand for a tyrosine kinase cell surface receptor encoded by the MET protooncogene (c- MET). HGF/SF can induce proliferation and motility in epithelial cells and promotes invasion of carcinoma cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts transfected with both HGF/SF and c-MET genes. Our results show that HGF/SF and c-MET also play a role in adhesion and invasion of human lymphoma cells. c-MET mRNA is expressed in hemopoietic cells, such as hemopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+ cells) in bone marrow (BM) and mobilized peripheral blood, immature B cells in cord blood and BM, and germinal center B-centroblasts. In normal peripheral blood B cells, which are c-MET-, c-MET expression was induced by PMA, ConA, HGF/SF, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected c-MET on the cell surface of large activated centroblasts in lymph nodes from patients with B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. In the latter group, c-MET expression correlated well with the presence of EBV. Because HGF/SF and c-MET promote metastasis of carcinoma cells, we studied the effects of c-MET stimulation by HGF/SF of B-lymphoma cells on properties relevant for metastasis, ie, adhesion, migration, and invasion. HGF/SF stimulated adhesion of the c-MET+ B-cell lines to the extracellular matrix molecules fibronectin (FN) and collagen (CN) in a dose dependent manner. However, adhesion to laminin was not affected by HGF/SF. Adhesion to FN was mediated by beta1-integrins alpha4beta1 (VLA4) and alpha5beta (VLA5) since blocking antibodies against beta1- (CD29), alpha4(CD49d), or alpha5- (CD49e) integrin subunits, completely reversed the effect of HGF/SF. Furthermore, HGF/SF induced adhesion was abrogated by addition of genistein, which blocks protein tyrosine kinases, including c- MET. Addition of HGF/SF resulted in a sixfold increase in migration of c-MET B-lymphoma cells through Matrigel, compared to medium alone. In rat fibroblast cultures, HGF/SF doubled the number of c-MET+ B-lymphoma cells that invaded the fibroblast monolayer. In these adhesion, migration and invasion assays HGF/SF had no effect on c-MET cell lines. In conclusion, c- MET is expressed or can be induced on immature, activated, and certain malignant B cells. HGF/SF increased adhesion of c-MET+ B-lymphoma cells to FN and CN, mediated via beta1-integrins alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1, and furthermore promoted migration and invasion.",NA,"article B lymphocyte bone marrow *cell adhesion cell invasion cell migration cell surface Epstein Barr virus *extracellular matrix germinal center hematopoietic stem cell human human cell immunohistochemistry lymphoma cell metastasis priority journal umbilical cord blood cell surface receptor collagen fibronectin *integrin laminin matrigel *scatter factor","990-1000","89","1997",-1

When cultured at the high temperature, restrictive temperature at 39.4degreeC, tsFn10 cells can be arrested at G2 phase and are large in size. Four hours after release from G2 arrest, the cells entered into the G1 phase. At this time, G1 phase cells were easily discriminated from the G2/M-cells by their size under microscopic observation. The cell-morphology-based bioassay utilizing tsFT210 cells is very simple and sensitive for detecting cdc2 kinase inhibitors and also G2/M-phase inhibitors of the mammalian cell cycle. To demonstrate the merits of this bioassay, the effects of protein kinase inhibitors isolated from actinomycetes were investigated. RK-286C and RK-1409, which are structurally related to staurosporine, inhibited cell cycle progression at the G2 phase in both G2-synchronized and nonsynchronized cultures of tsF210 cells. Another kinase inhibitor, sangivamycin, inhibited cell cycle progression at the G2 phase of cells released from temperature arrest but did not inhibit that of the exponentially growing cells. Using the bioassay system, we carried out screening of the cell cycle inhibitors from the microbial metabolites and have discovered several new inhibitors, including novel compounds such as tryprostatins A, B and acetophthalidin. Thus, this bioassay allowed for the detection of cell cycle inhibitors and provided a convenient and useful method for the screening of new inhibitors from the microbial metabolites.",NA,"Actinobacteria animal cell *antineoplastic activity bioassay breast carcinoma *cell cycle cell cycle G1 phase cell cycle G2 phase cell line cell mutant cell structure cell synchronization conference paper controlled study DNA content drug isolation drug screening female fermentation flow cytometry fungus microscopy mouse nonhuman technique temperature *4' demethylamino 4' hydroxystaurosporine/an [Drug Analysis] *4' demethylamino 4' hydroxystaurosporine/cm [Drug Comparison] *4' demethylamino 4' hydroxystaurosporine/dv [Drug Development] *4' demethylamino 4' hydroxystaurosporine/pd [Pharmacology] acetophthalidin/an [Drug Analysis] acetophthalidin/cm [Drug Comparison] acetophthalidin/dv [Drug Development] acetophthalidin/pd [Pharmacology] cycloheximide/cm [Drug Comparison] cycloheximide/pd [Pharmacology] dactinomycin/cm [Drug Comparison] dactinomycin/pd [Pharmacology] fumitremorgin C/cm [Drug Comparison] fumitremorgin C/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] gliotoxin/cm [Drug Comparison] gliotoxin/pd [Pharmacology] hydroxyurea/cm [Drug Comparison] hydroxyurea/pd [Pharmacology] nocodazole/cm [Drug Comparison] nocodazole/pd [Pharmacology] *protein kinase inhibitor/cm [Drug Comparison] *protein kinase inhibitor/dv [Drug Development] *protein kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] rk 1409/an [Drug Analysis] rk 1409/cm [Drug Comparison] rk 1409/dv [Drug Development] rk 1409/pd [Pharmacology] sangivamycin/cm [Drug Comparison] sangivamycin/pd [Pharmacology] staurosporine/cm [Drug Comparison] staurosporine/pd [Pharmacology] tautomycin/cm [Drug Comparison] tautomycin/pd [Pharmacology] tryptostatin a/an [Drug Analysis] tryptostatin a/cm [Drug Comparison] tryptostatin a/dv [Drug Development] tryptostatin a/pd [Pharmacology] tryptostatin b/an [Drug Analysis] tryptostatin b/cm [Drug Comparison] tryptostatin b/dv [Drug Development] tryptostatin b/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","193-203","5","1997",-1

"2721","2868"," P. Greenwald","Cancer risk factors for selecting cohorts for large-scale chemoprevention trials","Many anticipate that application of findings in molecular genetics will help to achieve greater precision in defining high-risk populations that may benefit from chemopreventive interventions. We must recognize, however, that genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and complex gene-environment interactions are all likely to be risk determinants for most cancers. Cohort studies of twins and cancer indicate that having 'identical' genes is generally not a very accurate predictor of cancer incidence. Data from twin studies support the suggestion that environmental factors such as tobacco use significantly influence cancer risk. The complexities of the genetic contribution to disease risk are exemplified by the development of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in only one of monozygotic twin girls, hypothesized to be the result of X chromosome inactivation, with the distribution patterns of the X chromosome being skewed to the female X in the manifesting twin and to the male X in the normal twin. Evidence from transgenic and genetic- environmental studies in animals support the possibility of genetic- environmental interactions. Calorie restriction modifies tumor expression in p53 knockout mice; a high-fat, low-calcium, low-vitamin D diet increases prepolyphyperplasia formation in Apc-mutated mice; and calorie restriction early in life influences development of obesity in the genetically obese Zucker rat (fata). Such environmental modulation of gene expression suggests that chemoprevention has the potential to reduce risk for both environmentally and genetically determined cancers. In view of the growing research efforts in chemoprevention, the NCl has developed a Prevention Trials Decision Network (PTDN) to formalize the evaluation and approval process for large scale chemoprevention trials. The PTDN addresses large trial prioritization and the associated issues of minority recruitment and retention; identification and validation of biomarkers as intermediate endpoints for cancer; and chemopreventive agent selection and development. A comprehensive database is being established to support the PTDN's decision making process and will help to determine which agents investigated in preclinical and early phase clinical trials should move to large-scale testing. Cohorts for large-scale chemoprevention trials include individuals who are determined to be at high risk as a result of genetic predisposition, carcinogenic exposure, or the presence of biomarkers indicative of increased risk. Current large scale trials in well-defined, high-risk populations include the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (tamoxifen), the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (finasteride), and the N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4- HPR) breast cancer prevention study being conducted in Milan. Biomarker studies will provide valuable information for refining the design and facilitating the implementation of future large-scale trials. For example, potential biomarkers are being assessed at biopsy in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The women are then randomized to either placebo, tamoxifen, 4-HPR, or tamoxifen plus 4-HPR for 2-4 weeks, at which time surgery is performed and the biomarkers reassessed to determine biomarker modulation by the interventions. For prostate cancer, modulation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) by 4-HPR and difluoromethylornithine is being investigated; similar studies are being planned for oltipraz, dehydroepiandrosterone, and vitamin E plus selenomethionine. The validation of biomarkers as surrogate endpoints for cancer incidence in high-risk cohorts will allow more agents to be evaluated in shorter studies that use fewer subjects to achieve the desired statistical power.",NA,"*breast cancer/di [Diagnosis] *breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] cancer incidence *cancer risk chemoprophylaxis clinical trial decision making female gene expression regulation human human cell human tissue major clinical study male meta analysis molecular genetics mouse nonhuman phase 2 clinical trial phase 3 clinical trial priority journal *prostate cancer/di [Diagnosis] *prostate cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] review risk factor acetylsalicylic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] alpha tocopherol/dt [Drug Therapy] carbenoxolone/ct [Clinical Trial] colecalciferol/ct [Clinical Trial] eflornithine/ct [Clinical Trial] eflornithine/dt [Drug Therapy] *fenretinide/ct [Clinical Trial] *fenretinide/dt [Drug Therapy] *finasteride/ct [Clinical Trial] *finasteride/dt [Drug Therapy] genistein/ct [Clinical Trial] glycyrrhetinic acid/ct [Clinical Trial] ibuprofen/ct [Clinical Trial] oltipraz/dt [Drug Therapy] piroxicam/ct [Clinical Trial] prasterone/dt [Drug Therapy] selenomethionine/dt [Drug Therapy] *tamoxifen/ct [Clinical Trial] *tamoxifen/dt [Drug Therapy] *tumor marker/ec [Endogenous Compound]","29-36","63","1996",-1

In-vitro isometric contraction studies were performed with longitudinal strips of human pregnant myometrium in the presence and absence of the protein kinase C inhibitors, staurosporine and RO 31-8220, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. Phospholipase D activity was measured by employing the transphosphatidylation reaction. Staurosporine significantly reduced oxytocin-stimulated contractile activity with mean activity reduced by > 50% following the addition of 10-6 M staurosporine (P < 0.01), while addition of 10-5 M resulted in a measured mean contractile activity of ~10% of the control (P < 0.001, n = 5). Similarly, uterine activity was minimal with oxytocin application following incubation with RO 31-8220, mean contractile activity being reduced by ~40% by the addition of 10-7 M RO 31-8220 (P < 0.05) and by ~87% by the addition Of either 10-6 or 10-5 M (P < 0.01, n = 3).

Oxytocin evoked phospholipase D activation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in cultured human pregnant myometrial cells (n = 4).

The effects of 9-cis-RA required protein and RNA synthesis, but were not mediated by factors secreted by stimulated cells or by direct cell contact and did not require serum. These 9-cis-RA-induced morphological effects were completely reversed by growing cells in 50 muM Ca2+, suggesting a mechanism involving a 9-cis-RA-induced increase in Ca2+- dependent adhesion. Consistent with this, beta-catenin protein levels were markedly elevated in the 9-cis-RA-treated cells, and beta-catenin became localized to a Triton-insoluble pool at regions of cell-cell contact. No change could be detected in beta-catenin steady state messenger RNA levels, but 9-cis-RA did increase beta-catenin protein stability. Treatment of cells with low calcium medium did not prevent the 9-cis-RA-induced increase in total beta- catenin protein, but did prevent its movement to a Triton-insoluble pool at the cell membrane. Among several kinase inhibitors, only the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine and the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindoylmaleimide reversed the morphological changes induced by 9-cis-RA. Like treatment with low calcium medium, these inhibitors did not prevent the 9-cis-RA-induced increase in total beta-catenin protein levels, but completely prevented the movement of beta-catenin to the cell membrane. These results point to a role for beta-catenin and serine kinase activity in mediating the action of 9-cis-RA in epithelial differentiation.",NA,"article breast cancer cancer cell culture *cell adhesion controlled study enzyme activity human human cell priority journal *protein localization *protein stability RNA synthesis 1alpha,25 dihydroxy 16 ene 23 yne 26,27 hexafluorocholecalciferol/pd [Pharmacology] 26,26,26,27,27,27!hexafluoro 9,10 secocholesta 5,7,10(19),16 tetraene 23 yne 1,3,25 triol 4 (5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 5,5,8,8 tetramethyl 2 anthryl)benzoic acid/pd [Pharmacology] alitretinoin/cb [Drug Combination] alitretinoin/pd [Pharmacology] *beta catenin/ec [Endogenous Compound] bisindolylmaleimide/pd [Pharmacology] *calcium calpastatin colecalciferol derivative/pd [Pharmacology] cycloheximide/cb [Drug Combination] cycloheximide/pd [Pharmacology] dactinomycin/cb [Drug Combination] dactinomycin/pd [Pharmacology] genistein/cb [Drug Combination] genistein/pd [Pharmacology] heparin/cb [Drug Combination] heparin/pd [Pharmacology] herbimycin/cb [Drug Combination] herbimycin/pd [Pharmacology] *ligand/pd [Pharmacology] *matrigel okadaic acid/pd [Pharmacology] protein kinase inhibitor/cb [Drug Combination] protein kinase inhibitor/pd [Pharmacology] *protein serine kinase/ec [Endogenous Compound] retinoic acid/pd [Pharmacology] retinoic acid receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] *retinoid/pd [Pharmacology] retinoid X receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound] ro 24 5531 sri 1217/pd [Pharmacology] staurosporine/cb [Drug Combination] staurosporine/pd [Pharmacology] suramin/cb [Drug Combination] suramin/pd [Pharmacology] transforming growth factor beta1/pd [Pharmacology] unclassified drug","3265-3273","137","1996",-1

In the female population, the immediate symptoms of menopause include irregular periods, painful sexual intercourse due to vaginal dryness, hot flushes and night sweats (2). Lack of oestrogen also leads to the risk of developing osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. In this report, the authors will mainly discuss the effects of hormone therapy (HT) in menopausal women.

To investigate a possible cooperation between PAF and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in this cell line, the effect of PAF on insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) production as well as binding and biological activities of IGF-I, IGF-II, and the analog Des(1-3)IGF-I have been evaluated. Analysis of self- and cross- displacement curves of [125I]IGF-I binding to HEC-1A cells indicates the presence of a single class of binding sites, with affinity constants of 1-4 nM for IGF-I and IGF-II and 70 nM for Des(13)IGF-I, which binds to IGFBPs with lower affinity. Insulin does not apparently bind to this binding site. Moreover, the addition of increasing concentrations of IGF-I leads to a paradoxical increase of binding. These results indicate a similarity of this binding site to IGFBPs. The presence of IGFBPs has been demonstrated by Western ligand blot analysis of HEC-1A conditioned medium which shows the presence of two bands of 32-34 and 40-45 kDa. By Western immunoblotting analysis, the two bands were respectively identified as IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3. Incubation with PAF (1 muM) highly increases the release of the two IGFBPs from the cells. Such an effect is inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist L659,989, by the PKC inhibitor sangivamycin, and by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. PAF also induces a time-dependent increase of mRNA expression for IGFBP-3, suggesting an effect on synthesis of this protein. IGF-I and IGF-II (0.1-100 nM) are almost ineffective in inducing [3H]thymidine incorporation, whereas a slight proliferative effect is observed with Des(1-3)IGF-I which also increases PAF synthesis. These data demonstrate a modulatory action of PAF on IGFBP secretion in HEC-1A cells and indicate that the IGF system plays a minor, if any, modulatory role on proliferation of this cell line.",NA,"article binding affinity cancer cell culture *cancer growth cell proliferation controlled study *endometrium carcinoma female human human cell priority journal uterus growth insulin somatomedin B somatomedin binding protein *somatomedin binding protein 2 *somatomedin binding protein 3 somatomedin C *thrombocyte activating factor","333-340","61","1996",-1

Orthovanadate or H2O2 added alone had no effect. Pretreatment of myometrium with two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, namely genistein and tyrphostin 47 (at 100 muM), reduced pervanadate-stimulated inositol phosphate formation by 50%. Pervanadate induced a time-sequential formation of inositol phosphates in the order inositol trisphosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol monophosphate. The inhibitory effect of genistein was observed at the level of the three inositol phosphates. Pervanadate induced contraction of the myometrium; the response was dose dependent. H2O2 or orthovanadate was without effect. Pervanadate-mediated contraction was inhibited (50%) by genistein and tyrphostin 47 (100 muM). Western blot analysis, using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, revealed that phosphorylated proteins were present in detergent extracts from pervanadate-stimulated myometrium. Tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced by a preincubation with 100 muM genistein or tyrphostin 47. Phospholipase C-1 was immunodetected in myometrial extracts and was identified as one of the substrates subject to tyrosine phosphorylation following pervanadate treatment.

Human breast cancer T47D cells have a luminal phenotype and are growth-inhibited by retinoids, a class of compounds known to regulate cytokeratin expression. To extend our knowledge of retinoid action in breast cancer, we have studied the retinoid regulation of cytokeratin expression in the T47D model. We found that retinoid inhibition of T47D cell growth was accompanied by increases in K8, K18 and K19 mRNA steady-state levels (Northern blot analysis). The effect on K8 was studied in greater detail. This effect was seen with as low as 1 nM all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) and was maximal (up to 7 fold over control) with 1 muM tRA (the highest dose tested). Time-course studies revealed a detectable effect at 1 h and a maximal effect at 8-24 h. Non-retinoidal growth inhibitors (tamoxifen, BrcAMP and genistein) did not modulate K8 expression, demonstrating that the effect of tRA was specific. K8 mRNA upregulation was blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, suggesting, in accordance with other studies, that tRA exerted a transcriptional effect that was secondary to de novo protein synthesis. Five retinoids known to activate retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and/or retinoid X receptor (RXR) - tRA; 9-cis-retinoic acid, 9cRA; 13-cis RA, 13cRA; retinyl acetate; and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide 4HPR - inhibited T47D cell growth and increased K8 expression, whereas an arotinoid (Re-40-8757) that is not a RAR activator caused growth inhibition but did not upregulate K8. Activation of RARalpha contributed to K8 upregulation, since this effect was partially blocked by the RARalpha-selective antagonist Re-41-5253. Analogous results were obtained throughout when blots were reprobed with K18 cDNA. Western blot and immunocytochemistry experiments demonstrated that protein levels of K8 and K18 increased by 2 days of treatment with 1 muM tRA.

The mother's diet is the source of human milk trans fatty acids, and since these fatty acids are prevalent in many common foods of the Canadian diet, the trans fatty acid content and the fatty acid composition of Canadian human milk were measured by gas liquid chromatography coupled with silver nitrate thin layer chromatography. In samples obtained from 198 lactating mothers across Canada, the average percentage of total trans (sum of t18:1, t18:2, and t18:3) was 7.2% of breast milk fatty acids with a range of 0.1-17.2%. Analysis of t18:1 isomer distribution indicated that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are the major source of these trans fatty acids in human milk, whereas contribution from dairy products appeared to be relatively minor. Linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid levels were inversely related to the total trans fatty acids, indicating that the elevation of trans fatty acids in Canadian human milk is at the expense of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids. Levels of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids did not correlate with their parent fatty acids, indicating that it might be difficult to elevate the levels of n-6 and n-3 C20-22 polyunsaturated fatty acids in breast milk by increasing levels of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids in the mother's diet.",NA,"*breast milk conference paper *diet female *food gas liquid chromatography human mother thin layer chromatography arachidonic acid docosahexaenoic acid essential fatty acid *fatty acid linoleic acid linolenic acid oleic acid *omega 3 fatty acid *omega 6 fatty acid polyunsaturated fatty acid silver nitrate soybean oil stearic acid vegetable oil","S279-S282","31","1996",-1

However, betulin and pinosylvin, available in sufficient amounts for in vivo testing, did not induce the expression of the vitellogenin gene. Differences in the primary sequences of human and fish estrogen receptors (hormone as well as DNA-binding regions) or uptake and metabolism of the compounds may explain the discrepancy between the two estrogen bioassays.

In addition, elevated src family kinase activity is present in a percentage of these neoplasms and has been implicated in signal transduction in these cells. Therefore, inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity is a potential approach for treating these tumors. Utilizing the SKBR3 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, we evaluated the effects of broadly targeting growth factor receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (herbimycin A and genistein) to inhibit proliferation. We also evaluated these inhibitors' effects on proteins that regulate ras function, which is a convergence point for signaling through both src family kinases and a number of growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (e.g., epidermal growth factor and erbB-2 receptors). We specifically evaluated whether these compounds affected 2 recently discovered proteins involved in controlling ras function: Shc, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated by src and activated growth factor receptors, and Grb-2, which mediates signal transduction from activated growth factor receptors through ras. We evaluated their effects on tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, binding of Grb-2 to She and MBP kinase activity. Both cell lines were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by each compound. This was accompanied by decreased She tyrosine phosphorylation. She's association with Grb-2 and MAP kinase activity.

Many of these proteins can be secreted by mesangial cells. In the current study, gene regulation of a rat matrix metalloproteinase, interstitial collagenase and its tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), was investigated by Northern blot analysis. Stimulation of rat mesangial cell (RMC) collagenase by interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) produced an increase (>45-fold) in mRNA which peaked at 12 h. Lesser effects on the TIMP-1 mRNA expression were observed in response to IL-1beta. Indomethacin did not influence the effect of IL-1beta on collagenase, and exogenous prostaglandin E2 had no significant effect either on basal or IL-1beta-stimulated mRNA levels. Collagenase was secreted into the media and showed minimal gelatinolytic activity at 36-h stimulation with IL- 1beta by zymography. By Western immunoblotting, we demonstrated with 24 h of stimulation the secretion of the active form of collagenase, which further increased after 36 h with IL-1beta compared with the control. When RMC were retreated with genistein and herbimycin A, both inhibited collagenase mRNA induction by IL-1beta. These data suggest that IL-1beta stimulates interstitial collagenase synthesis and activation and that a tyrosine kinase pathway is involved in the signal transduction mechanisms and is not dependent on endogenous prostaglandin biosynthesis. Recently, a third interstitial collagenase (collagenase-3) has been identified from breast carcinoma. This cDNA is 84% identical to the rat interstitial collagenase cDNA probe we have utilized in this study and thus may represent the rat homologue of the human collagenase-3 now called matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13.",NA,"animal cell article enzyme activity enzyme release extracellular matrix gene expression regulation interstitium male *mesangium cell nonhuman priority journal protein secretion rat *collagenase *interleukin 1beta","F831-F837","269","1995",-1

We have studied estrogenicity and antiestrogenicity of dietary soy and two phyloestrogens, coumestrol and daidzein, in our neoDES mouse model for the study of prostatic neoplasia. Soy was chosen because it is rich in phytoestrogens, is widely used in Oriental diets, and has antiestrogenic and anticarcinogenic properties in the neoDES mouse when given from fertilization onward. In short-term tests with adult animals, no evidence for estrogenicity or antiestrogenicity (capability to antagonize the action of 17beta-estradiol) of soy was found when development of epithelial metaplasia and expression of c-fos protooncogene in prostate were used as end points of estrogen action. Estrogenic activity of coumestrol and daidzein on c-fos expression was subtle. Coumestrol, either given alone or in combination with 17beta-estradiol, had no effect on development of epithelial metaplasia. These marginal or missing effects in adult males could be interpreted by assuming that the neonatal period is more critical for estrogenic or antiestrogenic action of soy and phytoestrogens. Once initiated, estrogen-related lesions would develop spontaneously.

The precursors of the biologically active compounds originate in soybean products (mainly isoflavonoids), whole grain cereal food, seeds, and probably berries and nuts (mainly lignans). The plant lignan and isoflavonoid glycosides are converted by intestinal bacteria to hormonelike compounds with weak estrogenic but also antioxidative activity; they have now been shown to influence not only sex hormone metabolism and biological activity but also intracellular enzymes, protein synthesis, growth factor action, malignant cell proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis in a way that makes them strong candidates for a role as natural cancer-protective compounds.

Expressed hM-PST was very similar to the brain, intestinal, and platelet forms of the enzyme in its physical, immunological, and kinetic properties. The ability of hM-PST to sulfate a number of xenobiotics was examined and compared with the bacterially expressed human phenol-sulfating form of PST (hP-PST). The translation product of the T47D hM-PST cDNA was 92% identical to that of liver hP-PST. Monoamine neurotransmittors, such as epinephrine and dopamine, were maximally conjugated at lower concentrations by expressed hM-PST (2 and 20 muM, respectively) than by hP-PST (1 and 1 mM, respectively). In contrast, simple phenols-such as p-nitrophenol, acetaminophen, and alpha-naphthol-were maximally conjugated at lower concentrations (4 muM, 20 muM, and 0.5 muM, respectively) by hP-PST than by hM-PST(1 mM, 1.5 mM, and 50 muM, respectively). Minoxidil was sulfated at similar rates and concentrations (7 mM) by both forms of PST. None of the estrogens or related compounds, such as beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol, equilenin, or genistein tested as substrates were sulfated by hM-PST; however, all of these compounds were substrates for hP-PST. As with hP-PST, the hydroxysteroids dehydroepiandrosterone and cortisol were not sulfated by hM-PST. In addition, inhibition studies suggest that the amino acid differences between hM-PST and hP-PST are of adequate significance to prevent compounds with a sterol-like structure from binding the active site of hM-PST. These results indicate that there are important differences in the substrate reactivities of the two PSTs and that expression of the individual human STs in bacteria is a valuable tool for the investigation of differences in drug and xenobiotic metabolism.",NA,"article breast carcinoma DNA library drug conjugation *drug sulfation enzyme active site Escherichia coli gene expression human human tissue nonhuman priority journal 1 naphthol 4 nitrophenol adrenalin *aryl sulfotransferase complementary DNA diethylstilbestrol dopamine equilenin estradiol ethinylestradiol genistein hydrocortisone minoxidil monoamine paracetamol phenol derivative prasterone","945-950","23","1995",-1

This study investigated the genotoxicity of these soya isoflavones and their interactions with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) in bone marrow cells and DNA adduct formations in liver and mammary glands of mice. Groups of female ICR mice were pretreated i.p. with daidzein and/or genistein (10-20 mg/kg per day for 6 days or 50 mg/kg per 12 h for 3 days) or with the solvent, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The mice were implanted with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) tablets s.c., and treated with DMBA (50 mg/kg) i.p. and colchicine (4 mg/kg) i.p. 24, 23, and 2 h before sacrifice, respectively. In bone marrow cells, DMBA alone induced 11.73 + 1.42 SCE/cell compared to 4.35 + 0.83 SCE/cell in the DMSO treated controls (P = 0.001). DMBA induced 20% fewer SCE (P < 0.05) in mice pretreated with daidzein, genistein or a combination of genistein and daidzein (6 x 20 mg/kg per day for 6 days) when compared to mice that received no pretreatments. Genistein at 50 mg/kg per 12 h for 3 days also inhibited DMBA-induced SCE by 20%. However, treatment for 3 days with 50 mg/kg per 12 h of genistein or daidzein alone, or a combination of daidzein plus genistein (without DMBA treatment) also induced more SCE than treatment with only the solvent (DMSO, P < 0.05). Pretreatment with both the low and the high doses of daidzein plus genistein or the high dose of genistein reduced the replication index of bone marrow cells when compared to pretreatment with DMSO (P < 0.05). Pretreatment with genistein reduced DMBA-induced DNA adduct formation by 34%, but this was only marginally significant (P = 0.08) due to the large inter-individual variability in adduct levels. These results show that genistein and daidzein suppress SCE and possibly DNA adduct formation induced by the known carcinogen, DMBA.

High grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is considered a precursor lesion for peripheral prostatic adenocarcinoma. The biologic significance of low grade PIN is unknown; however, the likelihood of progression from low to high grade PIN has been suggested. Methods. A battery of nine lectins was applied to paraffin sections from 20 prostatectomies to identify prostatic carcinoma. The patterns of lectin binding were compared among normal/hyperplastic, dysplastic, and malignant glands. The increase in the Ki-67-defined growth fraction was compared with the lectin binding pattern. Results. An aberrant lectin binding pattern, similar to that observed in adenocarcinoma, was observed in PIN for four of the lectins; this distinct staining pattern was found in glands with minimal dysplastic changes and in glands with high grade dysplasia. Specifically, staining for soy bean agglutinin and Ulex europaeus agglutinin was negative in benign and hyperplastic glands and positive in dysplastic glands and carcinoma. Staining for wheat germ agglutinin and peanut agglutinin was weakly positive or negative in normal and hyperplastic glands, whereas it was strongly positive in dysplasia and carcinoma. The staining for Concavalin A. Ricinus communis agglutinin, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, and Lens culinaris agglutinin showed no difference between normal/hyperplastic and dysplastic glands. The aberrant lectin binding already was evident in low grade dysplasia versus the increased Ki-67 defined-growth fraction that was obvious only in high grade dysplasia and carcinoma. Conclusions. These findings suggest that the early dysplastic lesions in the prostate may be part of a continuum in the multistep process leading to invasive carcinoma.",NA,"article cancer grading cancer growth *carcinoma in situ/et [Etiology] clinical article controlled study histochemistry human human tissue *lectin binding male priority journal *prostate adenocarcinoma/et [Etiology] concanavalin A *lectin peanut agglutinin phytohemagglutinin soybean agglutinin tumor antigen/ec [Endogenous Compound] Ulex europaeus agglutinin wheat germ agglutinin","2539-2544","75","1995",-1

Ritter","Organochlorine residues and risk of breast cancer","Considerable attention has recently been focused on the possible role of estrogenic compounds as etiologic agents in the development of human breast cancer. This review summarizes data from relevant laboratory and epidemiological studies to assess the hypothesis that exposure to organochlorines, and specifically 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1- trichloroethane (DDT), increases breast cancer risk. Organochlorine compounds, including pesticides such as DDT and industrial compounds such as the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), have had a long history of use. In general, these compounds are characterized by their high lipophilicity and environmental persistence. DDT was widely used in agriculture and public health programs from 1943 to 1972, when it was removed from use in the Western world. DDT is still used, however, in many developing nations. The International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that there was adequate evidence that DDT was carcinogenic in laboratory animals, yet epidemiological evidence has not been compelling. The estrogenic activity of o,p'-DDT has been well characterized; however, the affinity of estrogen receptors for this compound is very weak and reported to be 1/2,000-1/10,000 that of 17beta-estradiol. Epidemiologically, some investigators have reported elevated levels of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene, a DDT metabolite, and PCBs in breast adipose tissue and blood serum taken from breast cancer patients when compared with controls, while others have reported the absence of such an association. While the etiology of breast cancer is not fully understood, it is generally recognized that estrogenic compounds may increase the risk of disease. Contemporary human exposure to DDT and other organochlorines is very limited and would likely play an insignificant role when compared with other sources of exposure, such as estrogen replacement therapy and phytoestrogens in food.",NA,"adipose tissue article bioaccumulation body burden *breast cancer/ep [Epidemiology] *breast cancer/et [Etiology] cancer risk carcinogenicity environmental exposure estrogen activity estrogen metabolism human lipophilicity nonhuman *chlorphenotane/to [Drug Toxicity] *chlorphenotane/pk [Pharmacokinetics] cytochrome P450/ec [Endogenous Compound] estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen/ec [Endogenous Compound] estrogen receptor polychlorinated biphenyl derivative/to [Drug Toxicity]","71-89","14","1995",-1

The precursors of the biologically active compounds originate in soybean products (mainly isoflavonoids but also lignans), as well as whole grain cereals, seeds, probably berries and nuts (mainly lignans). The plant lignan and isoflavonoid glycosides are converted by intestinal bacteria to hormone-like compounds with weak estrogenic and antioxidative activity; they have now been shown to influence not only sex hormone metabolism and biological activity but also intracellular enzymes, protein synthesis, growth factor action, malignant cell proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis, making them strong candidates for a role as natural cancer protective compounds.

As a result, although existing data suggest that soy protein may be protective for cancer risk, results are overall inconclusive. There is also evidence that soy products may affect risk factors for cancer, such as endogenous hormone levels. Preliminary data from our group indicate that young Adventist women who are vegetarians with high soy intake and a lower risk of breast cancer may have higher levels of an adrenal androgen, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. Other groups have noted that soy protein may be associated with alterations in the regulation and binding of ovarian hormones.

Although this effect of protein source on plasma cholesterol has been shown in many species, the mechanism is not completely understood. This paper reviews the relationship between dietary protein source and plasma thyroxine concentration. The basic premise is that feeding soy protein lowers plasma cholesterol concentration by causing an increase in plasma thyroxine concentrations. The metabolic changes involving cholesterol that occur when soy protein is fed are discussed. These changes are consistent with changes induced by elevating thyroxine. Data are presented from animal studies showing that feeding soy protein to laboratory animals consistently elevates plasma thyroxine concentrations. Furthermore, this elevation in plasma thyroxine concentrations precedes the change in plasma cholesterol concentrations: a necessary requirement for hypothesizing a causative effect. Possible mechanisms as to how a dietary protein source affects plasma thyroxine are also presented.",NA,"cholesterol blood level *cholesterol metabolism conference paper hormonal regulation nonhuman protein intake thyroxine blood level casein *cholesterol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soybean protein *thyroxine/ec [Endogenous Compound]","619S-623S","125","1995",-1

Specifically, in addition to being hypogonadal, these chronically alcohol-abusing men with cirrhosis frequently manifest gynecomastia, palmar erythema, spider angiomata, and a female escutcheon. These physical signs of exposure to active estrogen occur in the presence of normal or only minimally elevated levels of endogenous steroid estrogens. Because levels of circulating steroid hormones failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the feminization observed, alternate explanations were considered. If the estrogenization observed was not entirely a function of tissue expose to steroid estrogens produced endogenously, then perhaps tissues were being exposed to exogenous estrogenic substances from dietary sources. Given the degree of alcohol abuse in the population in which hypotheses for feminization were being formed, alcoholic beverages became a prime candidate as a dietary source of exogenous estrogenic substances.",NA,"*alcohol consumption beer body weight conference paper follitropin blood level gas chromatography human luteinizing hormone blood level mass spectrometry nonhuman uterus weight *alcohol *estrogen derivative estrogen receptor follitropin luteinizing hormone *phytohormone prolactin","98-102","208","1995",-1

These changes were similar, but more pronounced during treatment with 17beta-estradiol, particularly teat circumference. The changes in vulva were more dramatic in May than in November and resembled those observed in ewes treated with estradiol.

Coumestrol, the most potent inhibitor in our experiments, is the best inhibitor of the enzyme known to date. All compounds with inhibitory effects were also estrogenic. However, structural demands for 17beta-HSOR Type 1 inhibition and estrogenicity of tested compounds in breast cancer cells (judged by increased cell proliferation) were not identical. Zearalanone and diethylstilbestrol, both potent estrogens, did not inhibit 17beta-HSOR Type 1. Thus, changes in the estrogen molecule may discriminate between active sites of 17beta-HSOR Type 1 and estrogen binding sites of the ER. The effects of these compounds in vivo cannot be predicted on the basis of these results. Inhibition of 17beta-HSOR Type 1 enzyme could lead to a decrease in the availability of the highly active endogenous estrogen. However, these compounds are estrogenic per se, and they may thus replace endogenous estrogens. Additional studies are needed to further understand the role of these plant estrogens in the etiology of hormone-dependent cancers. It is not easily conceivable how the chemopreventive action of Asian diets, possibly mediated by phytoestrogens in soya products, can be based on the inhibition of estrone reduction at the target cells by phytoestrogens or related compounds, unless they are 'incomplete estrogens' (i.e., unable to induce all effects typical of endogenous estrogens).",NA,"cancer cell culture cell proliferation conference paper enzyme activity *enzyme inhibition estrogen activity hormonal carcinogenesis human human cell *3(or 17)beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase coumestrol diethylstilbestrol estradiol derivative *estrogen derivative estrogen receptor estrone genistein *phytohormone zeranol","51-59","208","1995",-1

Korach","Dietary estrogens act through estrogen receptor-mediated processes and show no antiestrogenicity in cultured breast cancer cells","Dietary estrogens are believed to exert their estrogenic or antiestrogenic (chemopreventive) action in estrogen responsive cells by interacting with the estrogen receptor (ER). The present study was undertaken to evaluate a direct role of ER in estrogenic or antiestrogenic activities of three dietary estrogens (coumestrol, genistein and zearalenone). HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with an expression vector for ER and an estrogen-responsive reporter gene construct. Coumestrol, genistein, and zearalenone all increased the activity of the reporter gene, only in the presence of the ER, and the activation was blocked with the ER antagonist ICI 164,384, demonstrating an ER-specific, agonist response. In addition, in MCF-7 cells, coumestrol and zearalenone increased the expression of the estrogen-responsive pS2 gene. Coumestrol and genistein inhibited the purified estrogen-specific 17beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase enzyme and the conversion of estrone to 17beta-estradiol in T-47D cells, which contain this enzyme. However, they did not inhibit the estrone-induced proliferation of T-47D cells. In conclusion, coumestrol, genistein, and zearalenone are all potent estrogens in vitro, and they act through ER mediated mechanism. Our findings give no evidence to support the idea that these compounds act as antiestrogens through competition for the binding sites of ER or by inhibition of the conversion of estrone to 17beta-estradiol in breast cancer cells, since this effect was nullified by their agonist action on cell proliferation. Therefore, their suggested chemopreventive action in estrogen-related cancers must be mediated through other mechanisms.",NA,"article binding site *breast cancer cancer cell culture cell proliferation cell strain MCF 7 controlled study *dietary intake enzyme inhibition enzyme purification gene activity gene expression genetic transfection HeLa cell human human cell priority journal receptor binding reporter gene antiestrogen coumestrol estradiol/ec [Endogenous Compound] *estrogen *estrogen receptor estrone/ec [Endogenous Compound] genistein hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/ec [Endogenous Compound] n butyl 11 (3,17beta dihydroxyestra 1,3,5(10) trien 7alpha yl) n methylundecanamide zearalenone","572-578","102","1994",-1

Their N-terminal sequences of 22 amino acids determined were identical, and the sequence was homologous (about 60% identical) to the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (EGF) factor 8 (MFG-E8) (Ref. [12], Stubbs, J.D. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, 8417-8421, 1990). This suggests that MGP57/53 are bovine MFGM components 15/16 (PAS-6 and PAS-7), which have recently been reported to be bovine homologs of MFG-E8. N-Glycanase treatment of these glycoproteins reduced their molecular masses, and consequently the enzymatically deglycosylated MGP57 and MGP53 converged on a single band of 50 kDa as measured by SDS-PAGE, indicating that the polypeptide portions of these two distinct glycoprotein antigens are very similar or identical and that their N-linked sugar chains contributed to minor difference in their molecular masses. Western blot analyses using lectins also revealed that they were differentially glycosylated; MGP57 was stained with concanavalin A (Con A) more strongly than MGP53, whereas MGP 53 wits stained well with soybean agglutinin (SBA).

TNF-induced changes in cellular PTPase activity were also examined. Incubation of tumor cells with genistein or tyrphostin, known TK inhibitors, protected against TNF cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner.

Preincubation of tumor cells with sodium orthovanadate, a known PTPase inhibitor, also protected against TNF cytotoxicity only at early time points after addition of TNF. Activation of total cellular PTPase activity by TNF was observed at early times of TNF incubation only in TNF-sensitive cell lines. Immunoblot analysis revealed that TNF enhanced tyrosyl phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) only in TNF-sensitive cell lines. No other substrates were tyr-phosphorylated after addition of TNF.

Proliferation of HSC-41E6, HSC-45M2, and SH101-P4 stomach cancer cell lines was strongly inhibited by biochanin A and genistein, whereas other stomach, esophageal, and colon cancer lines were moderately suppressed by both compounds.

DNA fragmentation was observed at cytotoxic doses of both compounds, indicating the apoptotic mode of cell death by the compounds. Chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation of each cell line were also observed. The advent of apoptosis was dose dependent for both isoflavones. Biochanin A suppressed tumor growth of HSC-45M2 and HSC-41E6 lines in athymic nude mice.

In the present study we investigated whether this differential effect of soybean protein is due to intestinal epithelial cell damage and thus results in a compensating increase in proliferation of epithelial cells. Two groups of six rats were fed purified high fat, low calcium diets, differing only in the type of protein. When compared with casein feeding, soybean protein feeding stimulated the fecal excretion of magnesium, fat and fatty acids, but had no effect on the excretion of bile acids. In fecal water, the concentration of bile acids was lower when soybean protein was fed. In contrast, free fatty acid concentration, as well as luminal cytolytic activity, was higher in fecal water of rats fed soybean protein. Furthermore, epithelial cell damage and proliferation of colonic epithelium (measured as in vivo incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA) were greater in rats fed soybean protein. The stimulation of colonic proliferation by soybean protein is consistent with the observed increase in luminal cytolytic activity and epithelial cell damage. We conclude that the stimulatory effect of soybean protein on endogenous magnesium excretion is due to a soybean protein-specific damage of colonic epithelial cells, which results in a compensatory epithelial cell hyperproliferation.",NA,"animal experiment animal tissue article bile acid metabolism cell damage cell proliferation *colon mucosa controlled study *cytolysis enzyme activity feces male nonhuman priority journal protein content *protein diet rat alkaline phosphatase *casein lipid magnesium/ec [Endogenous Compound] *soybean protein","1709-1713","123","1993",-1

Fermentable soy fiber may maintain fecal bulk and prevent mucosal atrophy. We therefore compared the effects of Enrich (containing soy fiber) with Ensure (fiber-free) on mucosal mass, fecal bile acids, and cell proliferation in the rat. Sprague- Dawley rats (n = 20) were randomized into groups receiving either standard rat food, Enrich, or Ensure. After 4 weeks, rats were weighed and killed at intervals after administration of vincristine sulfate (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally), which was given to induce metaphase arrest within the intestinal crypts and to allow calculation of crypt cell production rate. Fecal free bile acids and neutral steroids were analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Nucleic acid concentrations in the small and large intestine and crypt cell production rate in the small bowel were unaffected by diet. In the proximal large bowel, both enteral diets produced a marked reduction in crypt cell production rate to values only 5% to 7.5% of control values (p < .001). In the midcolon of rats fed Ensure, there was a similar reduction, but this hypoplastic effect was completely prevented by Enrich. Without an elevation in the lithocolic acid to deoxycholic acid ratio, secondary bile acid concentrations were increased in rats receiving Enrich (p < .05 to .01) but not in those receiving Ensure.

HGF is present in normal serum and increases following liver injury or partial hepatectomy. In addition to liver, HGF mRNA has been detected in kidney. In cultured rabbit proximal tubule cells, recombinant human HGF (10-10 M) increased DNA synthesis, measured as [3H] thymidine incorporation, from 1345 + 213 to 2931 + 636 cpm/106 cells; n = 9; p < 0.005). HGF was found to exert mitogenic effects at lower concentrations than epidermal growth factor (EGF), with half maximal effects seen at 6 x 10-11 M compared to 7 x 10-10 M for EGF. HGF was additive with EGF in stimulating [3H] thymidine incorporation. In addition to rabbit proximal tubule cells, HGF increased proliferation in a cultured mouse proximal tubule cell line, MCT, and in rat glomerular epithelial cells. In contrast, HGF did not stimulate proliferation of either rat mesangial cells or a rat aortic smooth muscle cell line, A7r5. The HGF receptor is the product of the c-met protooncogene. C-met mRNA was detected in total kidney and in cultured proximal tubule cells but was not detected in cultured mesangial cells. In contrast, HGF mRNA was detected in mesangial cells but not in cultured proximal tubule cells. Preincubation of rabbit proximal tubule cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (50 muM), prevented HGF-stimulation of [3H] thymidine incorporation. In LiCl pretreated rabbit proximal tubule cells loaded with [3H] myoinositol, HGF increased total inositol phosphate release, measured by anion exchange chromatography (control: 2181 + 414 vs HGF: 2609 + 478 cpm/106 cells; n = 6; p < 0.05). Although genistein did not affect baseline phosphoinositide hydrolysis, it inhibited the HGF stimulation. Thus, HGF is mitogenic for cultured proximal tubule cells as well as glomerular epithelial cells.

In addition, a case of estrogen contamination due to the shedding of estrogenic xenobiotics by polystyrene labware was solved using this assay. This bioassay has the following advantages over those currently used: a) it is easy to perform: it requires a standard cell culture facility and a human estrogen-sensitive cell line; b) it is relevant to humans, since it relies on the responses of a human cell line growing in human serum-supplemented media, and c) it is sensitive since it detects 10pg/ml estradiol-17beta. This assay may also be used to determine the presence of estrogenic xenobiotics in soil, water, human foods and animal feeds.

The binding of lectins to goblet cell mucins and other glycoconjugates changes as the cells migrate and differentiate. Additional stepwise modifications in glycoconjugate expression occur in premalignant and malignant neoplasms that may be detected by lectin binding studies. The lectins Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) and soybean agglutinin (SBA) have been developed as markers of differentiation in normal-appearing colonic epithelium. Using a quantitative biometric system to score tissues, reduced levels of lectin binding have been found in rectal tissue from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. The lectin Amaranthus caudatus agglutinin (ACA) binds to a cytoplasmic glycoconjugate expressed at the base of the colonic crypt and serves as a possible proliferation marker in the distal, but not proximal, colon. ACA binding increases in tandem with increased levels of proliferation (using BrdU incorporation) in neoplastic tissues. Binding by the peanut lectin (PNA) occurs late in the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence - in larger adenomas and in cancers - and serves as a marker of advancing neoplasia.

L86-8275 [(-)cis-5,7-dihydroxy- 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-8[4-(3-hydroxy-1-methyl)-piperidinyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4- one] is a flavone of novel structure. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine in vitro whether L86-8275 is a more potent inhibitor of growth in breast carcinoma and lung carcinoma cells than quercetin or genistein. Methods: We studied the effects of L86-8275 on cell growth in seven breast carcinoma cell lines and five lung carcinoma cell lines. MDA468 breast carcinoma was then selected for further study. Cell proliferation was measured by a colorimetric dye reduction assay; synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein by incorporation of the radioactive metabolic precursors thymidine, uridine, or leucine, respectively; adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content by a luciferase-mediated bioluminescence reaction; and cell cycle progression by the use of cell-synchronizing drugs (aphidicolin and nocodazole) and flow cytometry. Results: L86-8275 was not cytotoxic to stationary-phase cells but reversibly inhibited the growth of cells in exponential growth phase. At concentrations of 25-160 nM, L86-8275 inhibited growth of human breast and lung carcinoma cell lines by 50%. MDA468 breast carcinoma cells were 60-fold and 400-fold more sensitive to L86-8275 than to quercetin and genistein, respectively. By 24 hours after addition of L86-8275, DNA synthesis in MDA468 cells was inhibited by greater than 95%, protein synthesis by 80%, and RNA synthesis by 40%-60%, under conditions that preserved cellular ATP levels at approximately 80%-90% of control values. When MDA468 cells released from aphidicolin-induced cell cycle arrest were exposed to 200 nM L86-8275, they completed the S phase but arrested in G2. When cells released from nocodazole-induced cell cycle arrest were exposed to 200 nM L86-8275, they completed mitosis but arrested in G1. Conclusions: L86-8275 is a potent, yet reversible, growth-inhibitory flavone that can selectively block cell cycle progression in vitro at more than one point in the cell cycle. Implications: These findings suggest that L86-8275 is a candidate for further preclinical development, as well as a model for the synthesis of other flavonoids that might potently delay cell cycle progression to achieve inhibition of tumor growth.

Gapor","The effect of vitamin E tocotrienols from palm oil on chemically induced mammary carcinogenesis in female rats","In the DMBA induced rat mammary tumor model, palm oil appeared to be less tumourigenic than corn oil, soybean oil, beef tallow and lard. Palm oil is a rich source of tocotrienols which have been reported to have antitumour activity against certain types of transplantable murine tumors. Results of the present experiments showed that palm oil stripped of its vitamin E tocopherols and tocotrienols (EFPO) enhanced tumorigenesis compared to palm oil containing vitamin E. In view of this a second experiment was designed to determine whether addition of a tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) of palm oil to corn oil was able to inhibit development of mammary tumors in the DMBA treated rat model. One hundred female Sprague Dawley rats at 50 days of age were treated with a single dose of 5 mg of DMBA. They were then divided into 5 groups and fed semi-synthetic diets containing 20% by weight (40 en%) of either corn oil (CO), refined bleached and deodorized palm oil (RBDPO), corn oil + 500 ppm TRF, corn oil + 1000 ppm TRF or CO + 135 ppm alpha-tocopherol. The experiment was terminated 5 months after DMBA treatment. The RBD palm oil group had the lowest tumor incidence, tumor count and tumors per rat compared to animals fed the CO diet. This suggests that CO has a greater tumor promoting effect than palm oil. Supplementation of TRF at 500 ppm to corn oil did not provide protection. However at the higher concentration of 1000 ppm of TRF, the corn oil fed animals had significantly greater median latency period, lower tumor incidence and tumor count than the corn oil fed group as well as the group supplemented with either 500 ppm of TRF or 135 ppm alpha- tocopherol. The results appear to indicate that supplementation of corn oil with adequate amounts of TRF may give some protection against the cancer promoting effect of corn oil. The results also suggest that the favourable effects observed on a palm oil diet maybe attributed to the presence of naturally occurring tocotrienols in palm oil.",NA,"animal experiment animal model animal tissue *antineoplastic activity article *breast carcinogenesis/et [Etiology] *breast carcinogenesis/pc [Prevention] cancer incidence *diet supplementation dose response fat intake female lipid composition nonhuman oral drug administration priority journal rat tumor model tumor promotion vitamin blood level *vitamin intake *alpha tocopherol *alpha tocotrienol/do [Drug Dose] corn oil dimethylbenz[a]anthracene lard *palm oil soybean oil","879-892","12","1992",-1

"2849","3011"," M. E. Baker","Evolution of regulation of steroid-mediated intercellular communication in vertebrates: Insights from flavonoids, signals that mediate plant-rhizobia symbiosis","Various flavonoids, such as genistein, luteolin, and coumestrol, have actions in mammals that are mediated by binding either to classical estrogen receptors or to type II receptors, which also bind estrogen. These actions are of intense interest because they may be the basis for the protective actions of plants against certain cancers, such as breast cancer. The biological activity of flavonoids in mammals raises some questions. Is the hormonal action of flavonoids 'an accident' derived from their phenolic groups and general hydrophobicity, which gives them some properties in common with estrogens? Or do flavonoids regulate gene transcription in other organisms? And, if so, is there a connection between their actions in these organisms and in mammals? Some answers to these questions are provided by the actions of plant-derived flavonoids in regulating gene transcription in rhizobia, bacteria that form nitrogen-fixing nodules in the roots of legumes, which has several interesting similarities with steroid-mediated actions in vertebrates. First, there is specificity in the actions of flavonoids in rhizobia; oxidation or reduction of the flavonoid or removal of a hydroxyl group can alter its biological activity. Moreover, some flavonoids are anti-inducers functioning like steroid antagonists to negate the actions of inducers. Also there are sequence similarities between various steroid metabolizing enzymes and proteins found in rhizobia, which indicates that these proteins are derived from a common ancestor. For example, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the interconversion of the alcohol and ketone a C17 on estrogens and androgens, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the interconversion of the alcohol and ketone at C11 of glucocorticoids, and 3alpha,20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the interconversion of the alcohol and ketone at C20 of corticosteroids, are homologs of proteins found in rhizobia. Thus, the binding of flavonoids to vertebrate proteins may represent an evolutionary linkage between the actions of steroids in mammals and communication between plants and rhizobia.",NA,"*cell communication conference paper *evolution nonhuman *plant priority journal *Rhizobium *signal transduction *symbiosis *coumestrol/cm [Drug Comparison] *coumestrol/pd [Pharmacology] *diethylstilbestrol/cm [Drug Comparison] *diethylstilbestrol/pd [Pharmacology] *estrogen receptor *flavonoid/cm [Drug Comparison] *flavonoid/pd [Pharmacology] *genistein/cm [Drug Comparison] *genistein/pd [Pharmacology] *hydroxytamoxifen/cm [Drug Comparison] *hydroxytamoxifen/pd [Pharmacology] *luteolin/cm [Drug Comparison] *luteolin/pd [Pharmacology]","301-308","41","1992",-1

An endoprotease capable of cleaving a dynorphin peptide at the monobasic processing site is secreted from the rat anterior pituitary lactotrophic cell line, GH4C1. When characterized by fast protein liquid chromatography using an ion exchange column, the majority of the endoprotease activity elutes as a single symmetrical peak around 0.3 M NaCl. The protease inhibitor profile suggests that the activity is due to putative thiol protease. These enzymatic properties are similar to a monobasic processing enzyme previously found in bovine pituitary and in the rat brain. The secretory pathway which contains the enzyme activity in GH4C1 cells was characterized by stimulation of secretion by thyrotropin releasing hormone, forskolin, phorbol ester, or potassium chloride. The secretion of the enzyme activity was substantially increased by these compounds suggesting that the GH4C1 cells secrete the activity via the regulated pathway. A hormonal treatment of the GH4C1 cells which has been previously shown to produce a substantial increase in the number of secretory granules and ir-prolactin has been found in this study to elevate this enzyme activity 2-fold.

They had differential inhibitory effects (NDGA > equol > enterolactone > enterodiol) on the binding of estrone and estradiol to rat AFP and the binding of unsaturated fatty acid to both rat and human AFP. Inhibition was dose-dependent. The apparent dissociation constants (K(d)) for phytoestrogens binding to AFP were: K(d) NDGA = 5 + 1.2 10-7 M, K(d) equol = 6.7 + 0.8 10-6 M, K(d) enterolactone = 1.7 + 0.4 10-5 M and K(d) enterodiol = 2.2 + 0.6 10-5 M. The K(d) for estrone binding to rat AFP was increased by increasing concentrations of equol, but the number of estrone binding sites remained unchanged. This, plus the results of double-reciprocal plots, suggests that they compete for the same site(s). NDGA also competitively inhibited estrone binding at low NDGA concentrations (increased K(d)), but high concentrations induced conformational changes in rat AFP, as both K(d) and the number of binding sites (n) were altered. Both rat and human AFPs underwent changes in electrophoretic behaviour and loss of immunoreactivity with increasing NDGA, suggesting that NDGA binding induces conformational changes in the AFPs. However, equol did not alter the electrophoretic or immunological properties of either rat or human AFP, providing further evidence for qualitative differences in the effects of these diphenols.

Furthermore, the in vivo apparent digestibility of the different fiber sources was tested using a mobile nylon bag technique in intestine-cannulated pigs. Estradiol-17beta (E2) bound more strongly to the various fibers than did estrone (E1), estriol or estrone-3-glucuronide.

Linseed (91%), oats (83%), barley chaff (88%) and wheat bran (82%) are other excellent binders of E2. Corn, rye and white wheat flour showed lower binding capacity with a relatively low affinity. Cereals with the highest percentage of lignin in the fiber (> 3%) were also the fiber sources with the lowest apparent digestibility.

Binding of these lectins in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues was demonstrated using either the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) method or the avidin-biotin method. Healthy oral epithelia revealed binding sites for these lectins mostly in the suprabasal keratinocytes with occasional PNA binding also in their basal cells.

Therefore, the ratio of (2-pyr + 4-pyr)/MNA increased with increasing dietary casein and methionine levels. When the limiting amino acids of casein or soy protein isolate were added to a low casein or low soy protein isolate diet, the urinary ratio of (2-pyr + 4-pyr)/MNA also increased.

Our results showed that high PO diets did not promote chemically induced mammary tumorigenesis in female rats when compared to high CO or SBO diets. CO and SBO differ greatly from the palm oils in their contents of tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenes. But further experiments would be required to determine whether the observed differences in tumor incidence and tumor numbers were due to the differences in these minor components or due to the unique triglyceride structure of the palm oils. Analysis of the fatty acid profiles of plasma total lipids of tumor-bearing rats and of the tumor total lipids showed that, with the exception of arachidonic acid, the fatty acid profiles reflect the nature of the dietary fats.

Gottardis","Strategies for breast cancer therapy with antiestrogens","Current clinical research is focused upon the application of adjuvant therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Combination chemotherapy is the most successful adjuvant therapy for premenopausal patients whereas the antiestrogen tamoxifen (1 or 2 yr) is successful in postmenopausal disease. We have developed a unifying strategy for the treatment of breast cancer. The thesis is based upon the application of continuous adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen in a low estrogen environment. Chemotherapy causes a chemical castration in premenopausal patients. In contrast, tamoxifen causes an increase in steroidogenesis. A combination of both approaches will work against each other until ovarian failure occurs. Patients should be checked for castration to provide a new estrogen environment in which tamoxifen, a competitive antagonist of estrogen action, can effectively work. Laboratory evidence using carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumor models demonstrates the efficacy of long-term therapy. Studies with the human breast cell line MCF-7 grown in athymic mice show that tamoxifen is a tumoristatic agent so that once the therapy is stopped, tumors can be regrown by estrogen administration. Patients should receive continuous tamoxifen therapy to prevent the growth-stimulating effects of adrenal steroids, environmental and phyto-estrogens.",NA,"*breast cancer/dt [Drug Therapy] female human *ovariectomy short survey *antiestrogen *corticosteroid *phytoestrogen *tamoxifen","493-498","27","1987",-1

Its survival will probably depend on accelerated captive breeding. At this time, however, reproductive failure and liver disease threaten the future of the captive cheetah population. Histopathological evaluation of more than 100 cheetah livers identified venocclusive disease as the main hepatic lesion responsible for liver disease in this species. Analysis of the commercial feline diet by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed large amounts of two phytoestrogens identified as daidzein and genistein. These compounds were found to be derived from a soybean product that was a component of the cheetah diet, and their concentrations both ranged from 18 to 35 mug/g diet. The adult cheetah consequently consumes ~50 mg/day of these weak estrogens. When extracts of the diet were tested for estrogenicity using a bioassay, a dose-related increase in uterine weight was observed. In 4 cheetahs studied, withdrawal of this feline diet by substitution with a chicken diet resulted in an improvement in conventional liver function tests and a normalization in the appearance of hepatic mitochondria. We conclude that the relatively high concentrations of phytoestrogens from soybean protein present in the commercial diet fed to captive cheetahs in North American zoos may be one of the major factors in the decline of fertility and in the etiology of liver disease in this species. The survival of the captive cheetah population could depend upon a simple change of diet by excluding exogenous estrogen.",NA,"priority journal","225-233","93","1987",-1

Aliquots (0.25 ml) were incubated in 5 ml medium, with the addition of excess trypsin (2 mg/ml) to experimental flasks. Oestrogen was measured by means of a radioreceptor assay (RRA) based on rat or human uterine cytosolic oestradiol receptor. In oestrogen receptor positive (ER +ve) tumour homogenates, TAME decreased while STI increased ethyl acetate extractable oestrogen in these preparations. The addition of trypsin enhanced yields of oestrogen in the TAME, but not in the STI or control (no inhibitor) preparations. None of these treatments affected RRA detectable oestrogen in homogenates of ER -ve tumours. Suspension of ZR-75-1 cells, prepared in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate (KRBG) incubated with trypsin also gave greatly enhanced yields of extractable oestrogen. Fractionation of oestrogens from both tumour homogenates and from the cell line showed coincidence of RRA detectable steroid with oestradiol and oestrone, and, particularly in trypsin flasks, very non-polar components were also found. In the cell-line extracts, HPLC fractionation combined with specific radioimmunoassays confirmed the presence of both oestradiol and oestrone. The major extracted component was oestrone. The data suggest the existence within breast tumour tissue of sequestered pools of steroid requiring proteolytic action for their release. One possibility, consistent with reports in the literature is that the steroids may themselves be directly conjugated to protein. Their presence in ER +ve but not ER -ve tumours strongly suggests some relationship to the development of hormone-sensitive disease.

The single polypeptide chain of PA contains 240-amino acid residues and has a calculated M(r) of 26,496. An N-linked carbohydrate side chain is predicted as asparagine-45, and O-linked carbohydrate side chains are possibly attached to serine-69, threonine-70, and serine-71. The primary structure of PA shows a high degree of sequence homology with other serine proteases of the kallikrein family. The active site residues of histidine, aspartic acid, and serine comprising the charge-relay system of typical serine proteases were found in similar positions in PA (histidine-41, aspartic acid-96, and serine-192). At pH 7.8, PA hydrolyzed insulin A and B chains, recombinant interleukin 2, and - to a lesser extent - gelatin, myoglobin, ovalbumin, and fibrinogen. The cleavage sites of these proteins by PA were chemically analyzed as the alpha-carboxyl side of some hydrophobic residues, tyrosine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine, and of basic residues histidine, lysine, and arginine. The chymotrypsin-like activity of PA exhibited with the chromogenic substrate N-succinyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-proyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitroanilide yielded a specific activity of 9.21 muM per min per mg of PA and K(m) and k(cat) values of 15.3 mM and 0.075 s-1, respectively.

In addition, the mean excretion of the isoflavonic phytoestrogen equol tended to be lower. Because nonhuman primates appear to be remarkably resistant to the carcinogenic effect of estrogens, we investigated the possible occurrence of lignans and phytoestrogen in the urine of chimpanzees on their regular diet. Five major diphenols were isolated and identified by capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry by comparison with synthesized authentic reference compounds. Three of these compounds, the phytoestrogen equol and its precursor daidzein, the lignan enterolactone, were according to preliminary assays excreted in very large amounts. In addition, the lignan enterodiol and the diadzein metabolite O-desmethylangolensin were identified. It is concluded that the chimpanzee excretes both isoflavonic phytoestrogens and lignans in urine, apparently in high concentrations. It is suggested that these compounds may play a role in the maintenance of the resistance against carcinogenic effects of estrogens, which nonhuman primates possess, because both equol and enterolactone have been shown to have antiestrogenic properties in animals.

P-vesicles incubated in 136 mM Na+ containing 0.9 muM I- with 125I- for 2 min accumulated I- so that the I- concentration in the vesicles became about 2 muM. Addition of 5-20 muM stable I- to the incubation mixture at 2 min incubation resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in previously loaded 125I- in the vesicles. In other words, a dose-dependent increase in efflux of preloaded 125I- was observed. While the efflux occurred, Na+-dependent I- influx into P-vesicles was preserved. When 2 mM ClO4-, a specific inhibitor of Na+-dependent I- influx, was added together with 10 muM I-, the external I- failed to diminish preloaded 125I- in P-vesicles.

Soy based formulas have been used to treat infants with allergy or food intolerance. However, it is unclear whether they can help prevent allergy and food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance.Objectives: To determine the effect of feeding adapted soy formula compared to human milk, cow's milk formula or a hydrolysed protein formula on preventing allergy or food intolerance in infants without clinical evidence of allergy or food intolerance.Search methods: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. Updated searches were performed of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 - March 2006), EMBASE (1980 - March 2006), CINAHL (1982 - March 2006) and previous reviews including cross references.Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that compare the use of an adapted soy formula to human milk, an adapted cow's milk or a hydrolysed protein formula for feeding infants without clinical allergy or food intolerance in the first six months of life. Only trials with > 80% follow up of participants and reported in group of assignment were eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Eligibility of studies for inclusion, methodological quality and data extraction were assessed independently by each review author. Primary outcomes included clinical allergy, specific allergies and food intolerance. Where no heterogeneity of treatment effect was found, the fixed effect model was used for meta-analysis. Where significant or apparent heterogeneity was found, results were reported using the random effects model and potential causes of the heterogeneity were sought.Main results: Three eligible studies enrolling high risk infants with a history of allergy in a first degree relative were included. No eligible study enrolled infants fed human milk. No study examined the effect of early, short term soy formula feeding. All compared prolonged soy formula to cow's milk formula feeding. One study was of adequate methodology and without unbalanced allergy preventing co-interventions in treatment groups. One study with unclear allocation concealment and 19.5% losses reported a significant reduction in infant allergy, asthma and allergic rhinitis. However, no other study reported any significant benefits from the use of a soy formula. Meta-analysis found no significant difference in childhood allergy incidence (2 studies; typical RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37, 1.44). No significant difference was reported in one study in infant asthma (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86, 1.40), infant eczema (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.95, 1.52), childhood eczema prevalence (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.73, 1.68), infant rhinitis (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76, 1.16) or childhood rhinitis prevalence (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73, 2.00). Meta-analysis found no significant difference in childhood asthma incidence (3 studies, 728 infants; typical RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.26, 1.92), childhood eczema incidence (2 studies, 283 infants; typical RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.90, 2.75) or childhood rhinitis incidence (2 studies, 283 infants; typical RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.06, 8.00).

No study compared soy formula to hydrolysed protein formula.Authors' conclusions: Feeding with a soy formula cannot be recommended for prevention of allergy or food intolerance in infants at high risk of allergy or food intolerance.

This study evaluated the acceptability and effectiveness of a soy beverage containing phytoestrogens as a treatment for hot flashes in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in postmenopausal women with moderate hot flashes who were previously treated for early-stage breast cancer. Women were stratified for tamoxifen use and randomized to a soy beverage (n = 59) containing 90 mg of isoflavones or to a placebo rice beverage (n = 64). Women recorded the number and severity of hot flashes daily with a daily menopause diary for 4 weeks at baseline and for 12 weeks while consuming 500 mL of a soy or placebo beverage. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the soy and placebo groups in the number of hot flashes or hot flash scores. However, presumably because of a strong placebo effect, both groups had significant reductions in hot flashes. Mild gastrointestinal side effects were experienced by both groups but occurred with greater frequency and severity with soy. The mean serum genistein concentration at 6 weeks was significantly higher in women who consumed soy (0.61 +/- 0.43 micromol/L) compared with placebo (0.43 +/- 0.37 micromol/L) (P =.02). Overall acceptability and compliance were high and similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: The soy beverage did not alleviate hot flashes in women with breast cancer any more than did a placebo.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the potential health effects of isoflavone consumption on normal breast tissue; isoflavone concentrations, metabolites, and biodistribution were investigated and compared with 17beta-estradiol exposure. DESIGN: In this dietary intervention study, healthy women were randomly allocated to a soy milk (n = 11; 16.98-mg genistein and 5.40-mg daidzein aglycone equivalents per dose), soy supplement (n = 10; 5.27-mg genistein and 17.56-mg daidzein aglycone equivalents per dose), or control (n = 10) group. After a run-in period > or = 4 d, 3 doses of soy milk or soy supplements were taken daily for 5 d before an esthetic breast reduction. Blood and breast biopsies were collected during surgery and analyzed with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: After soy administration, genistein and total daidzein concentrations, which were expressed as aglycone equivalents, ranged from 135.1 to 2831 nmol/L and 105.1 to 1397 nmol/L, respectively, in hydrolyzed serum and from 92.33 to 493.8 pmol/g and 22.15 to 770.8 pmol/g, respectively, in hydrolyzed breast tissue. The major metabolites identified in nonhydrolyzed samples were genistein-7-O-glucuronide and daidzein-7-O-glucuronide, with an overall glucuronidation of 98%. Total isoflavones showed a breast adipose/glandular tissue distribution of 40:60, and their mean (+/-SEM) derived 17beta-estradiol equivalents toward estrogen receptor beta were 21 +/- 4-fold and 40 +/- 10-fold higher than the 17beta-estradiol concentrations in adipose (0.283 +/- 0.089 pmol/g, P < 0.001) and glandular (0.246 +/- 0.091 pmol/g, P = 0.001) fractions, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the breast-milk intake of 9-10-mo-old infants given either a ready-to-use complementary food (RUCF) paste or a standard corn-soy blend (UNIMIX) porridge in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. DESIGN: Infants were randomly assigned at 6 mo of age to receive either RUCF (n = 700) or UNIMIX (n = 700) for 6 mo. Breast-milk intake was measured at 9-10 mo in a subsample of 58 infants (29 from each group). Mothers received a dose of ?30 g deuterium oxide. Predose and postdose saliva samples were collected from both mothers and infants over 2 wk. Breast-milk intake (g/d) was measured from saliva samples by using infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: Mean (±SD) breast-milk intake was not significantly (P = 0.69) different between the 2 groups: RUCF (705 ± 236 g/d) and UNIMIX (678 ± 285 g/d).

Three groups of 48 infants were randomly constituted. Infants in groups 1 and 2 consumed at least twice a day gruel made either from the instant flour or from the food supplement. Infants from the control group received complementary foods prepared in the usual way. Each infant was surveyed during a whole day in order to measure feeding frequencies and characteristics as well as amounts of the different types of complementary foods consumed. Foods consumed by infants in the two experimental groups differed considerably in energy, micronutrient density and in consistency from the home-made complementary foods. Due to the incorporation of amylases, gruels made from the food supplement had a higher energy density, a more appropriate consistency and resulted in higher intakes per meal than gruels made from instant flour. In comparison with home-made complementary foods, both experimental products resulted in significantly higher energy and nutrient intakes.

Research indicates, however, that soy protein and phytate in soy products inhibit the absorption of divalent cations. METHODS: Our study was primarily designed to determine the effect of consuming two to three servings per day of soy foods, providing ?19?g protein and ?36?mg isoflavones, on iron and zinc status in premenopausal women during a 10-weeks period. As secondary outcomes, we also tested the effect of soy foods on biochemical markers of bone and thyroid hormones. Nonsmoking women (18-28 years) without chronic disease, anemia, pregnancy, or irregular menstrual cycles were randomly assigned to either the soy food (SF, n=31) or animal food (AF, n=32) group. Blood and urine samples and 3-day dietary records were collected at baseline and postintervention. RESULTS: At baseline, iron and zinc status, bone markers, and thyroid hormones were not different between groups. After intervention, no significant changes were observed in hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, serum iron, ferritin, or transferrin receptor (TFR) concentrations.

The effect of feeding different infant formulas on the incidence of atopic disease and food allergy was assessed in a prospective randomized double-blind study of high-risk infants with a family history of atopy. METHODS: 216 high-risk infants whose mothers had elected not to breast-feed were randomized to receive exclusively a partial whey hydrolysate formula or a conventional cow's milk formula or a soy formula until 6 months of age. Seventy-two high risk infants breast-fed for > or = 4 months were also studied. RESULTS: Follow-up until 5 years of age showed a significant lowering in the cumulative incidence of atopic disease in the breast-fed (odds ratio 0.422 [0.200-0.891]) and the whey hydrolysate (odds ratio 0.322 [0.159-0.653) groups, compared with the conventional cow's milk group. Soy formula was not effective (odds ratio 0.759 [0.384-1.501]). The occurrence of both eczema and asthma was lowest in the breast-fed and whey hydrolysate groups and was comparable in the cow's milk and soy groups. Similar significant differences were noted in the 18-60 month period prevalence of eczema and asthma. Eczema was less severe in the whey hydrolysate group compared with the other groups. Double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges showed a lower prevalence of food allergy in the whey hydrolysate group compared with the other formula groups.

Long-term pharmacological therapy is unacceptable to most women, and is not warranted for moderate symptoms. Nutritional therapies are popular, but lack a clear evidence base. Anecdotal evidence suggests beneficial effects of soy isoflavones because of their influence on endogenous oestrogen and actions on specific tissues. The effect of isolated soya protein (ISP) containing 68 mg/d (aglycone equivalents) soy isoflavones (IF) on premenstrual symptom severity was studied in a seven-menstrual cycle, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover intervention study in twenty-three women with prospectively confirmed PMS aged 18-35 years and BMI 19-30 kg/m(2). ISP containing IF or milk protein placebo was consumed for two complete menstrual cycles. ISP containing IF (genistein, daidzein, equol) were measured in 24 h urine samples. After two cycles of ISP containing IF intervention, total symptoms (F(2,36) 8.20, P=0.000) and physical symptoms (F(2,36) 8.18, P=0.000) were significantly reduced compared with baseline after both active and placebo treatments, although differences between active and placebo treatment were non-significant.

Because symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea are not part of the infant colic syndrome, infants with these gastrointestinal symptoms were excluded from the study. Dietary changes were accomplished by either feeding the infants a hydrolyzed casein formula or by requiring mothers to eliminate milk from their diets.

Catch-up growth is, therefore, necessary and this depends very much on the type of food, in terms of nutrient density, protein quality and digestibility, given to the child. Fermented (F) and non-fermented (NF) maize-soybean porridges of increased nutrient density were formulated and compared with traditionally fermented maize-only porridge (P) for acceptability using mothers in peri-urban Ghana as well as urban Nigeria as subjects. Subsequently, infants hospitalised in paediatric wards for acute diarrhoea, from the same communities in both countries, were assigned randomly to one or other of the three porridges. Infant subjects in all cases fell within the ages of 6-15 months. Complementary to regular breast-feeding, infants could consume as much porridge as they wanted and their total daily consumption was interpreted as an indication of acceptance. Although mothers in both the environments of Ghana and Nigeria rated P as more acceptable than F and NF, no significant difference was recorded in the quantitative intake by infants of the three formula groups. By adding enzyme-rich cereal malt flour (at the 1-5% level by weight) as a viscosity-thinning agent to F and NF porridges, it was possible to feed these porridges to infants at total solids concentration levels of 20-25% (wet basis) which is approximately double the solid matter content of the P porridge. Consequently, the daily nutrient intake by infants consuming F and NF porridges was considerably higher compared to the P porridge group. It is concluded that the concept of high nutrient density weaning foods is a feasible vehicle for an improvement of nutrient supply to infants.",NA,"Acute Disease Biological Availability Breast Feeding Cohort Studies Colony Count, Microbial Diarrhea, Infantile [diet therapy] Fermentation Food Handling Food, Fortified Ghana Infant Food [standards] Infant, Newborn Lactates [administration & dosage] [therapeutic use] Lactic Acid Nigeria Nutritional Status Nutritive Value Soybeans Zea mays Adult[checkword] Female[checkword] Humans[checkword] Male[checkword] Sr-compmed","353-62",NA,"1995",-1

OBJECTIVE: To assess the biological activity of isoflavone phytoestrogens, we analyzed the effect of dietary soy isoflavone supplementation on in vivo bioassays of estrogenicity. DESIGN: Fifty healthy postmenopausal women aged 50-75 y participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which they received either soy protein isolate (40 g soy protein, 118 mg isoflavones) or casein placebo. Measurements were made at baseline and at 3 mo. Urinary isoflavone excretion was measured to reflect compliance. The bioassays of estrogenicity included measurement of hepatic proteins and gonadotropin concentrations. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were not significantly different between the soy and placebo groups. Urinary isoflavone excretion increased in the soy group and at the end of 3 mo was higher in the soy group than in the placebo group. In plasma samples from both groups, C-reactive protein increased significantly over the 3-mo treatment period, whereas sex hormone-binding globulin and thyroid-binding globulin decreased significantly. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in hepatic protein synthesis (change over 3 mo +/- SEM in the soy and placebo groups, respectively): C-reactive protein, 0.42 +/- 0.2 and 0.48 +/- 0.2 U/mL; sex hormone-binding globulin, -6.9 +/- 1.5 and -10.0 +/- 2.1 micro g/mL; thyroid-binding globulin, -16 +/- 8 and -26 +/- 7 nmol/L. Furthermore, gonadotropin and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentrations did not change significantly in either group. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy postmenopausal women, dietary soy isoflavones do not affect in vivo biological indicators of estrogenicity, including hepatic protein synthesis and gonadotropin concentrations.

Early studies of soy flour-based formulas showed decreased immunoglobulin production when soy protein intake was limited. However, there were no significant differences in rotavirus vaccine responses between breast-fed and soy protein isolate-based formula-fed infants. Nucleotides added to milk-based formula benefit infant immune status, but reports of the immunologic effects of adding nucleotides to soy-based formula are not available. This study evaluated immune status and morbidity of infants fed soy protein isolate formulas with and without added nucleotides for 1 year.

A nonrandomized human milk/formula cohort (n = 81) was concurrently enrolled. Recommended immunizations were administered at 2, 4, and 6 months. Immune status was determined from antibody responses to Haemophilus influenzae type b, tetanus, diphtheria, and poliovirus vaccines at 6, 7, and 12 months. Parents and physicians reported morbidity data. RESULTS: All vaccine responses were within normal ranges. No response differences were observed between infants fed soy formula and those fed nucleotide-supplemented soy.

Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) decreased by 7.8% in the genistein arm and increased by 4.4% in the placebo arm (P = 0.051). The PSA level was reduced in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue in the placebo arm. In the genistein arm, the PSA level in tumor and normal tissue was comparable. Total cholesterol was significantly lower in the genistein arm (P = 0.013). There were no significant effects on thyroid or sex hormones. Plasma concentrations of total genistein were on average 100-fold higher in the genistein arm after treatment (P < 0.001). Genistein at a dose that can be easily obtained from a diet rich in soy reduced the level of serum PSA in patients with localized CaP, without any effects on hormones.

In order to assess the efficacy of this, a therapeutic trial was undertaken in which hospitalized gastroenteritis patients previously on milk-formula feeds were randomly fed, from the time of admission, either their original feed or a lactose-free soya preparation; patients previously on human milk with or without a supplement continued to receive this during their diarrheal illness. The results show that in nonrotaviral gastroenteritis, there is no difference in the duration of the illness irrespective of the type of feed given. In rotaviral gastroenteritis, continued breast-feeding significantly reduces the duration of acute diarrhea, while lactose-free soya feeds do not lead to a significant reduction in the duration of the illness when compared to cow's milk-formula feeds. Hence, it is concluded that (a) breast-feeding should be continued during an episode of infantile diarrhea, and that (b) empirical use of soya preparations from the time of hospital admission is not justified; however, the latter should be considered in infants whose purging rate goes up or diarrheal disease severity worsens 3 to 4 days after the onset of diarrhea or hospital stay and who are passing significant amounts of reducing sugars in their stool.",NA,"Acute Disease Clinical Trials as Topic Diarrhea, Infantile [diet therapy] [etiology] Gastroenteritis [complications] [diet therapy] Infant Food Infant, Newborn Milk Milk, Human Rotavirus Infections [complications] [diet therapy] Soybeans Animals[checkword] Child, Preschool[checkword] Humans[checkword] Infant[checkword] Sr-child: sr-compmed","193-8",NA,"1990",-1

This may be due to differences in isoflavone metabolism. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether soy isoflavone phase II metabolism differs between humans and rodents. DESIGN: Circulating total and unconjugated isoflavone concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry in plasma samples from 7 separate studies: 1) in Sprague-Dawley rats and in 3 strains of mice fed commercial soy-containing diets; 2) in Sprague-Dawley rats gavaged with genistein; 3) in healthy adults who consumed single servings of soy nuts, soy milk, and tempeh; 4) in healthy adults subchronically given soy milk; 5) in healthy women orally administered 50 mg genistein; 6) in healthy women orally administered 20 mg pure S-(-)equol; and 7) in 6-mo-old infants fed soy infant formula and later, at age 3 y, a soy germ isoflavone supplement. RESULTS: The proportion of unconjugated genistein in plasma from adults and infants who consumed different soy foods, pure genistein, or an isoflavone supplement was <1% in steady state and <2% at peak concentrations. By contrast, rodents fed soy-containing diets conjugate isoflavones less efficiently. The plasma percentages of unconjugated genistein concentrations in Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6, nude, and transgenic AngptL4B6 mice were 4.0 ± 0.6%, 4.6 ± 0.6%, 11.6 ± 0%, and 30.1 ± 4.3%, respectively, which represent 20, 23, 58, and 150 times that in humans.

We tested the effect of a soymilk supplement rich in isoflavones on a measure of cellular lipid peroxidation in a controlled feeding study. Eight premenopausal women consumed a constant diet that included soymilk containing 113-207 mg/day total isoflavones and 4 mo later a constant soy diet low (<5 mg/day) in isoflavones, both for a complete menstrual cycle. The average daily urinary excretions of daidzein and genistein were 24.6 +/- 10.1 and 9.2 +/- 6.1 mg/day, respectively, during the high-isoflavone soy diet and were below the detection limit during the low-isoflavone diet. F2 isoprostane 8-iso-PGF-2alpha excretion varied widely within and between subjects, and the group mean was not significantly different during the high- and low-isoflavone soy diet (7.67 +/- 1.13 and 8.65 +/- 1.18 nmol/12 h, mean +/- SD, respectively). However, individual changes in 8-iso-PGF-2alpha between the two soymilk drinks were significantly associated with age (r = -0.87; P = 0.006) and several measures of isoflavone exposure, namely, daidzein dose (r = 0.81; P = 0.015), combined daidzein and genistein dose (r = 0.77; P = 0.03), and total urinary excretion of isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and equol) (r = 0.71; P = 0.05).

Previous research has pointed to important genetic influences as well as dietary effects through marked calorie or protein restriction. We conducted a randomized trial to determine the effects of 2 dietary patterns on serum IGF-1, IGFBP1 and IGFBP3 in free-living premenopausal women: phase 1, an isocaloric low-fat, high-fiber (LFHF) vs. usual diet, and phase 2, a soy supplement either with or without isoflavones (soy+IF vs. soy-IF). Participants completed 12 menstrual cycles on phase 1 and then were randomly assigned to a soy supplement for 3 cycles while maintaining the phase 1 diet. Before and after each phase, 154 women provided serum. We found no difference in the change in IGF-I, BP1 or BP3 in the LFHF group compared to the usual diet group. In phase 2, there were no differences in any IGF protein between the soy+IF and the soy-IF groups or any evidence of interaction between isoflavone exposure and the background diet. However, there was a small but statistically significant decrease (2.3%) in BP3 and an increase in the IGF-I:BP3 molar ratio among all 153 subjects following either soy supplement.

Although plasma and urine levels of these compounds after ingestion have been thoroughly investigated, little is known about their tissue distribution, which is particularly important for tissues with high endogenous estrogen and estrogen receptor concentrations. We aimed to investigate the concentrations of genistein, daidzein, and equol in human breast tissue homogenate and to compare these with the corresponding values in serum and urine. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the concentrations of soy-derived phytoestrogens achieved in breast tissue homogenate, serum, and urine after ingestion of either a soy-based food supplement (n = 9) or a placebo tablet (n = 19) for 5 consecutive evenings before aesthetic breast surgery. To account for the heterogeneity of the breast tissue samples, markers for cellularity, epithelial content, blood vessel content, and total fat were determined. RESULTS: Urine concentrations of genistein, daidzein, and equol were significantly higher in the soy-supplemented subjects than in the subjects ingesting the placebo (P <.05). Only genistein was found to be significantly higher in serum of the soy group than in the placebo group, and no significant differences were found in breast tissue homogenate concentrations of all analytes between the 2 groups.

We studied the effects of daily use of isoflavonoids on climacteric symptoms and quality of life in patients with a history of breast cancer. METHODS: Sixty-two postmenopausal symptomatic women were randomized to use either phytoestrogen (tablets containing 114 mg of isoflavonoids) or a placebo for 3 months; the treatment regimens were reversed after a 2-month washout period. Fifty-six women completed the study. Menopausal symptoms were recorded on the Kupperman index and the visual analogue scale, and working capacity and mood changes were assessed via validated questionnaires. In addition, we followed the levels of phytoestrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin.

However, questions about the long-term safety of genistein on breast as well as its continued efficacy still remain. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the continued safety profile of genistein aglycone on breast and endometrium and its effects on bone after 3 yr of therapy. DESIGN: The parent study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 389 osteopenic, postmenopausal women for 24-months. Subsequently, a subcohort (138 patients) continued therapy for an additional year. Patients and Interventions: Participants received 54 mg of genistein aglycone daily (n = 71) or placebo (n = 67). Both treatment arms received calcium and vitamin D(3) in therapeutic doses. MAIN OUTCOMES: Mammographic density was assessed at baseline, 24 and 36 months by visual classification scale and digitized quantification. BRCA1 and BRCA2, sister chromatid exchange, and endometrial thickness were also evaluated. Lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density were also assessed. Secondary outcomes were biochemical levels of bone markers. RESULTS: After 36 months, genistein did not significantly change mammographic breast density or endometrial thickness, BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression was preserved, whereas sister chromatid exchange was reduced compared with placebo. Bone mineral density increases were greater with genistein for both femoral neck and lumbar spine compared to placebo. Genistein also significantly reduced pyridinoline, as well as serum carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide and soluble receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand while increasing bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, IGF-I, and osteoprotegerin levels.

Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI. Isoflavone concentrations were inversely associated with risk of fibroadenomas. Adjusted OR (95% CI) for the highest versus the lowest quartile of plasma concentration were 0.36 (0.16-0.79; P-trend < 0.001) for daidzein and 0.39 (0.19-0.84; P-trend = 0.010) for genistein. We also observed inverse associations between higher percentages of the RBC (n-3) fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ([0.38 (0.19-0.77); P-trend = 0.007] and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) [0.32 (0.15-0.70); P-trend = 0.024], and fibroadenoma risk. Circulating concentrations of carotenoids, vitamin C, retinol, and ferritin were not associated with fibroadenoma risk. The inverse associations between plasma isoflavone concentrations and RBC EPA and DPA and fibroadenoma risk suggest that higher intakes of soy foods and fatty fish may lower the risk of fibroadenomas.",NA,"Biological Markers [blood] Breast Neoplasms [blood] [epidemiology] [ethnology] Case-Control Studies China Diet Fibroadenoma [blood] [epidemiology] [ethnology] Risk Factors Adult[checkword] Female[checkword] Humans[checkword] Middle Aged[checkword]","1302-10",NA,"2010",-1

DESIGN: A randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial. SUBJECTS: In all, 34 of the initially enrolled 37 subjects completed all requirements. INTERVENTION: All subjects were followed for two full menstrual cycles and the first seven days of a third cycle. During menstrual cycle 1, plasma concentrations of estradiol (E(2)), estrone (E(1)), estrone-sulfate (E(1)-S), testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), and sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured on cycle day 2, 3, or 4, and urinary equol measured on day 7 after a 4-day soy challenge. Subjects then received either probiotic capsules (containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum) or placebo capsules through day 7 of menstrual cycle 3, at which time both the plasma hormone concentrations and the post-soy challenge urinary equol measurements were repeated. RESULTS: During menstrual cycle 1, equol excretors and non-excretors were not significantly different with respect to subject characteristics, diet, or hormone concentrations. Significant inverse correlations were found between E(2) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.02), SHBG and BMI (P=0.01), DHEA-S and dietary fiber (P=0.04), and A and protein:carbohydrate ratio (P=0.02). Probiotic consumption failed to significantly alter equol excretor status or hormone concentrations during menstrual cycle 3, although there were trends towards decreased concentrations of T (P=0.14) and SHBG (P=0.10) in the probiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to verify a previously reported finding of premenopausal equol excretors having plasma hormone concentrations different from those of nonexcretors.

Our secondary aim was to determine the socio-economic factors associated with developmental outcomes in the same population. A total of 163 six-month-old rural Malawian children were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial where the control population received daily supplementation with 71 g corn-soy flour [Likuni Phala (LP)] (282 kcal) and individuals in the intervention groups received daily either 50 g of lipid-based nutrient supplement (FS50) (264 kcal) or 25 g of lipid-based nutrient supplement (FS25) (130 kcal). The main outcome measures were Griffiths' developmental scores at 0-2 years. Independent comparison of study groups was carried out using analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics where mean raw scores, quotients, or mental ages were compared. Association of developmental outcome with predictor variables were examined using multiple regression. At 18 months of chronological age, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) mental ages in the LP, FS50, and FS25 groups were 17.9 ± 1.3, 17.9 ± 1.3, and 17.9 ± 1.2 (P > 0.99), respectively.

The association of a lower incidence of postmenopausal symptoms with high intake of soybeans in Asian women suggests that phytoestrogens are an alternative to estrogen therapy. The main effective compounds in soybean are isoflavones, which have a higher binding affinity to estrogen receptor beta than to estrogen receptor alpha. The aim of present study was to evaluate the effects of isoflavone treatment in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: This was a double-blind prospective study. Sixty healthy postmenopausal women were randomly assigned by computer into two groups to receive 60 mg isoflavones or placebo daily for 3 months. Before and after treatment, climacteric symptoms were recorded; serum was collected to measure the levels of lipoprotein lipids, estradiol, and follicle-stimulating hormone; and biopsy specimens from endometrium and breast were analyzed to investigate the expression level of steroid receptors and proliferation. Endometrial thickness was measured by ultrasound. RESULTS: Fifty-one women finished the 12-week study. In women receiving 60 mg isoflavones daily, hot flashes and night sweats were reduced by 57% and 43%, respectively. The treatment did not change the levels of circulating estradiol or follicle-stimulating hormone. Immunohistochemical staining of endometrial and breast biopsy specimens revealed that isoflavones did not affect expression levels of steroid receptors; estrogen receptors alpha, beta, and betacx; progesterone receptors A and B; or the proliferation marker Ki67. No side effects on body weight or lipoprotein lipids were observed.

Our aim was to determine the effects of taking a red clover-derived isoflavone supplement daily for 1 year on mammographic breast density. Effects on oestradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), lymphocyte tyrosine kinase activity and menopausal symptoms were also assessed. METHODS: A total of 205 women (age range 49-65 years) with Wolfe P2 or DY mammographic breast patterns were randomly assigned to receive either a red clover-derived isoflavone tablet (26 mg biochanin A, 16 mg formononetin, 1 mg genistein and 0.5 mg daidzein) or placebo. Change in mammographic breast density, serum oestradiol, FSH, LH, menopausal symptoms and lymphocyte tyrosine kinase activity from baseline to 12 months were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 177 women completed the trial. Mammographic breast density decreased in both groups but the difference between the treatment and placebo was not statistically significant. There was a significant interaction between treatment group and oestrogen receptor (ESR1) PvuII polymorphism for the change in estimated percentage breast density (mean +/- standard deviation): TT isoflavone 1.4 +/- 12.3% and TT placebo -9.6 +/- 14.2%; CT isoflavone -5.2 +/- 12.0% and CT placebo -2.8 +/- 10.3%; and CC isoflavone -3.4 +/- 9.7% and CC placebo -1.1 +/- 9.5%. There were no statistically significant treatment effects on oestradiol, FSH, or LH (assessed only in postmenopausal women), or on lymphocyte tyrosine kinase activity. Baseline levels of menopausal symptoms were low, and there were no statistically significant treatment effects on frequency of hot flushes or other menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSION: In contrast to studies showing that conventional hormone replacement therapies increase mammographic breast density, the isoflavone supplement did not increase mammographic breast density in this population of women.

To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of three soy powders containing different levels of isoflavones in 18 postmenopausal women. Isoflavones were consumed relative to bodyweight [control: 0.11 +/- 0.01; low isoflavone (low-iso): 1.00 +/- 0.01; high isoflavone (high-iso): 2.00 +/- 0.02 mg/kg/day] for 93 days each in a randomized crossover design. Blood was collected on day 1 of the study (baseline) and days 36-38, 64-66, and 92-94 of each diet period, for analysis of estrogens, androgens, gonadotropins, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), prolactin, insulin, cortisol, and thyroid hormones. Vaginal cytology specimens were obtained at baseline and at the end of each diet period, and endometrial biopsies were performed at baseline and at the end of the high-iso diet period, to provide additional measures of estrogen action. Overall, compared with the control diet, the effects of the low-iso and high-iso diets were modest in degree. The high-iso diet resulted in a small but significant decrease in estrone-sulfate (E1-S), a trend toward lower estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), and a small but significant increase in SHBG. For the other hormones, the few significant changes noted were also small and probably not of physiological importance. There were no significant effects of the low-iso or high-iso diets on vaginal cytology or endometrial biopsy results. These data suggest that effects of isoflavones on plasma hormones per se are not significant mechanisms by which soy consumption may exert estrogen-like effects in postmenopausal women.

Isoflavones may, because of their ability to act as selective estrogen receptor modulators, alter insulin-like growth factor (IGF) status. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 1-month isoflavone supplementation (86 mg/day red clover-derived isoflavones) on IGF status. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Healthy pre- (n=16) and postmenopausal (n=7) women were invited to take part in a randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study with a minimum 2-month washout period. RESULTS: : For premenopausal subjects, the change in IGF-1, IGF-BP1 and IGF-BP3 assessed at different points of the menstrual cycle did not differ between isoflavone and placebo phase. However, the change in IGF-1, when examined pre- and post-supplementation, was nonsignificantly reduced (P=0.06) on the isoflavone supplement compared to placebo. For postmenopausal subjects, the change in IGF-1, IGF-BP1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations over the supplementation period did not differ between isoflavone or placebo phase. Isoflavones increased HDL in postmenopausal women compared to placebo (P=0.02) but did not alter either cholesterol or triacylglycerol concentrations, and had no effect on antioxidant status. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 1-month supplementation with red clover isoflavones has a positive effect on HDL cholesterol, but at most a small effect on IGF status in premenopausal and no effect in postmenopausal subjects.

Barnes","Effect of soy protein on endogenous hormones in postmenopausal women Am J Clin Nutr 2002 Sep;76(3):695","BACKGROUND: The long-term clinical effects of soy protein containing various concentrations of isoflavones on endogenous hormones are unknown. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of ingestion of soy protein containing various concentrations of isoflavones on hormone values in postmenopausal women. DESIGN: Seventy-three hypercholesterolemic, free-living, postmenopausal women participated in a 6-mo double-blind trial in which 40 g protein as part of a National Cholesterol Education Program Step I diet was provided as casein from nonfat dry milk (control), isolated soy protein (ISP) containing 56 mg isoflavones (ISP56), or ISP containing 90 mg isoflavones (ISP90). Endogenous hormone concentrations were measured at baseline and at 3 and 6 mo. RESULTS: The concentration of thyroxine and the free thyroxine index were higher in the ISP56 group, and the concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone was higher in the ISP90 group than in the control group at 3 and 6 mo (P < 0.05). Triiodothyronine was significantly higher in the ISP90 group only at 6 mo. Thyroxine, free thyroxine index, and thyroid-stimulating hormone at 6 mo were inversely associated with measures of baseline estrogenicity. No significant differences were found for endogenous estrogens, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, insulin, glucagon, or follicle-stimulating hormone after baseline hormone values were controlled for. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not provide evidence that long-term ingestion of soy protein alters steroid hormone values, but it suggests that soy protein may have small effects on thyroid hormone values that are unlikely to be clinically important. The thyroid effects are, however, consistent with previous findings in animals and highlight the need for future research investigating possible mechanisms of action.",NA,"Sr-compmed","145-53",NA,"2002",1

DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of menopausal women, aged 38 to 60 years, who experienced 4 to 14 hot flashes per day. After a 1-week run-in period, a total of 190 menopausal women were randomized to receive a placebo or 40 or 60 mg/day of a DRI for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean changes from baseline to week 12 in the frequency of hot flashes recorded in the participant diary. The secondary outcomes included changes in quality of life and hormonal profiles. RESULTS: A total of 147 women (77%) completed the study. It was found that 40 and 60 mg of DRI improved hot flash frequency and severity equally. At 8 weeks hot flash frequency was reduced by 43% in the 40-mg DRI group and by 41% in the 60-mg DRI group, compared with 32% in the placebo group (P = not significant vs placebo). The corresponding numbers for 12 weeks were 52%, 51%, and 39%, respectively (P = 0.07 and 0.09 vs placebo). When comparing the two treatment groups with the placebo group, there were significant reductions in mean daily hot flash frequency. The supplement (either 40 or 60 mg) reduced hot flash frequency by 43% at 8 weeks (P = 0.1) and 52% at 12 weeks (P = 0.048) but did not cause any significant changes in endogenous sex hormones or thyroid hormones.

DESIGN--Mothers who planned to breast feed exclusively were randomly allocated to either a restricted diet (avoiding milk and other dairy products, eggs, fish, peanuts, and soybeans) or a diet without restrictions. Mothers who did not plan to breast feed were randomly allocated to using one of three formula feeds. SETTING--Child health centre in Canada. SUBJECTS--97 Mothers who chose to breast feed and 124 mothers who did not. INTERVENTIONS--Restricted diet for 49 mothers who breast fed.

A saturated fat formula with coconut oil/soybean oil (COCO/SOY) had a fatty acid content and polyunsaturated/saturated ratio (P/S, 0.55) comparable with that of human milk fat (P/S, 0.39) and had the same fat energy content (50% kcal). The second formula, with corn oil/soybean oil (CORN/SOY), was highly unsaturated (P/S, 4.6), with only 35% kcal from fat. Energy intake and body weight gain were similar for all groups. Plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels were significantly lower (greater than 20% on average) in infants fed the CORN/SOY formula than in infants fed either the COCO/SOY formula or human milk. Infants fed the CORN/SOY formula also had lower (25% to 35%) plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels and low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratios.

This pilot study examined whether symptom reduction was greater with more frequent administration and with higher daily doses. In addition, we explored possible effect modification by equol producer status. METHODS: We randomized 130 perimenopausal (no menses in the past 3 mo) and postmenopausal (>12 mo of amenorrhea) women with a mean of five or more moderate/severe hot flashes per day to treatment arms with varying total daily isoflavone doses and dosing frequency, separately for equol producers and nonproducers. Participants recorded the daily frequency and severity of hot flashes. Analyses compared mean daily hot flash intensity scores (sum of hot flashes weighted by severity) by total daily dose and by dosing frequency. Dose-and frequency-related differences were also compared for equol producers and nonproducers. RESULTS: Hot flash intensity scores were lowest in women randomized to the highest total daily dose (100-200 mg) and in women randomized to the highest dosing frequency (twice daily to thrice daily), with greater benefits on nighttime scores than on daytime scores. Dose-and frequency-related differences were somewhat larger in equol producers than in nonproducers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a twice-daily to thrice-daily dosing frequency may improve the benefit of isoflavones for vasomotor symptom relief, particularly in equol producers and for nighttime symptoms.

The objectives were to determine if a diet enriched in alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3) or linoleic acid (omega-6) would influence milk production and composition, metabolic status, and reproductive performance in lactating dairy cows. High-yielding multiparous Holstein dairy cows (n = 120) with no overt clinical illnesses were blocked according to calving date and parity. Cows were assigned randomly to be fed 1) soybean whole roast (Soy, omega-6, n = 40) or 2) linseed (Lin, omega-3, n = 40) or 3) palm oil as a source of SFA (PO, n = 40) from calving until first heat after 40 d postpartum (dpp), and then half of the cows in each treatment group were switched to receive either Lin or SFA (PO) from first heat after d 40 to 120 dpp. Blood was collected from a subsample of cows. Blood was collected at 14 d intervals for 12 wk, starting on the day of calving. Results showed milk yield and DMI were not affected. Milk compositions were similar (P > 0.08) among diets, except concentration and yield of milk fat percentage, which was less in cows fed Lin (P < 0.05). Uterine involution in cows fed Soy occurred earlier (P < 0.05). Diets affected day to first estrus and day to first insemination in cows (P < 0.05). There were no differences among treatments for percent heat detection, percent pregnancy per first insemination, and percent conception per AI at estrus. Also, there is a trend of pregnancy by 120 d, which is 66.7% for the Lin group vs. 50.91% for the PO group (P < 0.08). Of the 4 pregnancy losses, 2 occurred in PO-PO group and 2 occurred in Soy-PO group, and none occurred in the other 4 treatments. In conclusion, our study showed feeding omega-6 fatty acids during 40 dpp could be a good treatment for early postpartum periods, and a shift to omega-3 fatty acids until 40 d after AI can be considered as a strategy for improving fertility in lactating dairy cows 2013 American Society of Animal Science.",NA,"animal // animal disease // animal food/an [Drug Analysis] // article // artificial insemination // body composition // cattle // chemistry // controlled clinical trial // controlled study // crossover procedure // diet // diet supplementation // drug e","713-21",NA,"2013",-1

In total, 480 broilers were randomly assigned to 6 treatments and 4 replications. Broilers were raised with a corn-soybean meal diet including either crude soybean oil or acidulated soybean oil soapstock, each supplemented with vitamin E at 10 or 100 mg or oregano essential oil at 100 mg/kg of feed. At 42 d, broilers were slaughtered and their breast meat was prepared into strips (1.5 x 10 cm) or patties (150 g). Fatty acid composition of the muscle was determined. For lipid oxidation stability, both meat strips and patties were cooked to an internal temperature of 74degreeC and malonaldehyde contents were assessed during 0, 3, 6, and 9 d of storage at 4degreeC. Each storage day had 4 replications per treatment. The meat lipid oxidative stability was estimated by content of malonaldehyde values. Results showed that feed consumption, weight gain, and feed conversion were not affected by the dietary oils or antioxidants, except for the mortality in acidulated soybean oil soapstock with the 10-mg vitamin E treatment. The fatty acid composition of the meat was similar between the 2 diets given the same antioxidant supplement. The oxidation stability of meat lipids in both types of meats showed a significant (P < 0.05) interaction between oils, antioxidants, and storage time. In the crude soybean oil oil diet, the malonaldehyde value in the 10-mg vitamin E treatment was the highest, followed by oregano essential oil, and then the 100-mg vitamin E treatment at 9 d of storage, whereas the value of oregano essential oil in the acidulated soy-bean oil soapstock diet was the highest, followed by the 10-mg vitamin E, and then the 100-mg vitamin E treatment during the 9 d of storage. In conclusion, the dietary oils and antioxidants used can be included in broiler diets without negative effects on their productivity. The antioxidant effect of vitamin E was higher with a higher supplementation level, regardless of the oil treatment, whereas the antioxidant effect of oregano essential oil was better in crude soybean oil than in the acidulated soybean oil soapstock diet. 2012 Poultry Science Association Inc.",NA,"animal // animal disease // animal food/an [Drug Analysis] // article // chemistry // chicken // clinical trial // controlled clinical trial // controlled study // cooking // diet // diet supplementation // lipid peroxidation // meat // Origanum // rand","505-11",NA,"2012",-1

These recommendations were made in the absence of data on functional or clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We compared the fatty acid status, visual evoked potential (VEP) acuity, and growth of term infants fed formula containing an LA:ALA of 10:1 or 5:1 with those of a breast-fed reference cohort. DESIGN: Formula-fed infants were allocated randomly in a double-blind fashion to receive formula with an LA:ALA of either 10:1 (16.9:1.7; n = 36) or 5:1 (16.3:3.3; n = 37) from near birth to 34 wk of age. Increased ALA was attained by replacing soy oil with low-erucic acid cannola oil. A parallel group of breast-fed infants was also recruited. Infant growth and fatty acid status were assessed at 6, 16, and 34 wk of age. VEP acuity was assessed at 16 and 34 wk. RESULTS: Infants fed the 5:1 formula had greater docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids than did infants fed the 10:1 formula, but DHA concentrations of infants fed the 5:1 formula remained less than those in breast-fed infants. The VEP acuity of all formula-fed and breast-fed infants was not significantly different at 16 and 34 wk of age. At birth, infants fed the 5:1 formula were heavier, were longer, and had a greater head circumference than infants assigned to the 10:1 formula group; this differential was maintained throughout the trial. The rate of gain in weight, length, and head circumference was not significantly different between the 2 formula-fed groups, although breast-fed infants had lower weight and length gains than did formula-fed infants between 16 and 34 wk of age. CONCLUSION: Lowering the LA:ALA in formula from 10:1 to 5:1 by using low-erucic acid canola oil resulted in a modest increase in plasma DHA but had no effect on VEP acuity or growth rate.",NA,"Dietary Fats [administration & dosage] [pharmacology] Double-Blind Method Evoked Potentials, Visual [drug effects] Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [blood] Growth [drug effects] Infant Food Infant, Newborn [blood] [growth & development] Linear Models Milk, Human Phospholipids [blood] Smoking Visual Acuity [drug effects] alpha-Linolenic Acid [administration & dosage] [pharmacology] Female[checkword] Humans[checkword] Male[checkword] Sr-child: sr-compmed: sr-neonatal: sr-rehab","120-9",NA,"2000",-1

Preterm infants (30 wk postconception) receiving human milk were compared to infants given one of the following formulae: Formula A was a commercial preterm formula with predominantly 18:2 omega 6 (24.2%) and low (0.5%) 18:3 omega 3; Formula B was based on soy oil and contained similar 18:2 omega 6 levels (20%) and high 18:3 omega 3 (2.7%); Formula C was also a soy oil-based formula (20% 18:2, 1.4% 18:3) but was supplemented with marine oil to provide omega 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) at a level (docosahexaenoic acid, DHA, 0.35%) equivalent to human milk. At entry (10 days of age), the fatty acid composition of plasma and red blood cell (RBC) membrane lipids of the formula groups were identical. By 36 wk postconception, the DHA content in lipids of group A was significantly reduced compared to that in the human milk and marine oil formula groups. Omega-3 LCP results were further amplified by 57 wk with compensatory increases in 22:5 omega 6 in both plasma and RBC lipids. Provision of 2.7% alpha-linolenic acid in formula group B was sufficient to maintain 22:6 omega 3 levels equivalent to those in human milk-fed infants at 36 wk but not at 57 wk. Effects on the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and fragility of RBC attributable to the marine oil supplementation were negligible. The results support the essentiality of omega 3 fatty acids for preterm infants to obtain fatty acid profiles comparable to infants receiving human milk.

Preterm infants fed donor milk from a Midwestern source receive only 20% of the intrauterine accretion of DHA. We tested the hypothesis that DHA supplementation of donor mothers would provide preterm infants with DHA intake equivalent to fetal accretion. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, human milk donors to the Mother's Milk Bank of Ohio were randomized to receive 1 g of DHA (Martek(®) [now DSM Nutritional Lipids, Columbia, MD]) or placebo soy oil. Dietary intake data were collected and analyzed by a registered dietitian. Fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography/flame ionization detection. Statistical analysis used linear mixed models. RESULTS: Twenty-one mothers were randomly assigned to either the DHA group (n=10) or the placebo group (n=11). Donor age was a median of 31 years in both groups with a mean lactational stage of 19 weeks. Dietary intake of DHA at baseline in both groups was a median of 23 mg/day (range, 0-194 mg), significantly (p<0.0001) less than the minimum recommended intake of 200 mg/day. The DHA content of milk increased in the DHA-supplemented group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The women enrolled in this study had low dietary DHA intake. Supplementation with preformed DHA at 1 g/day resulted in increased DHA concentrations in the donor milk with no adverse outcomes.

Eighty-one infants born at 30.4 (standard deviation, +/- 1.5) wk gestation were, within 10 d of birth, either enrolled to receive mother's milk (naturally containing both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids) or randomized to receive one of the infant formulas. Corn oil-based Formula A contained mainly linoleic acid (18:2 omega-6) and was low in all omega-3 fatty acids. Soy oil-based Formula B contained ample alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 omega-3) but no long-chain omega-3. Formula C, supplemented with both alpha-linolenic acid and marine oils, was comparable to human milk in long-chain omega-3. Full-field ERGs were obtained in the special care nursery from infants aged 36 and 57 wk postconception. Ten healthy preterm infants born at 35 wk gestation were tested at 36 wk postconception. Significant differences were found among groups in rod ERG function. Post hoc comparisons showed that infants fed Formula A had significantly higher rod thresholds than infants receiving long-chain omega-3 (human milk, Formula C, and intrauterine). Infants receiving Formula B had intermediate thresholds that were significantly higher than those of infants receiving intrauterine nutrition. Analysis of the leading edge of the a-wave showed that b-wave differences originated at the photoreceptor level. Differences were not present in infants at 57 wk postconception. No significant differences among groups were found in cone b-waves at 36 or 57 wk postconception. Oscillatory potentials had significantly longer implicit times at 57 wk postconception in infants fed Formula A than in infants receiving human milk.

METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial of a low-allergen maternal diet was conducted among exclusively breastfed infants presenting with colic. In the active arm, mothers excluded cow's milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, and fish from their diet; mothers in the control group continued to consume these foods. Outcomes were assessed after 7 days, as the change in cry/fuss duration over 48 hours, with validated charts. The primary end point was a reduction in cry/fuss duration of > or =25% from baseline. Mothers also assessed the responses to diet with categorical and visual analog scales. RESULTS: Of 107 infants, 90 completed the trial (mean age: 5.7 weeks; range: 2.9-8.6 weeks; 54 male infants). Infants in both groups presented with significant distress (geometric mean: low-allergen group: 690 minutes per 48 hours; control group: 631 minutes per 48 hours). In follow-up assessments on days 8 and 9, there were significantly more responders in the low-allergen group (74% vs 37%), ie, an absolute risk reduction of 37% (95% confidence interval: 18-56%). Cry/fuss duration per 48 hours was reduced by a substantially greater amount in the low-allergen group; the adjusted geometric mean ratio was 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.97), ie, an average reduction of 21% (95% confidence interval: 3-37%).

DESIGN AND SETTING: Double-blind, parallel-group, randomized study performed at Children's Hospital Medical Center. PATIENTS: Sixty infant boys (< or = 2 years old), with mild (< or = 5%) or moderate (6 to 9%) dehydration caused by acute diarrhea of less than 1 week's duration were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Infants were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either a glucose-based oral rehydration solution (ORS) (Pedialyte, Ross Laboratories, Columbus, OH) or a rice syrup solids-based ORS (Infalyte, Mead Johnson Nutritional Group, Evansville, IN). After rehydration was achieved, patients entered a maintenance phase during which, in addition to a maintenance ORS, breast milk or a soy-based formula was offered; infants older than 1 year were also given a lactose-free diet. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rehydration was judged clinically. Infants remained on a metabolic bed during the study in to separate and quantitate urine and stool output. Therefore, in addition to clinical outcome, we compared intake, output and apparent absorption and retention of fluid, sodium, and potassium between groups. RESULTS: All patients were successfully rehydrated using an ORS without the use of intravenous fluids. No differences were detected between treatment groups in time to rehydration, percentage of weight gain after rehydration, consumption of ORS to achieve rehydration, or stool output. However, the apparent sodium absorption (net intake less fecal output) was greater in the Infalyte group than the Pedialyte group during the first 24 hours. CONCLUSION: The two maintenance oral electrolyte solutions (Pedialyte and Infalyte) most commonly used in the United States are effective as rehydration solutions for infants with mild to moderate dehydration. We speculate that a strategy for oral rehydration therapy in the United States, based on the use of a single solution during the rehydration and maintenance phase, might gain additional acceptance by practicing pediatricians and family physicians.",NA,"Acute Disease Dehydration [classification] [etiology] [therapy] Diarrhea, Infantile [complications] [physiopathology] [therapy] Double-Blind Method Fluid Therapy [methods] Gastroenteritis [complications] [therapy] Severity of Illness Index Treatment Outcome Water-Electrolyte Balance Child, Preschool[checkword] Humans[checkword] Infant[checkword] Male[checkword] Sr-anaesth: sr-child: sr-compmed: sr-infectn","639-45",NA,"1995",-1

Rogelj","Effects of two probiotic additives containing Bacillus spores on carcass characteristics, blood lipids and cecal volatile fatty acids in meat type chickens","The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of two commercially available probiotic additives, containing Bacillus spores, on carcass and meat characteristics, serum lipids and concentration of cecal volatile fatty acids of meat type chickens. Birds were fed regular corn-soy meal based feed (control), supplemented with additive A, containing 1.6x10<sup>6</sup> spores per gram of feed of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis (group A) or additive B, containing the same concentration of Bacillus cereus var. toyoi spores (group B). One hundred and twenty birds (20 per replicate) were slaughtered at the age of 55days. Results showed that birds in group B had higher (p<0.05) final body weight compared to birds from group A and higher carcass weights and yield percentages compared with control. Breasts and whole legs were also heavier in group B, compared to control, but not the yield. Group A had higher yield of wings and lower abdominal fat weight compared to group B (p<0.05), but not compared with control. Total cholesterol was not affected by the dietary treatment, on contrary both probiotics elevated the LDL (p<0.05) and lowered HDL cholesterol, thus unfavourably changed animal's blood serum cholesterol profile. Both probiotics influenced the cecal fermentation, which was observed as decrease in cecal concentrations of propionic, butyric, n-butyric and n-valeric acids, but the differences compared to control group were statistically significant for group A only. It was established that probiotic additive B was more effective regarding carcass and meat part weights than additive A, however the animals from group B also had more abdominal fat and their meat had significantly higher conductivity than control group, which is not considered as beneficial. 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",NA,"animal // article // Bacillus // bacterial spore // blood // body composition // cecum // chemistry // chicken // clinical trial // controlled clinical trial // controlled study // drug effect // female // male // meat // metabolism // pH // physiology","424-33",NA,"2011",-1
