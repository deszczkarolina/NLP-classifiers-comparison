Secombes","First in-depth analysis of the novel Th2-type cytokines in salmonid fish reveals distinct patterns of expression and modulation but overlapping bioactivities","IL-4 and IL-13 are closely related canonical type-2 cytokines in mammals and have overlapping bioactivities via shared receptors. They are frequently activated together as part of the same immune response and are the signature cytokines produced by T-helper (Th)2 cells and type-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), mediating immunity against extracellular pathogens. Little is known about the origin of type-2 responses, and whether they were an essential component of the early adaptive immune system that gave a fitness advantage by limiting collateral damage caused by metazoan parasites. Two evolutionary related type-2 cytokines, IL-4/13A and IL-4/13B, have been identified recently in several teleost fish that likely arose by duplication of an ancestral IL-4/13 gene as a consequence of a whole genome duplication event that occurred at the base of this lineage. However, studies of their comparative expression levels are largely missing and bioactivity analysis has been limited to IL-4/13A in zebrafish. Through interrogation of the recently released salmonid genomes, species in which an additional whole genome duplication event has occurred, four genomic IL-4/13 loci have been identified leading to the cloning of three active genes, IL-4/13A, IL-4/13B1 and IL-4/13B2, in both rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon. Comparative expression analysis by real-time PCR in rainbow trout revealed that the IL-4/13A expression is broad and high constitutively but less responsive to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and pathogen challenge. In contrast, the expression of IL-4/13B1 and IL-4/13B2 is low constitutively but is highly induced by viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSH) infection and during proliferative kidney disease (PKD) in vivo, and by formalin-killed bacteria, PAMPs, the T cell mitogen PHA, and the T-cell cytokines IL-2 and IL-21 in vitro. Moreover, bioactive recombinant cytokines of both IL-4/13A and B were produced and found to have shared but also distinct bioactivities. Both cytokines rapidly induce the gene expression of antimicrobial peptides and acute phase proteins, providing an effector mechanism of fish type-2 cytokines in immunity. They are anti-inflammatory via up-regulation of IL-10 and down-regulation of IL-1beta and IFN-gamma. They modulate the expression of cellular markers of T cells, macrophages and B cells, the receptors of IFN-gamma, the IL-6 cytokine family and their own potential receptors, suggesting multiple target cells and important roles of fish type-2 cytokines in the piscine cytokine network. Furthermore both cytokines increased the number of IgM secreting B cells but had no effects on the proliferation of IgM+ B cells in vitro. Taken as a whole, fish IL-4/13A may provide a basal level of type-2 immunity whilst IL-4/13B, when activated, provides an enhanced type-2 immunity, which may have an important role in specific cell-mediated immunity. To our knowledge this is the first in-depth analysis of the expression, modulation and bioactivities of type-2 cytokines in the same fish species, and in any early vertebrate. It contributes to a broader understanding of the evolution of type-2 immunity in vertebrates, and establishes a framework for further studies and manipulation of type-2 cytokines in fish.","Oncotarget",-1

The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference between the two methods at each contamination level for seven matrixes from all four categories fell within the range of -0.50 to 0.50, and no statistical difference was observed at all three contamination levels for four matrixes from three categories. These results demonstrated that the Medi.Ca CC method is a reasonable alternative to the reference method for raw meat, raw poultry, raw fish, and fresh fruits.","J AOAC Int",-1

Berntssen","Investigation of pharmaceuticals in processed animal by-products by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry","There is an on-going trend for developing more sustainable salmon feed in which traditionally applied marine feed ingredients are replaced with alternatives. Processed animal products (PAPs) have been re-authorized as novel high quality protein ingredients in 2013. These PAPs may harbor undesirable substances such as pharmaceuticals and metabolites which are not previously associated with salmon farming, but might cause a potential risk for feed and food safety. To control these contaminants, an analytical strategy based on a generic extraction followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) using quadrupole time-of-flight mass analyzer (QTOF MS) was applied for wide scope screening. Quality control samples, consisting of PAP commodities spiked at 0.02, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg with 150 analytes, were injected in every sample batch to verify the overall method performance. The methodology was applied to 19 commercially available PAP samples from six different types of matrices from the EU animal rendering industry. This strategy allows assessing possible emergent risk exposition of the salmon farming industry to 1005 undesirables, including pharmaceuticals, several dyes and relevant metabolites.","Chemosphere",1

Production and degradation of chitin, a major component of the exoskeleton, is the target of some pesticides (Di/Teflubenzuron) used in management of lice on farmed fish. These chemicals inhibit molting of the salmon louse leading to the death of the parasite. We found three chitinases (LsChi1, LsChi2 and LsChi4) in the salmon louse genome. Sequence analysis and phylogeny showed that they belong to the GH18 type of chitinase group and show high sequence similarity to chitinases found in other crustaceans and in insects. Expression patterns were different for all three chitinases suggesting different functions during louse development. Furthermore, the function of LsChi2 was further explored through the use of RNA interference and infection trials. Copepodids with knock down of LsChi2 transcripts were deformed and showed a highly reduced infection success.","Exp Parasitol",-1

The results indicated that grass carp fed with food waste feeds and mix feeds achieved growth performance (based on specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio) that was similar to commercial feeds (p > 0.05). Concentrations of metalloid/metals in food waste feeds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Napier grass were relatively higher than other types of fish feeds (p < 0.05). However, most of the metalloid/metals and PAH levels in fish fed with four types of fish feeds were not significantly different (p > 0.05). These findings show that food waste feeds are suitable for using in the production of fish feed and Napier grass can be served as supplemental feeds for grass carp, and hence reducing the production cost.","Environ Sci Pollut Res Int",-1

They discuss the implementation of current control strategies, taking into account transmission patterns (vertical versus horizontal), disease reservoirs, and interactions with wild fish. In addition, the decision-making context of aquatic disease control and the institutional organisation of control strategies are considered, with particular emphasis on the roles and responsibilities of regulatory authorities and the private sector. Case studies on the emergence and control of infectious salmon anaemia worldwide and pancreas disease in Norway are used to examine some of the controversies that may influence decision making and provide lessons for the future.","Rev Sci Tech",1

Wilmers","Differential use of salmon by vertebrate consumers: implications for conservation","Salmon and other anadromous fish are consumed by vertebrates with distinct life history strategies to capitalize on this ephemeral pulse of resource availability. Depending on the timing of salmon arrival, this resource may be in surplus to the needs of vertebrate consumers if, for instance, their populations are limited by food availability during other times of year. However, the life history of some consumers enables more efficient exploitation of these ephemeral resources. Bears can deposit fat and then hibernate to avoid winter food scarcity, and highly mobile consumers such as eagles, gulls, and other birds can migrate to access asynchronous pulses of salmon availability. We used camera traps on pink, chum, and sockeye salmon spawning grounds with various run times and stream morphologies, and on individual salmon carcasses, to discern potentially different use patterns among consumers. Wildlife use of salmon was highly heterogeneous. Ravens were the only avian consumer that fed heavily on pink salmon in small streams. Eagles and gulls did not feed on early pink salmon runs in streams, and only moderately at early sockeye runs, but were the dominant consumers at late chum salmon runs, particularly on expansive river flats. Brown bears used all salmon resources far more than other terrestrial vertebrates. Notably, black bears were not observed on salmon spawning grounds despite being the most frequently observed vertebrate on roads and trails. From a conservation and management perspective, all salmon species and stream morphologies are used extensively by bears, but salmon spawning late in the year are disproportionately important to eagles and other highly mobile species that are seasonally limited by winter food availability.","PeerJ",-1

Recently, massive mortality events in the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas associated with the detection of a microvariant of the ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1microVar) have been reported in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Although the spread of disease is often viewed as a governance failure, we suggest that the development of protective measures for bivalve farming is presently held back by the lack of key scientific knowledge. In this paper, we explore the case for an integrated approach to study the management of bivalve disease, using OsHV-1 as a case study. Reconsidering the key issues by incorporating multidisciplinary science could provide a holistic understanding of OsHV-1 and increase the benefit of research to policymakers.","Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci",1

Coroneo","Hygiene and health risks associated with the consumption of edible lamellibranch molluscs","Edible lamellibranch molluscs are frequently the cause of very serious outbreaks of food poisoning. Microbiological suitability for human consumption, according to EC Reg. n. 1441/2007, is only based on two faecal bacteriological contamination parameters (Escherichia coli and Salmonella) and does not consider other microorganisms which are naturally present within the marine environment and are potentially pathogenic such as those belonging to the genus Vibrio. In this study, a total of 540 samples of edible lamellibranch molluscs (mussels, clams and oysters) bred in Sardinia were analyzed for E. coli and Salmonella, according to EC Reg n. 1441/2005, and for the presence of Vibrios of major public health interest. Environmental parameters (seawater temperature and salinity) were also recorded. The 40% (n=216) of samples were positive for Vibrio while the levels of E. coli were above the legal European limit only in 6.4% of samples. A correlation between the presence of micro-organisms of faecal origin and potentially harmful Vibrios to human health was not observed. Vibrio alginolyticus was the most common in 68% of isolated species, followed by Vibrio parahaemolyticus in 22.6%, Vibrio cholerae in 6% and Vibrio vulnificus in 1.1%. Virulence gene (trh sequence) was present in 1.6% of the V. parahaemolyticus-positive samples. The V. cholerae, V. vulnificus and V. alginolyticus strains detected were non toxigenic. The absence of genes encoding major virulence factors in the studied strains does not exclude the possibility of exposure to pathogenic strains. This study indicates the potential health risk associated with the presence of pathogenic Vibrios in edible lamellibranch molluscs bred in Sardinia, where shellfish production is very important to the local economy.","Int J Food Microbiol",1

Croft","Ecological knowledge, leadership, and the evolution of menopause in killer whales","Classic life-history theory predicts that menopause should not occur because there should be no selection for survival after the cessation of reproduction [1]. Yet, human females routinely live 30 years after they have stopped reproducing [2]. Only two other species-killer whales (Orcinus orca) and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) [3, 4]-have comparable postreproductive lifespans. In theory, menopause can evolve via inclusive fitness benefits [5, 6], but the mechanisms by which postreproductive females help their kin remain enigmatic. One hypothesis is that postreproductive females act as repositories of ecological knowledge and thereby buffer kin against environmental hardships [7, 8]. We provide the first test of this hypothesis using a unique long-term dataset on wild resident killer whales. We show three key results. First, postreproductively aged females lead groups during collective movement in salmon foraging grounds. Second, leadership by postreproductively aged females is especially prominent in difficult years when salmon abundance is low. This finding is critical because salmon abundance drives both mortality and reproductive success in resident killer whales [9, 10]. Third, females are more likely to lead their sons than they are to lead their daughters, supporting predictions of recent models [5] of the evolution of menopause based on kinship dynamics. Our results show that postreproductive females may boost the fitness of kin through the transfer of ecological knowledge. The value gained from the wisdom of elders can help explain why female resident killer whales and humans continue to live long after they have stopped reproducing.","Curr Biol",-1

Proestou","Developing tools for the study of molluscan immunity: The sequencing of the genome of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica","The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, provides important ecological and economical services, making it the target of restoration projects and supporting a significant fishery/aquaculture industry with landings valued at more than $100 million in 2012 in the United States of America. Due to the impact of infectious diseases on wild, restored, and cultured populations, the eastern oyster has been the focus of studies on host-pathogen interactions and immunity, as well as the target of selective breeding efforts for disease resistant oyster lines. Despite these efforts, relatively little is known about the genetic basis of resistance to diseases or environmental stress, not only in eastern oyster, but also in other molluscan species of commercial interest worldwide. In order to develop tools and resources to assist in the elucidation of the genomic basis of traits of commercial, biological, and ecological interest in oysters, a team of genome and bioinformatics experts, in collaboration with the oyster research community, is sequencing, assembling, and annotating the first reference genome for the eastern oyster and producing an exhaustive transcriptome from a variety of oyster developmental stages and tissues in response to a diverse set of environmentally-relevant stimuli. These transcriptomes and reference genome for the eastern oyster, added to the already available genome and transcriptomes for the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and other bivalve species, will be an essential resource for the discovery of candidate genes and markers associated with traits of commercial, biological, and ecologic importance in bivalve molluscs, including those related to host-pathogen interactions and immunity.","Fish Shellfish Immunol",-1

Bowers","Effects of Intertidal Harvest Practices on Levels of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus Bacteria in Oysters","UNLABELLED: Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus can grow rapidly in shellfish subjected to ambient air conditions, such as during intertidal exposure. In this study, levels of total and pathogenic (tdh(+) and/or trh(+)) V. parahaemolyticus and total V. vulnificus were determined in oysters collected from two study locations where intertidal harvest practices are common. Samples were collected directly off intertidal flats, after exposure (ambient air [Washington State] or refrigerated [New Jersey]), and after reimmersion by natural tidal cycles. Samples were processed using a most-probable-number (MPN) real-time PCR method for total and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus In Washington State, the mean levels of V. parahaemolyticus increased 1.38 log MPN/g following intertidal exposure and dropped 1.41 log MPN/g after reimmersion for 1 day, but the levels were dependent upon the container type utilized. Pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus levels followed a similar trend. However, V. vulnificus levels increased 0.10 log MPN/g during intertidal exposure in Washington but decreased by >1 log MPN/g after reimmersion. In New Jersey, initial levels of all vibrios studied were not significantly altered during the refrigerated sorting and containerizing process. However, there was an increase in levels after the first day of reimmersion by 0.79, 0.72, 0.92, and 0.71 log MPN/g for total, tdh(+) and trh(+) V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus, respectively. The levels of all targets decreased to those similar to background after a second day of reimmersion. These data indicate that the intertidal harvest and handling practices for oysters that were studied in Washington and New Jersey do not increase the risk of illness from V. parahaemolyticus or V. vulnificus IMPORTANCE: Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus are the leading causes of seafood-associated infectious morbidity and mortality in the United States. Vibrio spp. can grow rapidly in shellfish subjected to ambient air conditions, such as during periods of intertidal exposure. When oysters are submersed with the incoming tide, the vibrios can be purged. However, data on the rates of increase and purging during intertidal harvest are scarce, which limits the accuracy of risk assessments. The objective of this study was to help fill these data gaps by determining the levels of total and pathogenic (tdh(+) and/or trh(+)) V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus in oysters from two locations where intertidal harvest practices are common, using the current industry practices. The data generated provide insight into the responses of Vibrio spp. to relevant practices of the industry and public health, which can be incorporated into risk management decisions.","Appl Environ Microbiol",-1

Green","Effects of microplastics on European flat oysters, Ostrea edulis and their associated benthic communities","Plastic pollution is recognised as an emerging threat to aquatic ecosystems, with microplastics now the most abundant type of marine debris. Health effects caused by microplastics have been demonstrated at the species level, but impacts on ecological communities remain unknown. In this study, impacts of microplastics on the health and biological functioning of European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) and on the structure of associated macrofaunal assemblages were assessed in an outdoor mesocosm experiment using intact sediment cores. Biodegradable and conventional microplastics were added at low (0.8 mug L(-1)) and high (80 mug L(-1)) doses in the water column repeatedly for 60 days. Effects on the oysters were minimal, but benthic assemblage structures differed and species richness and the total number of organisms were approximately 1.2 and 1.5 times greater in control mesocosms than in those exposed to high doses of microplastics. Notably, abundances of juvenile Littorina sp. (periwinkles) and Idotea balthica (an isopod) were approximately 2 and 8 times greater in controls than in mesocosms with the high dose of either type of microplastic. In addition, the biomass of Scrobicularia plana (peppery furrow shell clam) was approximately 1.5 times greater in controls than in mesocosms with the high dose of microplastics. This work indicates that repeated exposure to high concentrations of microplastics could alter assemblages in an important marine habitat by reducing the abundance of benthic fauna.","Environ Pollut",1
"99","C. Cheng, F. Arritt and C. Stevenson","Controlling Listeria monocytogenes in Cold Smoked Salmon with the Antimicrobial Peptide Salmine","Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is a major safety concern for smoked salmon producers, as it can survive both the brining and smoking process in cold smoked salmon production. Salmine is a cationic antimicrobial peptide derived from the milt of salmon that has been shown to inhibit the growth of LM in vitro. Commercialization of this peptide would add value to a waste product produced when raising salmon. The purpose of this study was to determine the anti-listeria activity of salmine in smoked salmon by measuring the viable counts of LM over time. Cold smoked salmon was treated with a salmine solution or coated with agar or k-carrageenan films incorporating salmine to maintain a high surface concentration of the antimicrobial. Samples were then inoculated with approximately 1.0 x 10(3) cells of LM. The viable counts were then enumerated throughout 4 wk at 4 degrees C storage. It was found that 5 mg/g salmine delayed the growth of LM on smoked salmon. These samples had significantly (P < 0.05) lower LM counts than on the untreated samples on days 13 and 22. Edible films did not significantly (P > 0.05) improve the antimicrobial efficacy of salmine. The peptide combined with biopolymers also had lower antimicrobial activity in vitro when compared to salmine alone. These results suggest there is potential for salmine to be used as a natural hurdle to inhibit growth of LM due to post process contamination; however, future investigations for extending this effect throughout the shelf life of smoked salmon products are warranted.","J Food Sci",-1

This study aimed to generate thermal inactivation kinetics for HAV as a first step to design adequate thermal processes to control clam-associated HAV outbreaks. METHODS AND RESULTS: Survivor curves and thermal death curves were generated for different treatment times (0-6 min) at different temperatures (50-72 degrees C) and Weibull and first-order models were compared. D-values for HAV ranged from 47.37 +/- 1.23 to 1.55 +/- 0.12 min for the first-order model and 64.43 +/- 3.47 to 1.25 +/- 0.45 min for the Weibull model at temperatures from 50 to 72 degrees C. z-Values for HAV in clams were 12.97 +/- 0.59 degrees C and 14.83 +/- 0.0.28 degrees C using the Weibull and first-order model respectively. The calculated activation energies for the first-order and Weibull model were 145 and 170 kJ mole(-1) respectively. CONCLUSION: The Weibull model described the thermal inactivation behaviour of HAV better than the first-order model. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides novel and precise information on thermal inactivation kinetics of HAV in homogenized clams. This will enable reliable thermal process calculations for HAV inactivation in clams and closely related seafood.","J Appl Microbiol",-1

Characterization of CGL1 involved isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), glycoconjugate microarray, and frontal affinity chromatography (FAC). This analysis revealed that CGL1 has strict specificity for the mannose monomer and for high mannose-type N-glycans (HMTGs). Primary structure of CGL1 did not show any homology with known lectins but did show homology with proteins of the natterin family. Crystal structure of the CGL1 revealed a unique homodimer in which each protomer was composed of 2 domains related by a pseudo two-fold axis. Complex structures of CGL1 with mannose molecules showed that residues have 8 hydrogen bond interactions with O1, O2, O3, O4, and O5 hydroxyl groups of mannose. The complex interactions that are not observed with other mannose-binding lectins revealed the structural basis for the strict specificity for mannose.

A total of 256 samples from in-house cooking experiments were produced. There was little evidence of PAH formation during the grilling, frying, roasting and toasting experiments. Comparison with the raw materials used in the experiments showed little or no increase in PAH concentrations for all of the sample types, regardless of distances from the heat source, cooking mediums and intensity of cooking conditions. Barbecuing with charcoal plus wood chips however resulted in the formation of benzo[a]pyrene in most foods; for beef burgers only, barbecuing over charcoal (without the use of wood chips) gave the highest levels. In general PAH levels increased when the food was barbequed closer to the heat source. For sausages cooked over briquettes, and for beef burgers, beef and salmon cooked over charcoal, the concentration of PAHs was lower when the food was closer to the heat source. Cooking time may result in a moderate increase of PAHs in some foods, although concentrations in beef burgers appeared to fall when cooking time was extended by 50-100%.","Food Chem Toxicol",-1

Currently, the infectivity of human NoVs is poorly understood due to the lack of a cell culture system. In this study, we determined the survival of a human NoV genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) strain in seeded oyster homogenates after high-pressure processing (HPP) using a novel receptor binding assay and a gnotobiotic pig model. Pressure conditions of 350 MPa at 0 degrees C for 2 min led to a 3.7-log10 reduction in the number of viral RNA copies in oysters, as measured by the porcine gastric mucin-conjugated magnetic bead (PGM-MB) binding assay and real-time RT-PCR, whereas pressure conditions of 350 MPa at 35 degrees C for 2 min achieved only a 1-log10 reduction in the number of RNA copies. Newborn gnotobiotic piglets orally fed oyster homogenate treated at 350 MPa and 0 degrees C for 2 min did not have viral RNA shedding in feces, histologic lesions, or viral replication in the small intestine. In contrast, gnotobiotic piglets fed oysters treated at 350 MPa and 35 degrees C for 2 min had high levels of viral shedding in feces and exhibited significant histologic lesions and viral replication in the small intestine. Collectively, these data demonstrate that (i) human NoV survival estimated by an in vitro PGM-MB virus binding assay is consistent with the infectivity determined by an in vivo gnotobiotic piglet model and (ii) HPP is capable of inactivating a human NoV GII.4 strain at commercially acceptable pressure levels.","Appl Environ Microbiol",-1

METHODS AND RESULTS: Specific IgY was produced by immunizing hens with P. salmonis proteins. The IgY was obtained from egg yolks using the ammonium sulphate precipitation method and it was characterized by SDS-PAGE, Western-blot and ELISA, demonstrating that anti-P. salmonis IgY strongly reacted specifically against P. salmonis proteins. In an in vitro neutralization assay, IgY inhibited the growth of P. salmonis in liquid medium at concentrations ranging from 128 to 256 mug ml(-1) in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, IgY against P. salmonis also generates a strong protective effect on the infection of P. salmonis in salmon head kidney-1 cells. In addition, the bacteriostatic function of IgY appears to result possibly from agglutination by the interaction of IgY with surface components of the pathogen. Finally, to confirm this IgY as an alternative for salmonid treatment, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) specimens were orally inoculated with IgY. The analysis of the sera demonstrates that IgY was effectively transported by fish intestine and that this immunoglobulins maintains its properties and recognizes several proteins of P. salmonis up to 12 h after inoculation of IgY against P. salmonis. CONCLUSIONS: Specific IgY effectively inhibited the growth of P. salmonis and this immunoglobulin can be released in the Atlantic salmon sera when administered orally to fish. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We propose that this specific IgY against this fastidious micro-organism could be a useful strategy for the treatment of piscirickettsiosis.","J Appl Microbiol",-1

Kim","Development of a One-Step Duplex RT-PCR Method for the Simultaneous Detection of VP3/VP1 and VP1/P2B Regions of the Hepatitis A Virus","The simultaneous detection and accurate identification of hepatitis A virus (HAV) is critical in food safety and epidemiological studies to prevent the spread of HAV outbreaks. Towards this goal, a one-step duplex reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR method was developed targeting the VP1/P2B and VP3/VP1 regions of the HAV genome for the qualitative detection of HAV. An HAV RT-qPCR standard curve was produced for the quantification of HAV RNA. The detection limit of the duplex RT-PCR method was 2.8 x 10(1) copies of HAV. The PCR products enabled HAV genotyping analysis through DNA sequencing, which can be applied for epidemiological investigations. The ability of this duplex RT-PCR method to detect HAV was evaluated with HAV-spiked samples of fresh lettuce, frozen strawberries, and oysters. The limit of detection of the one-step duplex RT-PCR for each food model was 9.4 x 10(2) copies/20 g fresh lettuce, 9.7 x 10(3) copies/20 g frozen strawberries, and 4.1 x 10(3) copies/1.5 g oysters. Use of a one-step duplex RT-PCR method has advantages such as shorter time, decreased cost, and decreased labor owing to the single amplification reaction instead of four amplifications necessary for nested RT-PCR.","J Microbiol Biotechnol",-1

In recent years, the salmon louse has developed reduced sensitivity to EB, which may influence the results of such release experiments. We therefore tested the use of 2 anti-lice drugs: EB was administered to salmon smolts in high doses by intra-peritoneal injection and the prophylactic substance EX (SubEX) was administered by bathing. A third, untreated control group was also established. Salmon were challenged with copepodids of 2 strains of salmon lice (1 EB-sensitive strain and 1 with reduced EB-sensitivity) in mixed-group experimental tanks. At 31 d post-challenge, the numbers of pre-adult lice on treated fish were around 20% compared with the control fish, with minor or no differences between the 2 treatments and lice strains. Both treatments therefore appeared to give the smolts a high degree of protection against infestation of copepodids of salmon lice. However, significantly lower growth of the EB-treatment group indicates that bathing the fish in SubEX is less stressful for smolts than intra-peritoneal injection of EB.","Dis Aquat Organ",-1

PAH exposure and their resultant bioaccumulation in molluscs can cause a range of serious physiological effects in the affected animals. To examine the molecular response of these xenobiotics in bivalves, Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata) were exposed to pyrene and fluoranthene for seven days. Chemical analysis of the soft-tissue of PAH stressed S. glomerata confirmed that pyrene and fluoranthene could be bioaccumulated by these oysters. RNA-Seq analysis of PAH-exposed S. glomerata showed a total of 765 transcripts differentially expressed between control and PAH-stressed oysters. Closer examination of the transcripts revealed a range genes encoding enzymes involved in PAH detoxification (e.g. cytochrome P450), innate immune responses (e.g. pathogen recognition, phagocytosis) and protein synthesis. Overall, pyrene and fluoranthene exposure appears to have resulted in a suppression of pathogen recognition and some protein synthesis processes, whereas transcripts of genes encoding proteins involved in clearance of cell debris and some transcripts of genes involved in PAH detoxification were induced in response to the stressors. Pyrene and fluoranthene exposure thus invoked a complex molecular response in S. glomerata, with results suggesting that oysters focus on removing the stressors from their system and dealing with the downstream effects of PAH exposure, potentially at the exclusion of other, less immediate concerns (e.g. protection from infection).","Aquat Toxicol",-1

Vibrio parahaemolyticus has been recognized as a cause of gastroenteritis linked to the consumption of seafood, particularly oysters consumed raw or inadequately cooked or contaminated after cooking. In Taiwan, V. parahaemolyticus is the most prevalent foodborne pathogen in Taiwan. However, information is limited about the average risks per serving of raw oysters. Purpose. This study aimed to develop a risk assessment of V. parahaemolyticus associated with raw oysters produced and consumed in Taiwan and suggest effective interventions steps to control the risks. Methods. Interviews with producers and processors were carried out to collect data regarding the current production, processing, and consumption of oysters in Taiwan. An exposure assessment was performed to estimate the prevalence and density of V. parahaemolyticus in raw oysters from harvest to consumption with data from literatures and sample analysis. The data was combined with a Beta-Poisson dose-response model to estimate the probability of illness. Results. Results indicated oyster production chain started with harvest, wholesaling and then retailing before consumption. After harvested, shucked oysters were washed by tap water. The oysters were then packed by styrofoam box with crushed ice and transported in non-refrigerated vehicles to wholesalers and then to retailers. The estimated average risks per serving of raw oysters was 2.2 * 10-4. The influential interventions on the risk of illness were transport temperature and washing water temperature. Significance. The findings could be used by the food regulatory agencies in Taiwan to establish seafood food safety policies and develop risk management strategies to reduce V. parahaemolyticus risk associated with the consumption of oysters.","Journal of Food Protection",-1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on antioxidant status caused by ibuprofen (IBU) in oysters Crassostrea gigas exposed for 1, 4, and 7 days at concentrations 1 and 100 mug L(-1). Levels of IBU in tissues of oysters, as well as cell viability of hemocytes, were measured. The transcription of cytochrome P450 genes (CYP2AU2, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, CYP30C1), glutathione S-transferase isoforms (GST-omega-like and GST-pi-like), cyclooxygenase-like (COX-like), fatty acid binding protein-like (FABP-like), caspase-like, heat shock protein-like (HSP70-like), catalase-like (CAT-like), and the activity of catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were also evaluated in the gills of oysters. The highest levels of IBU were observed in animals exposed to 100 mug L(-1). A significant upregulation of CYP2AU1, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, GST-omega-like, GST-pi-like, COX-like, and FABP-like was observed in oysters exposed to IBU under different experimental conditions. Oysters exposed to 1 mug L(-1) for 7 days showed a significantly higher transcription of CYP2AU2, CYP356A1, CYP3071A1, GST-omega-like, and GST-pi-like but lower GR activity. In conclusion, C. gigas exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IBU (1 mug L(-1)) exhibited increased transcription of certain genes and alterations on antioxidant and auxiliary enzymes, which could, in the the long term, cause damages to exposed organisms.","Environ Sci Pollut Res Int",-1

Vibrio cholerae-related disease is occasionally attributed to seafood, but V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus are the primary targets of postharvest processing (PHP) efforts in the United States, as they pose the greatest threat to the industry. Most successful PHP treatments for Vibrio reduction also kill the molluscs and are not suitable for the lucrative half-shell market, while nonlethal practices are generally less effective. Therefore, novel intervention strategies for Vibrio reduction are needed for live oyster products. Chitosan is a bioactive derivative of chitin that is generally recognized as safe as a food additive by the FDA, and chitosan microparticles (CMs) were investigated in the present study as a potential PHP treatment for live oyster applications. Treatment of broth cultures with 0.5% (wt/vol) CMs resulted in growth cessation of V. cholerae, V. vulnificus, and V. parahaemolyticus, reducing culturable levels to nondetectable amounts after 3 h in three independent experiments. Furthermore, a similar treatment in artificial seawater at 4, 25, and 37 degrees C reduced V. vulnificus levels by ca. 7 log CFU/ml after 24 h of exposure, but 48 h of exposure and elevated temperature were required to achieve similar results for V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae. Live oysters that either were artificially inoculated or contained natural populations of V. vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus showed significant and consistent reductions following CM treatment (5%) compared to the amounts in the untreated controls. Thus, the results strongly support the promising potential for the application of CMs as a PHP treatment to reduce Vibrio spp. in intact live oysters.","Appl Environ Microbiol",1

The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and viral surrogates of human norovirus (HuNoV) (bacteriophage MS2 and murine norovirus [MNV]) in food over time. HAV, MNV, and MS2 were inoculated onto either the digestive gland of oysters or the surface of fresh peppers, and their survival on these food matrices was measured under various temperature (4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 40 degrees C) and relative humidity (RH) (50% and 70%) conditions. Inoculated viruses were recovered from food samples and quantified by a plaque assay at predetermined time points over 2 weeks (0, 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 days). Virus survival was influenced primarily by temperature. On peppers at 40 degrees C and at 50% RH, >4- and 6-log reductions of MNV and HAV, respectively, occurred within 1 day. All three viruses survived better on oysters. In addition, HAV survived better at 70% RH than at 50% RH. The survival data for HAV, MS2, and MNV were fit to three different mathematical models (linear, Weibull, and biphasic models). Among them, the biphasic model was optimum in terms of goodness of fit. The results of this study suggest that major foodborne viruses such as HAV and HuNoV can survive over prolonged periods of time with a limited reduction in numbers. Because a persistence of foodborne virus on contaminated foods was observed, precautionary preventive measures should be performed.","Appl Environ Microbiol",-1

Heavily infected salmon become runts, probably due to vision impairment or blindness. The salmon are likely infected by waterborne actinospores, released by an alternating annelid host, but the life cycle of P. pseudobranchicola is unknown. Seatrout and Arctic charr have been considered possible hosts for the parasite, but firm evidence has been lacking. FINDINGS: We show for the first time the presence of mature spores of P. pseudobranchicola in seatrout. The seatrout were infected with high intensities of P. pseudobranchicola in the pseudobranchs in early April. The presence of mature spores in early spring suggests that the fish had been infected late the previous year, a pattern of infection similar to that observed for farmed salmon stocked in autumn. Although heavily infected, the fish did not display any symptoms consistent with parvicapsulosis. The results suggest that the life cycle of P. pseudobranchicola is more adapted to seatrout, rather than to Atlantic salmon. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mature spores of P. pseudobranchicola in seatrout confirms that seatrout is a natural host for this myxosporean and this is also the first record of these spores in the pseudobranch of a wild salmonid. Furthermore, wild trout from non-farming areas may become heavily infected with P. pseudobranchicola, developing pseudobranch pathology resembling that of farmed Atlantic salmon suffering from parvicapsulosis.","Parasit Vectors",1

Molluscs produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to changes in the environment and pollution. These ROS induce oxidative damage in biomolecules. The main objective of this study was to evaluate pollution in the estuary and the subsequent oxidative stress in C. corteziensis oysters during the 2010 production cycle. For this aim, we performed monthly samplings in the oyster farms from January to May. We took water samples to quantify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and metal content; also, we evaluated oxidative damage (lipoperoxidation, lipidic hydroperoxides, protein oxidation) and enzyme activity (CAT, SOD, GPx, GST and AChE) in oyster gills. The results show the presence of Cu, Fe, Mn, naphthalene, benz[a]anthracene, pyrene, benz[a]pyrene and benzo[k]fluoranthene. On the other hand, AChE activity was not inhibited, which suggests that organophosphorus pollutants or carbamates were absent. Regarding oxidative stress, oysters from the estuary had oxidative damage in lipids, not proteins, and altered antioxidant enzyme activity, when compared to control organisms. Interestingly, we did not observe any correlation between the pollutants and the oxidative stress parameters evaluated in this study. Thus, we cannot rule out that a synergistic effect between the environmental variables and the pollutants is causing the oxidative stress in these oysters.","Comp Biochem Physiol A Mol Integr Physiol",-1

Our understanding and management of such diseases are of critical importance as aquaculture is an important aspect of dealing with the approaching worldwide food shortage. Although some bacteria of the Vibrio genus isolated from diseased oysters have been demonstrated to be pathogenic by experimental infection, direct causality has not been established. Little is known about the dynamics of how the bacterial population hosted by oysters changes during disease progression. Combining experimental ecology, a high-throughput infection assay and genome sequencing, we show that the onset of disease in oysters is associated with progressive replacement of diverse benign colonizers by members of a phylogenetically coherent virulent population. Although the virulent population is genetically diverse, all members of that population can cause disease. Comparative genomics across virulent and nonvirulent populations identified candidate virulence factors that were clustered in population-specific genomic regions. Genetic analyses revealed that one gene for a candidate virulent factor, a putative outer membrane protein, is necessary for infection of oysters. Finally, analyses of oyster mortality following experimental infection suggest that disease onset can be facilitated by the presence of nonvirulent strains. This is a new form of polymicrobial disease, in which nonpathogenic strains contribute to increase mortality.","Isme j",-1

A new variant, OsHV-1 muVar, has been associated with recurrent mortality events in Europe since 2008. Epidemiological data collection is key for global risk assessment; however little is known about health status and genotypes present in European wild oyster beds. Most studies to date have involved only cultivated individuals during mortality events, and reported low genotype diversity. With this study, conducted along the Italian coasts, we investigated for the first time the presence of OsHV-1 in European natural oyster beds. Analysis of three genomic regions revealed the presence of at least nine different genotypes, including two variants close to the OsHV-1 reference, known since the early 1990s but with no European record reported since 2010, and highlights relevant genotype diversity in natural environment. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished two distinct clusters and geographical distribution of genotypes, with the exception of a variant very closely related to the muVar, which appeared the single genotype present in all the Adriatic sites. Interestingly, these wild symptom free populations could represent, in Europe, an accessible alternative to the import of OsHV-1-resistant oyster strains from the East Pacific, the native area of C. gigas, avoiding the high-risk of non-native marine species and new pathogen introductions.","J Invertebr Pathol",-1

In this study, the potential for dietary mitigation of the disease using different polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) profiles was assessed in rainbow trout. We experimentally infected fish with salmonid alphavirus subtype 1 (SAV-1), the causative agent of SPD. These fish were fed two diets with different n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio (high omega 3, 3.08, and high omega 6, 0.87). We assessed the influence of the diets on the fatty acid composition of the heart at 0 days post infection (d.p.i.)

Viral E1 and E2 glycoprotein genes were quantified by two absolute real-time PCRs in all the organs sampled, and significantly lower levels of the virus were evident in the organs of fish fed with high omega 6. Characteristic pathological lesions were identified in infected fish as early as 5d.p.i., with no significant differences in the pathology lesion scores between the two dietary regimes. This study shows that decreasing the n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio in experimental diets of rainbow trout changes the fatty acid content of the fish, and is associated with reduced SAV-1 replication in rainbow trout.","Vet Microbiol",-1

However, when participants receive negative environmental information on farmed fish or harvesting wild species, willingness to pay falls by more than the positive effect of ecolabeling.

We tested 4 model simulations to see which best represented empirical data from two sources: (1) observed lice infection levels reported by farms; and (2) experimental data from a vertical exposure experiment where fish were forced to swim at different depths with a lice-barrier technology. Model simulations tested were different development time to the infective stage (35 or 50 degrees -days), with or without the presence of temperature-controlled vertical behaviour of lice early planktonic stages (naupliar stages). The best model fit occurred with a 35 degrees -day development time to the infective stage, and temperature-controlled vertical behaviour. We applied this model to predict the effectiveness of depth-based preventive lice-barrier technologies. Both simulated and experimental data revealed that hindering fish from swimming close to the surface efficiently reduced lice infection. Moreover, while our model simulation predicted that this preventive technology is widely applicable, its effectiveness will depend on environmental conditions. Low salinity surface waters reduce the effectiveness of this technology because salmon lice avoid these conditions, and can encounter the fish as they sink deeper in the water column. Correctly parameterized and validated salmon lice dispersal models can predict the impact of preventive approaches to control this parasite and become an essential tool in lice management strategies.","Prev Vet Med",-1

Good","Influence of Fishmeal-Free Diets on Microbial Communities in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Recirculation Aquaculture Systems","UNLABELLED: Reliance on fishmeal as a primary protein source is among the chief economic and environmental concerns in aquaculture today. Fishmeal-based feeds often require harvest from wild fish stocks, placing pressure on natural ecosystems and causing price instability. Alternative diet formulations without the use of fishmeal provide a potential solution to this challenge. Although the impact of alternative diets on fish performance, intestinal inflammation, palatability, and gut microbiota has been a topic of recent interest, less is known about how alternative feeds impact the aquaculture environment as a whole. The recent focus on recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) and the closed-containment approach to raising food fish highlights the need to maintain stable environmental and microbiological conditions within a farm environment. Microbial stability in RAS biofilters is particularly important, given its role in nutrient processing and water quality in these closed systems. If and how the impacts of alternative feeds on microbial communities in fish translate into changes to the biofilters are not known. We tested the influence of a fishmeal-free diet on the microbial communities in RAS water, biofilters, and salmon microbiomes using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene V6 hypervariable region amplicon sequencing. We grew Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to market size in six replicate RAS tanks, three with traditional fishmeal diets and three with alternative-protein, fishmeal-free diets. We sampled intestines and gills from market-ready adult fish, water, and biofilter medium in each corresponding RAS unit. Our results provide data on how fish diet influences the RAS environment and corroborate previous findings that diet has a clear influence on the microbiome structure of the salmon intestine, particularly within the order Lactobacillales (lactic acid bacteria). We conclude that the strong stability of taxa likely involved in water quality processing regardless of diet (e.g., Nitrospira) may further alleviate concerns regarding the use of alternative feeds in RAS operations. IMPORTANCE: The growth of the aquaculture industry has outpaced terrestrial livestock production and wild-capture fisheries for over 2 decades, currently producing nearly 50% of all seafood consumed globally. As wild-capture fisheries continue to decline, aquaculture's role in food production will grow, and it will produce an estimated 62% of all seafood consumed in 2020. A significant environmental concern of the industry is the reliance on fishmeal as a primary feed ingredient, as its production still requires harvest from wild fisheries. Our study adds to the growing body of literature on the feasibility of alternative, fishmeal-free diets. Specifically, we asked how fishmeal-free diets influence microbial communities in recirculating salmon farms. Unlike previous studies, we extended our investigation beyond the microbiome of the fish itself and asked how alterative diets influence microbial communities in water and critical biofilter habitats. We found no evidence for adverse effects of alternative diets on any microbial habitat within the farm.","Appl Environ Microbiol",-1

We hypothesized that exposure of Chinook Salmon to the less-virulent parasite genotype (II) prior to the more virulent parasite genotype (I) would decrease disease and/or result in fewer mature parasites compared with fish only infected with the more virulent genotype. To test this hypothesis, fish were challenged in a combination of field and laboratory exposures, and we measured infection prevalence, percent morbidity, and mature parasite production. Neither mortality nor mature parasite production were reduced when fish were exposed to genotype II prior to genotype I compared with fish exposed only to genotype I, suggesting that protection against C. shasta using a less-virulent genotype of the parasite does not occur.","J Aquat Anim Health",-1

A sudden increase in the prevalence of Rs-Ag experienced caused extensive problems to this industry as eggs from positive fish are discarded. The prevalence and level of Rs-Ag were examined in resident and anadromous salmonids in the River Ellidaar system and the progress of Rs-Ag in a cohort of salmon followed. Both prevalence and Rs-Ag levels were high in resident salmonids and emigrating salmon smolts in the river system. When the smolts re-entered their home river as adults the following summer, they were almost free of Rs-Ag, but the longer they stayed in the river, the more Rs-Ag they acquired; the majority being positive at spawning. This study demonstrates a high level of Rs-Ag in salmonids in the River Ellidaar system which significantly reduces in the salmon during its seawater phase. Accordingly, it seems ideal to sample salmon broodfish as soon as possible after ascending the river and subsequently transfer to Rs-free environment for storage until stripping, which could result in lower Rs-prevalence and minimize the problems that stock enhancement programmes have faced due to Rs-positive wild broodfish.","J Fish Dis",-1

A rapid and selective concentration method is necessary for the recovery of HAV from contaminated oysters prior to detection using PCR. In this study, ricin extracted from castor beans (Ricinus communis) was tested as an alternative to antibody used in immunomagnetic separation while concentrating HAV prior to its detection using reverse transcription PCR. Initially, the extracted proteins from castor beans were fractionated into 13 fractions by gel filtration chromatography. Pretreatment of different protein fractions showed a variation in binding of HAV viral protein (VP) 1 to oyster digestive tissue in the range of 25.9 to 63.9%. The protein fraction, which caused the highest reduction in binding of VP1 to the tissue, was identified as ricin A by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Ricin A could significantly inhibit binding of VP1 to the tissue with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.5 mug/ml and a maximal inhibitory concentration of 105.2%. The result showed that the rate of inhibition of HAV binding to tissue was higher compared to the rate of ricin itself binding to HAV (slope: 0.0029 versus 0.00059). However, ricin A concentration showed a higher correlation to the relative binding of ricin itself to HAV than the inhibition of binding of HAV to the tissue (coefficient of determination, R(2): 0.9739 versus 0.6804). In conclusion, ricin A-linked magnetic bead separation combined with reverse transcription PCR can successfully detect HAV in artificially seeded oyster digestive tissue up to a 10(-4) dilution of the virus stock (titer: 10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose per ml).","J Food Prot",-1

Dafre","Gills as a glutathione-dependent metabolic barrier in Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas: Absorption, metabolism and excretion of a model electrophile","The mercapturic acid pathway (MAP) is a major phase II detoxification route, comprising the conjugation of electrophilic substances to glutathione (GSH) in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes. In mammals, GSH-conjugates are exported from cells, and the GSH-constituent amino acids (Glu/Gly) are subsequently removed by ectopeptidases. The resulting Cys-conjugates are reabsorbed and, finally, a mercapturic acid is generated through N-acetylation. This pathway, though very well characterized in mammals, is poorly studied in non-mammalian biological models, such as bivalve mollusks, which are key organisms in aquatic ecosystems, aquaculture activities and environmental studies. In the present work, the compound 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was used as a model electrophile to study the MAP in Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas. Animals were exposed to 10muM CDNB and MAP metabolites were followed over 24h in the seawater and in oyster tissues (gills, digestive gland and hemolymph). A rapid decay was detected for CDNB in the seawater (half-life 1.7h), and MAP metabolites peaked in oyster tissues as soon as 15min for the GSH-conjugate, 1h for the Cys-conjugate, and 4h for the final metabolite (mercapturic acid). Biokinetic modeling of the MAP supports the fast CDNB uptake and metabolism, and indicated that while gills are a key organ for absorption, initial biotransformation, and likely metabolite excretion, hemolymph is a possible milieu for metabolite transport along different tissues. CDNB-induced GSH depletion (4h) was followed by increased GST activity (24h) in the gills, but not in the digestive gland. Furthermore, the transcript levels of glutamate-cysteine ligase, coding for the rate limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis, and two phase II biotransformation genes (GSTpi and GSTo), presented a fast (4h) and robust ( approximately 6-70 fold) increase in the gills. Waterborne exposure to electrophilic compounds affected gills, but not digestive gland, while intramuscular exposure was able to modulate biochemical parameters in both tissues. This study is the first evidence of a fully functional and interorgan MAP pathway in bivalves. Hemolymph was shown to be responsible for the metabolic interplay among tissues, and gills, acting as a powerful GSH-dependent metabolic barrier against waterborne electrophilic substances, possibly also participating in metabolite excretion into the sea water. Altogether, experimental and modeled data fully agree with the existence of a classical mechanism for phase II xenobiotic metabolism and excretion in bivalves.","Aquat Toxicol",-1

This study tested the hypothesis that specific regulatory changes enable a portion of the invading Salmonella population to colonize oysters. An in vivo promoter probe library screen identified 19 unique regions as regulated during colonization. The mutants in the nearest corresponding downstream genes were tested for colonization defects in oysters. Only one mutation, in ssrB, resulted in a significantly reduced ability to colonize oysters compared to that of wild-type Salmonella. Because ssrB regulates Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2)-dependent infections in vertebrate macrophages, the possibility that ssrB mediated colonization of oyster hemocytes in a similar manner was examined. However, no difference in hemocyte colonization was observed. The complementary hypothesis that signal exchange between Salmonella and the oyster's native microbial community aids colonization was also tested. Signals that triggered responses in quorum sensing (QS) reporters were shown to be produced by oyster-associated bacteria and present in oyster tissue. However, no evidence for signal exchange was observed in vivo. The sdiA reporter responded to salinity, suggesting that SdiA may also have a role in environmental sensing. Overall, this study suggests the initial colonization of live oysters by Salmonella is controlled by a limited number of regulators, including ssrB.","Appl Environ Microbiol",-1

In the present study, a euryhaline oyster, Crassostrea hongkongensis, was collected from different sites of the Pearl River estuary; and various physiological (heart rate, alkaline phosphatase as homeostatic regulation, and glycogen as energy reserve) and cytological (lysosomal membrane stability) biomarkers were quantified to assess this species as a potential bioindicator of metal pollution in contaminated areas. Large variations of metal accumulation levels in the oysters were documented, especially for copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), chromium, and nickel (Ni). Among these metals, the authors demonstrated significant correlations between the digestive gland metal accumulation of Cu, Zn, and Ni and the cellular homeostasis (alkaline phosphatase) and glycogen reserves. Heart rate was positively correlated with Cd but negatively correlated with Cu and Zn concentrations in the gills. Lysosomal membrane stability was significantly inhibited at the most contaminated sites but had no relationship with the accumulated metal concentrations.

The diversity of potential sources contributes to the likelihood of contaminated marine waters and sediments and increases the probability of uptake by marine organisms. Despite widespread recognition of direct and indirect pathways for contaminant deposition and organismal exposure in coastal systems, spatial and temporal variability in contaminant composition, deposition, and uptake patterns are still poorly known. We investigated these patterns for a suite of persistent legacy contaminants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and chemicals of emerging concern including pharmaceuticals within two Oregon coastal estuaries (Coos and Netarts Bays). In the more urbanized Coos Bay, native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) tissue had approximately twice the number of PCB congeners at over seven times the total concentration, yet fewer PBDEs at one-tenth the concentration as compared to the more rural Netarts Bay. Different pharmaceutical suites were detected during each sampling season. Variability in contaminant types and concentrations across seasons and between species and media (organisms versus sediment) indicates the limitation of using indicator species and/or sampling annually to determine contaminant loads at a site or for specific species. The results indicate the prevalence of legacy contaminants and CECs in relatively undeveloped coastal environments highlighting the need to improve policy and management actions to reduce contaminant releases into estuarine and marine waters and to deal with legacy compounds that remain long after prohibition of use. Our results point to the need for better understanding of the ecological and human health risks of exposure to the diverse cocktail of pollutants and harmful compounds that will continue to leach from estuarine sediments over time.","Sci Total Environ",1

The preservation of genetic material from improved stocks or from the original population is extremely important for the oyster aquaculture industry to prevent the potential impacts of epidemic diseases and natural disasters. The Portuguese oyster, Crassostrea angulata, was the most important species commercialized by the shellfish industry. However, inadequate management of this industry and pathology occurrences resulted in a significant decrease in natural populations. For this reason, in this work a successful sperm cryopreservation protocol for this important species has been developed for the first time. Different internal cryoprotectants (DMSO, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and methanol) at several concentrations (5, 10, 20%), containers (straws vs cryovials) and freezing rates (slow and fast rates) were tested. Cryoprotectant toxicity tests corroborated that this assay did not take into account the following steps of cryopreservation protocol as sperm agglutination. A fast freezing rate of cells diluted in10% DMSO and the use of straws as containers were the best cryopreservation conditions for Portuguese oyster sperm. Finally, fertilization assays confirmed the efficiency of the cryopreservation protocol in oyster sperm. These results demonstrated that different susceptibilities have been detected concerning sperm cryopreservation depending on oyster species or genetic material composition.","Gen Comp Endocrinol",-1

These contaminants elicit biological responses in the exposed organisms. Proteomic analysis is a powerful tool in environmental toxicology by evidencing alterations in protein expression due to exposure to contaminants and by providing a useful framework for the development of new potential biomarkers. The aim of this study was to determine changes in protein expression signatures (PES) in the digestive gland of oysters Crassostrea gigas transplanted to two farming areas (LIS and RIB) and to one area contaminated by sanitary sewage (BUC) after 14 days of exposure. This species is one of the most cultivated molluscs in the world. The identified proteins are related to the cytoskeleton (CKAP5 and ACT2), ubiquitination pathway conjugation (UBE3C), G protein-coupled receptor and signal transduction (SVEP1), and cell cycle/division (CCNB3). CKAP5 showed higher expression in oysters kept at BUC in comparison with those kept at the farming areas, while ACT2, UBE3C, SVEP1, and CCNB3 were suppressed. The results suggest that these changes might lead to DNA damage, apoptosis, and interference with the immune system in oyster C. gigas exposed to sewage and give initial information on PES of C. gigas exposed to sanitary sewage, which can subsequently be useful in the development of more sensitive tools for biomonitoring coastal areas, particularly those devoted mainly to oyster farming activities.","Environ Sci Pollut Res Int",-1

Epidemiological evidence suggests that hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the most common pathogen transmitted to humans via bivalve mollusks such as clams, cockles, mussels, and oysters. Potential control of HAV-related foodborne illness outbreaks associated with clam consumption can be achieved by use of adequate thermal processes. Purpose. The purpose of this study was (i) to characterize the thermal inactivation behavior of HAV in clams, (ii) to compare first-order and Weibull models in describing the data in terms of selected statistical parameters, and (iii) to calculate z-values and activation energy for each model. Methods. Fresh clams were purchased from a local seafood market and homogenized using a Waring blender. Five milliliters of HAV stock (7.04 1.34 log PFU/ml) were added to 25 g of homogenized clams and held at 4ÁC for 24 h. An aliquot (6 ml) of the homogenized inoculated clam sample was added to moisture barrier vacuum-sealed plastic bags. Thermal inactivation was performed for up to 6 min at 50, 56, 60, 65 and 72ÁC. Weibull and first-order models were compared to describe survivor curve kinetics and thermal death times. A comparison test (ANOVA, Post Hoc test) was used to analyze the effects of temperature and time on survival ratio. Results. The D-values for HAV were in the range of 47.37 1.23 to 1.55 0.12 min for the first-order model and 64.43 3.47 to 1.25 0.45 min for the Weibull model at temperatures ranging from 50 to 72ÁC, respectively. The z-values determined for HAV in clams were 12.97 0.59ÁC using the Weibull model and 14.83 0.0.28ÁC using the first-order model. The calculated activation energies for the first-order model and the Weibull model were 145 and 170 kJ/mole, respectively. Significance.

Due to the relatively recent population growth of coastal settlements in Australia, we were able to evaluate the collapse and extirpation of native oyster reefs (Ostrea angasi) over the course of a commercial fishery. We used historical records to quantify commercial catch of O. angasi in southern Australia from early colonization, around 1836, to some of the last recorded catches in 1944 and used our estimates of catch and effort to map their past distribution and assess oyster abundance over 180 years. Significant declines in catch and effort occurred from 1886 to 1946 and no native oyster reefs occur today, but historically oyster reefs extended across more than 1,500 km of coastline. That oyster reefs were characteristic of much of the coastline of South Australia from 1836 to 1910 appears not to be known because there is no contemporary consideration of their ecological and economic value. Based on the concept of a shifted baseline, we consider this contemporary state to reflect a collective, intergenerational amnesia. Our model of generational amnesia accounts for differences in intergenerational expectations of food, economic value, and ecosystem services of nearshore areas. An ecological system that once surrounded much of the coast and possibly the past presence of oyster reefs altogether may be forgotten and could not only undermine progress towards their recovery, but also reduce our expectations of these coastal ecosystems.","Conserv Biol",-1

Levels of these pathogens in oysters can increase during routine antifouling aquaculture practices involving dry storage in ambient air conditions. After storage, common practice is to resubmerge these stored oysters to reduce elevated Vv and Vp levels, but evidence proving the effectiveness of this practice is lacking. This study examined the changes in Vv and in total and pathogenic (thermostable direct hemolysin gene and the tdh-related hemolysin gene, tdh+ and trh+) Vp levels in oysters after 5 or 24 h of dry storage (28 to 32 degrees C), followed by resubmersion (27 to 32 degrees C) for 14 days. For each trial, replicate oyster samples were collected at initial harvest, after dry storage, after 7 days, and after 14 days of resubmersion. Oysters not subjected to dry storage were collected and analyzed to determine natural undisturbed vibrio levels (background control). Vibrio levels were measured using a most-probable-number enrichment followed by real-time PCR. After storage, vibrio levels (excluding tdh+ and trh+ Vp during 5-h storage) increased significantly (P < 0.001) from initial levels. After 7 days of resubmersion, Vv and total Vp levels (excluding total Vp in oysters stored for 5 h) were not significantly different (P < 0.1) from levels in background oysters. Vv and total and pathogenic Vp levels were not significantly different (P > 0.1) from levels in background oysters after 14 days of resubmersion, regardless of dry storage time. These data demonstrate that oyster resubmersion after dry storage at elevated ambient temperatures allows vibrio levels to return to those of background control samples. These results can be used to help minimize the risk of Vv and Vp illnesses and to inform the oyster industry on the effectiveness of routine storing and resubmerging of aquaculture oysters.","J Food Prot",-1

Feces and tissues were collected at 0, 12, 24, 72, and 120 h, post-exposure, and analyzed for concentrations of titanium by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Results indicated that the capture and ingestion (i.e., transfer to the gut) of TiO2 nanoparticles by both mussels and oysters was not dependent on the presence of marine snow, and weight-standardized clearance rates of bivalves exposed to TiO2 nanoparticles were not significantly different than those of unexposed control animals. Both species ingested about half of the nanoparticles to which they were exposed, and >90% of the nanoparticles were egested in feces within 12 h, post-exposure. The findings of this study demonstrate that mussels and oysters can readily ingest both Titan and P25 nanoparticles regardless of the form in which they are encountered, but depurate these materials over a short period of time. Importantly, bioaccumulation of Titan and P25 nanoparticles does not occur in mussels and oysters following exposures of up to 6 h.","Mar Environ Res",-1

Tocher","Modulation of selenium tissue distribution and selenoprotein expression in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) fed diets with graded levels of plant ingredients","Increased substitution of marine ingredients by terrestrial plant products in aquafeeds has been proven to be suitable for Atlantic salmon farming. However, a reduction in n-3 long-chain PUFA is a consequence of this substitution. In contrast, relatively little attention has been paid to the effects of fishmeal and oil substitution on levels of micronutrients such as Se, considering fish are major sources of this mineral for human consumers. To evaluate the effects of dietary marine ingredient substitution on tissue Se distribution and the expression of Se metabolism and antioxidant enzyme genes, Atlantic salmons were fed three feeds based on commercial formulations with increasing levels of plant proteins (PP) and vegetable oil. Lipid content in flesh did not vary at any sampling point, but it was higher in the liver of 1 kg of fish fed higher PP. Fatty acid content reflected dietary input and was related to oxidation levels (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances). Liver had the highest Se levels, followed by head kidney, whereas the lowest contents were found in brain and gill. The Se concentration of flesh decreased considerably with high levels of substitution, reducing the added value of fish consumption. Only the brain showed significant differences in glutathione peroxidase, transfer RNA selenocysteine 1-associated protein 1b and superoxide dismutase expression, whereas no significant regulation of Se-related genes was found in liver. Although Se levels in the diets satisfied the essential requirements of salmon, high PP levels led to a reduction in the supply of this essential micronutrient.","Br J Nutr",-1

The uptake pathway can affect metal toxicity. Saccostrea glomerata were exposed to cadmium through cadmium-spiked suspended sediments (19 and 93mug/g dry mass) and cadmium-enriched phytoplankton (1.6-3mug/g dry mass) and cadmium uptake and effects measured. Oysters accumulated appreciable amounts of cadmium from both low and high cadmium spiked suspended sediment treatments (5.9+/-0.4mug/g and 23+/-2mug/g respectively compared to controls 0.97+/-0.05mug/g dry mass). Only a small amount of cadmium was accumulated by ingestion of cadmium-enriched phytoplankton (1.9+/-0.1mug/g compared to controls 1.2+/-0.1mug/g). In the cadmium spiked suspended sediment experiments, most cadmium was desorbed from sediments and cadmium concentrations in S. glomerata were significantly related to dissolved cadmium concentrations (4-21mug/L) in the overlying water. In the phytoplankton feeding experiment cadmium concentrations in overlying water were <0.01mug/L. In both exposure experiments, cadmium-exposed oysters showed a significant reduction in total antioxidant capacity and significantly increased lipid peroxidation and percentage of destabilised lysosomes. Destabilised lysosomes in the suspended sediments experiments also resulted from stress of exposure to the suspended sediments. The study demonstrated that exposure to cadmium via suspended sediments and to low concentrations of cadmium through the ingestion of phytoplankton, can cause sublethal stress to S. glomerata.","Aquat Toxicol",-1

The consistent presence of Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) in HSMI diseased fish along with the correlation of viral load and antigen with development of lesions has supported the supposition that PRV is the etiologic agent of this condition; yet the absence of an in vitro culture system to demonstrate disease causation and the widespread prevalence of this virus in the absence of disease continues to obfuscate the etiological role of PRV with regard to HSMI. In this study, we explore the infectivity and disease causing potential of PRV from western North America-a region now considered endemic for PRV but without manifestation of HSMI-in challenge experiments modeled upon previous reports associating PRV with HSMI. We identified that western North American PRV is highly infective by intraperitoneal injection in Atlantic salmon as well as through cohabitation of both Atlantic and Sockeye salmon. High prevalence of viral RNA in peripheral blood of infected fish persisted for as long as 59 weeks post-challenge. Nevertheless, no microscopic lesions, disease, or mortality could be attributed to the presence of PRV, and only a minor transcriptional induction of the antiviral Mx gene occurred in blood and kidney samples during log-linear replication of viral RNA. Comparative analysis of the S1 segment of PRV identified high similarity between this North American sequence and previous sequences associated with HSMI, suggesting that factors such as viral co-infection, alternate PRV strains, host condition, or specific environmental circumstances may be required to cause this disease.","PLoS One",-1

Variable innate immune responses at the louse-attachment site contribute to differences in susceptibility among species such that members of Salmo spp. are more susceptible to infection than those of some Oncorhynchus spp. Relatively little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to disease resistance or susceptibility to L. salmonis in salmon. Here, we utilize histochemistry and transcriptomics in a comparative infection model with susceptible (Atlantic, sockeye) and resistant (coho) salmon. At least three cell populations (MHIIbeta+, IL1beta+, TNFalpha+) were activated in coho salmon skin during L. salmonis infection. Locally elevated expression of several pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. IL1beta, IL8, TNFalpha, COX2, C/EBPbeta), and tissue repair enzymes (MMP9, MMP13) were detected in susceptible and resistant species. However, responses specific to coho salmon (e.g. IL4, IL6, TGFbeta) or responses shared among susceptible salmon (e.g. SAP, TRF, Cath in Atlantic and sockeye salmon) provide evidence for species-specific pathways contributing to resistance or susceptibility, respectively. Our results confirm the importance of an early pro-inflammatory TH1-type pathway as an initial host response during infection with Pacific sea lice, and demonstrate subsequent regulatory TH2-type processes as candidate defense mechanisms in the skin of resistant coho salmon.","Dev Comp Immunol",-1

However, the mechanisms underlying this ability of cathepsins are still poorly understood. One excellent model for identifying and exploring the molecular functions of cathepsins is the marine ectoparasitic copepod Caligus rogercresseyi that currently affects the Chilean salmon industry. Using high-throughput transcriptome sequencing, 56 cathepsin-like sequences were found distributed in five cysteine protease groups (B, F, L, Z, and S) as well as in an aspartic protease group (D). Ontogenic transcriptome analysis evidenced that L cathepsins were the most abundant during the lifecycle, while cathepsins B and K were mostly expressed in the larval stages and adult females, thus suggesting participation in the molting processes and embryonic development, respectively. Interestingly, a variety of cathepsins from groups Z, L, D, B, K, and S were upregulated in the infective stage of copepodid, corroborating the complexity of the processes involved in the parasitic success of this copepod. Putative functional roles of cathepsins were conjectured based on the differential expressions found and on roles previously described in other phylogenetically related species. Moreover, 140 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified in transcripts annotated for cysteine and aspartic proteases located into untranslated regions, or the coding region. This study reports for the first time the presence of cathepsin-like genes and differential expressions throughout a copepod lifecycle. The identification of cathepsins together with functional validations represents a valuable strategy for pinpointing target molecules that could be used in the development of new delousing drugs or vaccines against C. rogercresseyi.","PLoS One",-1

Phaeobacter inhibens, which produces an antibacterial compound, tropodithietic acid (TDA), inhibited V. vulnificus as did pure TDA (MIC of 1-3.9 muM). P. inhibens DSM 17395 (at 10(6) cfu/ml) eradicated 10(5) cfu/ml V. vulnificus CMCP6 (a rifampicin resistant variant) from a co-culture oyster model system (oyster juice) whereas the pathogen grew to 10(7) cfu/ml when co-cultured with a TDA negative Phaeobacter mutant. P. inhibens grew well in oyster juice to 10(8) CFU/ml and sterile filtered samples from these cultures were inhibitory to Vibrio spp. P. inhibens established itself in live European flat oysters (Ostrea edulis) and remained at 10(5) cfu/g for five days. However, the presence of P. inhibens could not prevent subsequently added V. vulnificus from entering the live animals, likely because of too low levels of the biocontrol strain.

These halophilic bacteria are frequently found in marine and estuarine systems, accumulating within the tissues of a number of aquatic organisms and passing on to humans after consumption, through contaminated water, or via open wounds. As benthic organisms capable of filtering 40 gallons of water per hour, sediment is an important source of potentially pathogenic vibrios in oysters destined for raw consumption. This research used off-bottom oyster culture to reduce vibrio concentrations in oysters. Colony hybridization was used to enumerate Vp and Vv in bottom and suspended oysters. Vv and Vp concentrations were generally lower in oysters suspended off-bottom, and suspension decreased vibrio loads in oysters by an average of 13%. Suspension of oysters reduced vibrio concentrations. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study found that oyster suspension significantly reduced some populations of potentially pathogenic vibrios. These results indicate that oyster suspension could be a viable approach for preharvest treatment to reduce illness in consumers of raw oysters.","Lett Appl Microbiol",-1

In support of a study on pyrethroid impacts to Chinook salmon and steelhead trout in the American River (Sacramento, California, USA), 96-h median effective concentration (EC50) and median lethal concentration (LC50) values for the pyrethroid bifenthrin were determined for taxa not traditionally used for toxicity testing but of interest as salmonid prey, including a chironomid, caddisflies, mayflies, and stoneflies. A laboratory was constructed on the banks of the American River to expose macroinvertebrates, Chinook salmon, and steelhead trout to flow-through river water containing urban runoff during storm events. Bifenthrin from urban runoff was found in river water following 5 rain events, reaching 14.6 ng/L. Mortality to the exposed salmonids was not observed, and sublethal effects were not seen in vitellogenin or sex steroid levels. Indirect effects via toxicity to salmonid prey are possible. Mortality to Hyalella azteca, a potential prey, was observed in every event tested, and peak bifenthrin concentrations were comparable to the 96-h EC50 of the caddisfly, Hydropsyche sp., the most important prey species on a biomass basis for American River Chinook salmon. The other invertebrates tested had EC50s exceeding bifenthrin concentrations seen in the American River, though could potentially be at risk at concentrations previously reported in smaller urban tributaries.

Glover","Thermal plasticity in farmed, wild and hybrid Atlantic salmon during early development: has domestication caused divergence in low temperature tolerance?","BACKGROUND: In the past three decades, millions of domesticated Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. have escaped from farms into the wild. Their offspring display reduced survival in the natural environment, which demonstrates that gene-flow is likely to have a negative effect on wild populations. However, inter-population differences in introgression of farmed salmon have been observed, and the underlying ecological mechanisms remain enigmatic. We hypothesised that domestication-driven divergence in tolerance to low temperatures during early development may contribute to lower survival of farmed salmon offspring in the wild, which in turn, may influence patterns of introgression among populations exposed to different temperature regimes. We reared the offspring of 35 families of wild, farmed and hybrid origin at three temperatures (3.9, 5.6 and 12 degrees C) from the onset of exogenous feeding and throughout their first summer. Thermal reaction norms for growth and survival were investigated along the gradient. RESULTS: The main results of this study, which is based upon the analysis of juvenile salmon from five wild strains, two farmed strains and two hybrid strains, can be summarised as; (i) salmon of all origins were able to successfully initiate feeding at all temperatures and similar survival reaction norms were detected in all strains across the temperature gradient; (ii) deviating growth reaction norms were detected between strains, although this result was most likely due to an overall lack of growth in the lower temperature treatments. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed no evidence of domesticated-driven divergence in low temperature tolerance in Atlantic salmon during early development. Although the potential interaction between low temperature and other river-specific factors cannot be excluded, our results indicate that the reduced survival of farmed offspring in the wild is not explained by farmed salmon displaying impaired abilities to initiate feeding at low temperatures. We therefore suggest that the observed inter-population patterns of introgression are not low-temperature driven and that other ecological or biological factors may explain why detection of farmed salmon in wild rivers is not synonymous with introgression. In general, our results support the literature indicating that phenotypic plasticity instead of thermal adaption has been selected for in Atlantic salmon.","BMC Evol Biol",-1

Such changes have the potential to affect their responsiveness to various environmental factors that impose stress. In this study we compared the stress responses in parr and post-smolt salmon following exposure to repeated chasing stress (RCS) for three weeks. At the end of this period, all fish were challenged with a novel stressor and sampled before (T0) and after 1h (T1). Parr had a higher growth rate than post-smolts. Plasma cortisol declined in the RCS groups within the first week suggesting a rapid habituation/desensitisation of the endocrine stress axis. As a result of the desensitised HPI axis, RCS groups showed a reduced cortisol response when exposed to the novel stressor. In preoptic area (POA) crf mRNA levels were higher in all post-smolt groups compared to parr. 11betahsd2 decreased by RCS and by the novel stressor in post-smolt controls (T1), whereas no effect of either stress was seen in parr. The grs were low in all groups except for parr controls. In pituitary, parr controls had higher levels of crf1r mRNA than the other parr and post-smolt groups, whilst pomcb was higher in post-smolt control groups. Overall, 11betahsd2 transcript abundance in parr was lower than post-smolt groups; after the novel stressor pomcs, grs and mr were up-regulated in parr control (T1).

To gain a global understanding of antiviral genes induced by type I IFNs in salmonids, we used RNA-seq to characterize the transcriptomic changes induced by type I IFN treatment and salmon alphavirus subtype 3 (SAV-3) infection in TO-cells, a macrophage/dendritic like cell-line derived from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L) head kidney leukocytes. RESULTS: More than 23 million reads generated by RNA-seq were de novo assembled into 58098 unigenes used to generate a total of 3149 and 23289 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from TO-cells exposed to type I IFN treatment and SAV-3 infection, respectively. Although the DEGs were classified into genes associated with biological processes, cellular components and molecular function based on gene ontology classification, transcriptomic changes reported here show upregulation of genes belonging to the canonical type I IFN signaling pathways together with a broad spectrum of antiviral genes that block virus replication in host cells. In addition, the transcriptome shows a profile of genes associated with apoptosis as well as genes that activate adaptive immunity. Further, our findings show that the profile of genes expressed by TO-cells is comparable to orthologous genes expressed by mammalian macrophages and dendritic cells in response to type I IFNs. Twenty DEGs randomly selected for qRT-PCR confirmed the validity of the transcriptomic changes detected by RNA-seq by showing that the genes upregulated by RNA-seq were also upregulated by qRT-PCR and that genes downregulated by RNA-seq were also downregulated by qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The de novo assembled transcriptome presented here provides a global description of genes induced by type I IFNs in TO-cells that could serve as a repository for future studies in fish cells. Transcriptome analysis shows that a large proportion of IFN genes expressed in this study are comparable to IFNs genes expressed in mammalia. In addition, the study shows that SAV-3 is a potent inducer of type I IFNs and that the responses it induces in TO-cells could serve as a model for studying IFN responses in salmonids.","BMC Genomics",-1

However, little is known about environmental factors controlling the outbreaks, and little can be done to prevent the outbreaks because they are generally considered to be unpredictable. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a mathematical model for predicting risks of oyster norovirus outbreaks using environmental predictors. METHODS: We developed a novel probability-based Artificial Neural Network model, called NORF model, using 21 years of environmental and norovirus outbreak data collected from Louisiana oyster harvesting areas along the Gulf of Mexico coast, USA. The NORF model involves six input variables that were selected through stepwise regression analysis and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found that the model-based probability of norovirus outbreaks was most sensitive to gage height (the depth of water in an oyster bed) and water temperature, followed by wind, rainfall, and salinity, respectively. The NORF model predicted all historical oyster norovirus outbreaks from 1994 through 2014. Specifically, norovirus outbreaks occurred when the NORF model probability estimate was > 0.6, whereas no outbreaks occurred when the estimated probability was < 0.5. Outbreaks may also occur when the estimated probability is 0.5-0.6. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings require further confirmation, but they suggest that oyster norovirus outbreaks may be predictable using the NORF model. The ability to predict oyster norovirus outbreaks at their onset may make it possible to prevent or at least reduce the risk of norovirus outbreaks by closing potentially affected oyster beds.

Previous studies indicate that the level of farmed Atlantic salmon introgression in native populations is population specific. However, few studies have explored the potential role of population diversity or river characteristics, such as temperature, on the consequences of hybridization. We compared freshwater growth of multiple families derived from two farmed, five wild and two F1 hybrid salmon populations at three contrasting temperatures (7 degrees C, 12 degrees C and 16 degrees C) in a common garden experiment. As expected, farmed salmon outgrew wild salmon at all temperatures, with hybrids displaying intermediate growth. However, differences in growth were population specific and some wild populations performed better than others relative to the hybrid and farmed populations at certain temperatures. Therefore, the competitive balance between farmed and wild salmon may depend both on the thermal profile of the river and on the genetic characteristics of the respective farmed and wild strains. While limited to F1 hybridization, this study shows the merits in adopting a more complex spatially resolved approach to risk management of local populations.","Evol Appl",-1

In the present study, the immune function of an integrin from the oyster Crassostrea gigas (designated CgIntegrin) was characterized to understand the regulatory mechanism of hemocyte phagocytosis toward different microbes. The full-length cDNA of CgIntegrin was 2571 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2397 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 799 amino acids. The mRNA transcripts of CgIntegrin were predominantly detected in hemocytes, gonad and adductor muscle, while lowly in hepatopancreas, mantle and gill. The mRNA expression level was up-regulated at 6 h post lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (p < 0.01), while no significant change was observed after peptidoglycan (PGN) stimulation. The oyster hemocytes with relative high CgIntegrin expression level exhibited different phagocytic abilities towards different microorganism and particles, such as Gram-positive bacteria Vibrio splendidus, Gram-negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and latex beads. Moreover, the phagocytic rate towards V. splendidus was significantly decreased after the blockade of CgIntegrin using the polyclonal antibody. The recombinant CgIntegrin (rCgIntegrin) displayed agglutinating activity towards V. splendidus but not S. aureus and Y. lipolytica. It also exhibited a higher binding affinity towards LPS (compared to rTrx group) in a dose-dependent manner with the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 5.53 x 10(-6) M. The results indicated that CgIntegrin served as a pattern recognition receptor with LPS binding activity, which could directly bind to V. splendidus and enhance the phagocytosis of oyster hemocytes.","Dev Comp Immunol",-1

In this study, two species of oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis and Crassostrea angulata were transplanted to three sites in the Jiulong Estuary over a two-month period. The time-series changes of various biomarkers were measured, coupled with simultaneous quantification of metal bioaccumulation (Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn). Cu and Zn accumulation increased linearly and reached up to 2% and 1.5% dry tissue weight by the end of exposure. Negative correlations between the tissue Cu or Zn accumulation and catalase or superoxide dismutase activities strongly indicated that Cu and Zn in 'colored' oysters induced the adjustments of oyster antioxidant systems. Metallothionein (MT) detoxification was insufficient for sequestering all the absorbed metals and its concentrations in the oysters were suppressed following an initial increase, primarily due to the high metal accumulation in the tissues. Interestingly, gradual recoveries of lysosomal membrane stability after the initial strong inhibitions were observed in both oysters. We also documented an increasing 'watering' of oyster tissues presumably as a result of rupturing of tissue cells under metal stress. This study demonstrated the complexity of biomarker responses under field condition, therefore the time changes of biomarker responses to metals need to be considered in evaluating the biological impacts of metal pollution on estuarine organisms.","Sci Total Environ",-1

Thus, phosphorus speciation in a sediment core dated between 1945 and 2010 at cm-resolution and in surface sediments from Sancha reservoir may allow us track how fish farming impacts phosphorus dynamics in lake sediments. Fish farming shifts the major binding forms of phosphorus in sediments from organic to residual phosphorus, which mostly originated from fish feed. Sorption to metal oxides and association with organic matters are important mechanisms for phosphorus immobilisation with low fish farming activities, whereas calcium-bound phosphorous had an essential contribution to sediment phosphorus increases under intensive fish framing. Notwithstanding the shifting, the aforementioned phosphorus fractions are usually inert in the lake environment, therefore changing phosphorus mobility little. The use of fish feed and water-purification reagents, the most important additives for fish farming, introduce not only phosphorus but also large amounts of sand-sized minerals such as quartz into the lake, to which phosphorus weakly sorbs. The sand-sized minerals as additional sorbents increase the pool of easily mobilisable phosphorus in sediments, which will slow down the recovery of reservoir water due to its rapid re-mobilisation.","Sci Rep",-1

In this study, the dynamics of an infection of G. salaris on individually marked Atlantic salmon parr was followed in a section of a natural stream. During the 6-week experiment, the prevalence increased from 3.3 to 60.0%, with an average increase in intensity of 4.1% day(-1) . Survival analyses showed an initially high probability (93.6%) of staying uninfected by G. salaris, decreasing significantly to 37% after 6 weeks. The results showed that even at subarctic water temperatures and with an initially low risk of infection, the parasite spread rapidly in the Atlantic salmon population, with the capacity to reach 100% prevalence within a short summer season.

DNA vaccines are highly effective against salmonid rhabdoviruses, but have shown less effect against other viruses. In the present work we have studied if type I IFNs might be used as adjuvants in fish DNA vaccines. For this purpose we chose a DNA vaccine model based on the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) as antigen. Salmon presmolts were injected with a plasmid encoding HE alone or together with a plasmid encoding Atlantic salmon type I IFN (IFNa1, IFNb or IFNc). Sera were harvested after 7-10 weeks for measurements of antibody against ISAV and the fish were challenged with ISAV to measure protective effects of the vaccines. The results showed that all three IFN plasmids delivered together with HE plasmid potently enhanced protection of salmon against ISAV mediated mortality and stimulated an increase in IgM antibodies against the virus. In contrast, HE plasmid alone gave low antibody titers and a minor protection against ISAV. This demonstrates that type I IFNs stimulate adaptive immune responses in fish, which may be a benefit also in other fish DNA vaccines. Quantitative RT-PCR studies showed that the salmon IFNs caused an increased influx of B-cells and cytotoxic T-cells at the muscle injection site, which may in part explain the adjuvant effect of the IFNs.","Vaccine",-1

Galloway","Ingestion of Nanoplastics and Microplastics by Pacific Oyster Larvae","Plastic debris is a prolific contaminant effecting freshwater and marine ecosystems across the globe. Of growing environmental concern are ""microplastics""and ""nanoplastics"" encompassing tiny particles of plastic derived from manufacturing and macroplastic fragmentation. Pelagic zooplankton are susceptible to consuming microplastics, however the threat posed to larvae of commercially important bivalves is currently unknown. We exposed Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae (3-24 d.p.f.) to polystyrene particles spanning 70 nm-20 mum in size, including plastics with differing surface properties, and tested the impact of microplastics on larval feeding and growth. The frequency and magnitude of plastic ingestion over 24 h varied by larval age and size of polystyrene particle (ANOVA, P < 0.01), and surface properties of the plastic, with aminated particles ingested and retained more frequently (ANOVA, P < 0.01). A strong, significant correlation between propensity for plastic consumption and plastic load per organism was identified (Spearmans, r = 0.95, P < 0.01). Exposure to 1 and 10 mum PS for up to 8 days had no significant effect on C. gigas feeding or growth at <100 microplastics mL(-1). In conclusion, whil micro- and nanoplastics were readily ingested by oyster larvae, exposure to plastic concentrations exceeding those observed in the marine environment resulted in no measurable effects on the development or feeding capacity of the larvae over the duration of the study.","Environ Sci Technol",1

This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water as a pretreatment method during the process of cold-smoked salmon to inactivate L. monocytogenes. In addition, the effect of EO water treatment on the sensory and textural quality of the final product was also evaluated. Raw Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fillets were inoculated with L. monocytogenes (with an approximately cell number of 6 * 105 CFU/g L. monocytogenes ATCC 19114) and treated with EO water at three different temperatures (20, 30, and 40 ÁC) and at three different exposure time of 2, 6, and 10 min before the cold-smoking process. A combination of EO water and a mild temperature (40 ÁC) had reduced L monocytogenes populations by 2.85 log10 CFU/g. The sensory as evaluated by a consumer panel (N = 71) and texture, which was measured by texture analysis showed no significant changes between EO and mild temperature treated samples and the control.

Morphologically, all stages in the life cycle of L. salmonis have been described in detail based on successive samples from host populations. However, the rate of development differs between males and females as well as between individuals. It has therefore been difficult to observe development within stages, and this has led to a longstanding misinterpretation of the number of chalimus stages. Here samples of chalimi obtained for 12 consecutive days were observed daily in incubators. Chalimus 1 was able to molt in incubators only when fully grown and close to molting, whereas chalimus 2 was able to molt at about 60% of total instar growth. Total length instar growth was about 35% in both chalimus 1 and chalimus 2 and about equal among males and females; the cephalothorax increased by about 12% and the posterior body by about 80%. Instar growth was probably the main factor that led to the former belief that L. salmonis had four chalimus stages. Relative total length increase at molting was at the same order of magnitude as instar growth, but total length of females increased significantly more than that of males at molting. Consequently, a sexual size dimorphism was established upon molting to chalimus 2 and males were about 10% smaller than females. While growth by molting was mainly caused by cephalothorax increase, instar growth was mainly due to increase of the posterior body. The cephalothorax/total length ratio decreased from beginning to end of the instar phase suggesting that it may be used as an instar age marker. Male and female chalimus 2 can almost uniquely be identified by cephalothorax length. Chalimus 1 lasted between 5 and 6 days for males and between 6 and 7 days for females at 10 degrees C. Chalimus 2 males lasted between 6 and 7 days and females between 7 and 8 days.","Parasitol Int",-1

Gomez-Chiarri","Multi-species protein similarity clustering reveals novel expanded immune gene families in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica","Comparative genomics research in non-model species has highlighted how invertebrate hosts possess complex diversified repertoires of immune molecules. The levels of diversification in particular immune gene families appear to differ between invertebrate lineages and even between species within lineages, reflecting differences not only in evolutionary histories, but also in life histories, environmental niches, and pathogen exposures. The goal of this research was to identify immune-related gene families experiencing high levels of diversification in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica. Families containing 1) transcripts differentially expressed in eastern oysters in response to bacterial challenge and 2) a larger number of transcripts compared to other species included those coding for the C1q and C-type lectin domain containing proteins (C1qDC and CTLDC), GTPase of the immune-associated proteins (GIMAP), scavenger receptors (SR), fibrinogen-C domain containing proteins (also known as FREPs), dopamine beta-hydrolase (DBH), interferon-inducible 44 (IFI44), serine protease inhibitors, apextrin, and dermatopontin. Phylogenetic analysis of two of the families significantly expanded in bivalves, IFI44 and GIMAP, showed a patchy distribution within both protostomes and deuterostomes, suggesting multiple independent losses and lineage-specific expansions. Increased availability of genomic information for a broader range of non-model species broadly distributed through vertebrate and invertebrate phyla will likely lead to improved knowledge on mechanisms of immune-gene diversification.","Fish Shellfish Immunol",-1

We evaluated the distribution, the effect of environmental parameters, the pheno-genotypic profile and the growth characteristics of strains isolated from shellfish. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vibrio vulnificus was present in 13.6% of Pacific oysters and not found in any dredge oyster or Greenshell() mussel samples. Eleven isolates belonged to biotype 1 while nine appeared to be variants of biotype 1. Nineteen isolates were genotype E (type A) and just one was genotype C (type B). Some isolates were more resistant to high salt concentrations (>30 per thousand) than others, but not different from ATCC 27562. CONCLUSIONS: Vibrio vulnificus were low in numbers, mostly belonging to genotype E, 16S rRNA type A and biotype 1. No relationship or adaptability to high salinity was observed, but seawater temperature was a strong predictor of bacterial numbers in shellfish. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We report, for the first time, the characterization of V. vulnificus isolated from New Zealand shellfish and its long-term distribution and prevalence.

Toxin accumulation in oysters was proposed to be influenced by the proportion of energy allocated to reproduction versus other metabolisms, as proposed by Haberkorn et al. (2010). Thus, we hypothesized that triploid oysters with different gametogenesis patterns (alpha or beta, producing respectively numerous gametes or rare gametes) could result in differences in toxin accumulation. Toxin level could also be different according to the gender of the oysters. To test these hypotheses, PST levels were measured in the digestive gland of oysters using an ELISA method. Sex, gametogenesis stage and pattern (alpha or beta) of the triploid oysters were determined by histology. Males (24%), females (38%) and hermaphrodites (38%), including synchronous or successive hermaphrodites were represented among the sampled oysters. All of them were at mature stage (III) of gametogenesis. Both alpha (46%) and beta (54%) patterns were represented in the sample set. In these oysters, PST levels appeared independent from sex and gametogenesis pattern. These results suggest that, in triploid oysters, PST accumulation is not influenced by energy allocated to reproduction. Statement of relevance This study appears to be the first to investigate toxin levels depending on gametogenesis pattern in triploid oysters. This study highlighted that triploid oysters were divided into two classes, alpha (triploid oysters that maturate with unlocked germ cells and have a consequent number of gametes) and beta (triploid oysters that display strongly reduced number of gametes and locked gonial mitosis), with the latter class subdivided into two categories: beta1, which presents no germinal cell lineage, and beta2, which presents germinal cell lineage. This study showed that toxin levels in the digestive glands of triploids were not significantly different, neither between gametogenesis patterns nor between sexes. Additionally, despite the different patterns of gametogenesis in the triploid oysters of the present study, no difference in toxin levels accumulated in the digestive glands was detected between alpha and beta oysters, suggesting that reproductive investment in triploid oysters does not influence toxin accumulation.

Dempster","Gone with the flow: current velocities mediate parasitic infestation of an aquatic host","Host-parasite interactions are moderated by the environmental conditions of the interaction medium (e.g. air or water). Encounter rate and the time available for a parasite to make physical contact with a host are both influenced by fluid dynamics, yet how they interact is poorly known. Here, we tested whether current velocities altered the initial attachment and post-settlement survival of an ecto-parasitic copepod (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) on Atlantic salmon. Current velocities strongly influenced attachment; infestation levels were 2.5 and 1.3 times higher in moderate than high and low velocity currents, respectively, while current velocities did not affect post-settlement survival. An interplay between a reduced host-parasite encounter rate in a low velocity current and reduced contact time in a high velocity current likely explains this result. Initial parasite attachment position was influenced by an interaction between current velocity and swimming behaviour, likely due to different fin positioning by fish in flows of different velocities. Our results imply that rapid swimming by salmon migrating out of coastal waters, usually described as adaptive against predation, could also be adaptive against parasitism. Infestation rates were also highest at the typical swimming speed of farmed salmon in coastal fish farms, which may be a hitherto unrecognised factor contributing to L. salmonis epidemics.","Int J Parasitol",-1

Many types of seafood are rich in cadmium, but bioavailability and potential for toxicity after consumption is less clear. This study investigates the relationship between seafood intake and the level of cadmium (Cd) in the blood in a 252 person cohort of avid seafood consumers in the Long Island Study of Seafood Consumption (New York). Blood cadmium is an established biomarker of cadmium exposure, reflecting both recent and decade-long exposure. Data on the amounts and frequency of eating various types of seafood were self-reported by avid seafood consumers recruited in 2011-2012. After adjusting for age, BMI, sex, current smoking status, and income in a linear regression model, we found no association between regular seafood intake (beta=-0.01; p=0.11) but did identify an association between salmon intake in cups/week (ln transformed) (beta=0.20; p=0.001) and blood cadmium. After accounting for salmon, no other types of seafood were meaningfully associated with blood cadmium. No association was found between rice intake, blood zinc, or dietary iron or calcium and blood cadmium. Results suggest that seafood is not a major source of cadmium exposure, but that salmon intake does marginally increase blood cadmium levels. Given that cadmium levels in salmon are not higher than those in many other seafood species, the association with salmon intake is likely attributed to higher consumption of salmon in this population.","Int J Hyg Environ Health",-1

To optimize the Maillard reaction conditions for oyster enzymatic hydrolysates and reducing sugar based on sensory evaluation of Maillard reaction products (MRPs). Methods. The optimization was carried out using response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken experimental design. Electronic nose and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were employed to analyze the volatile flavor compounds of fresh oyster (FO), oyster enzymatic hydrolysates (OEH), optimal Maillard reaction products from oyster enzymatic hydrolysates and reducing sugar (OMRPs-OEH). Results. The optimal reaction conditions were found as follows: extraction time, 29.43 min; temperature, 114.62 ÁC; pH, 6.97; and ratio of enzymatic hydrolysates to reducing sugar (glucose:xylose = 1:2), 1:1. Under these conditions, the experimental value of sensory evaluation score was 20.88, compared to the predicted value of 20.25. The relative error between the experimental and predicted values was 3.08%. A total of 30, 36 and 45 components were identified from FO, OEH and OMRPs-OEH by GC-MS, respectively. The main volatile compounds of OEH were octanal, nonanal, decanal and (Z)-2-decenal, which were responsible for the unpleasant smells such as fishy, rancid, and oily. After the Maillard reaction, dimethyl disulfide, trimethyl disulfide and (Z)-4-heptenal became the main volatile compounds, which contributed to the shellfish, meat and seafood flavors. Meanwhile, pyrazine substances were formed, which were responsible for some nuts-meat flavors. Conclusions. The Maillard reaction not only can improve fishy odor of OEH, but also can develop a new oyster flavoring agent, which has highly economic and social value.","Food Science, China",1

Here, we report the results of a comprehensive screen for EVEs in crustaceans. Following up on the recent discovery of EVEs in the terrestrial isopod, Armadillidium vulgare, we scanned the genomes of six crustacean species: a terrestrial isopod (Armadillidium nasatum), two water fleas (Daphnia pulex and D. pulicaria), two copepods (the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Eurytemora affinis), and a freshwater amphipod (Hyalella azteca). RESULTS: In total, we found 210 EVEs representing 14 different lineages belonging to five different viral groups that are present in two to five species: Bunyaviridae (-ssRNA), Circoviridae (ssDNA), Mononegavirales (-ssRNA), Parvoviridae (ssDNA) and Totiviridae (dsRNA). The identification of shared orthologous insertions between A. nasatum and A. vulgare indicates that EVEs have been maintained over several millions of years, although we did not find any evidence supporting exaptation. Overall, the different degrees of EVE degradation (from none to >10 nonsense mutations) suggest that endogenization has been recurrent during the evolution of the various crustacean taxa. Our study is the first to report EVEs in D. pulicaria, E. affinis and H. azteca, many of which are likely to result from recent endogenization of currently circulating viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we have unearthed a large diversity of EVEs from crustacean genomes, and shown that four of the five viral groups we uncovered (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae) were and may still be present in three to four highly divergent crustacean taxa. In addition, the discovery of recent EVEs offers an interesting opportunity to characterize new exogenous viruses currently circulating in economically or ecologically important copepod species.","Mob DNA",-1

Use of semipermeable packaging films has been advocated; however, previous studies are inconclusive in determining the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of a film that is needed to achieve an acceptable margin of safety (i.e., toxin production occurs only after spoilage). This study was conducted to determine the influence of OTR (target OTRs of 3 to 15,000) on the development of spoilage volatiles and toxin in salmon inoculated with type E Clostridium botulinum and subjected to air, vacuum, or 75:25 CO2:N2 MA and storage temperatures of 4, 8, 12, or 16 degrees C. The most dominant headspace volatile peak that was produced during spoilage of samples at 4, 8 or 12 degrees C was a peak, having a Kovats retention index (KI) of 753, and at which external standards of 2- or 3-methyl 1-butanol also eluted. Under anaerobic conditions, both the aerobic microbial populations and the size of the KI 753 spoilage peak were less in inoculated samples compared with uninoculated samples. C. botulinum-inoculated samples that were stored at 12 or 16 degrees C under conditions favorable for anaerobic growth were also characterized by a KI 688 peak. Using a previously developed model that related the percentage of elderly consumers who would prepare a sample having the KI 753 spoilage peak of a specific size, it was determined that for salmon packaged with 3 or 3,000 OTR films under any atmosphere and stored at 12 or 16 degrees C, 2 to 61% of the consumers could potentially prepare toxin-contaminated samples. Hence, when abusive storage conditions are suspected, the fish should not be consumed.","J Food Prot",-1

By applying genomewide analysis using two molecular marker types (1986 SNPs and 17 microsatellites), we assessed the genetic impacts of inadvertent gene flow via straying from hatchery releases on wild populations of Atlantic salmon in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea, over 16 years (1996-2012). Both microsatellites and SNPs revealed congruent population genetic structuring, indicating that introgression changed the genetic make-up of wild populations by increasing genetic diversity and reducing genetic divergence. However, the degree of genetic introgression varied among studied populations, being higher in the eastern part and lower in the western part of Estonia, which most likely reflects the history of past stocking activities. Using kernel smoothing and permutation testing, we detected considerable heterogeneity in introgression patterns across the genome, with a large number of regions exhibiting nonrandom introgression widely dispersed across the genome. We also observed substantial variation in nonrandom introgression patterns within populations, as the majority of genomic regions showing elevated or reduced introgression were not consistently detected among temporal samples. This suggests that recombination, selection and stochastic processes may contribute to complex nonrandom introgression patterns. Our results suggest that (i) some genomic regions in Atlantic salmon are more vulnerable to introgressive hybridization, while others show greater resistance to unidirectional gene flow; and (ii) the hybridization of previously separated populations leads to complex and dynamic nonrandom introgression patterns that most likely have functional consequences for indigenous populations.","Mol Ecol",-1

The most frequent method of controlling these sea louse infestations is through the use of chemical treatments. However, most major salmon farming areas have observed resistance to common chemotherapeutants. In terrestrial environments, many strategies employed to manage the evolution of resistance involve the use of refugia, where a portion of the population is left untreated to maintain susceptibility. While refugia have not been deliberately used in Atlantic salmon farming, wild salmon populations that migrate close to salmon farms may act as natural refugia. In this paper we describe an agent-based model that explores the influence of different sizes of wild salmon populations on resistance evolution in sea lice on a salmon farm. Using the model, we demonstrate that wild salmon populations can act as refugia that limit the evolution of resistance in the sea louse populations. Additionally, we demonstrate that an increase in the size of the population of wild salmon results in an increased effect in slowing the evolution of resistance. We explore the effect of a population fitness cost associated with resistance, finding that in some cases it substantially reduces the speed of evolution to chemical treatments.","PLoS One",-1

Its effects on lipid and cholesterol oxidation of farmed Atlantic salmon fillets were evaluated at two times of refrigerated (2.5 degrees C) storage, T0 (64 h after death) and T14 (14 days from T0). The use of CO was compared with the commonly utilized percussion (P) method. RESULTS: Fatty acid profile, primary (conjugated dienes) and secondary (TBARS) oxidation products, cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) and carotenoids were unaffected by the killing method. Despite the low oxidative status of lipid (0.66 and 0.60 mg malondialdehyde kg(-1) muscle in P and CO fish respectively), cholesterol was found to be highly oxidized (0.17 and 0.13 mg COPs kg(-1) ). Storage significantly affected oxidative stability of fish muscle by increasing oxidation products. Interestingly, TBARS content doubled while the increase for COPs was not homogeneous: alpha- and beta-epoxycholesterol increased by 25%, whereas triol and 7-ketocholesterol increased by 48 and 62% respectively. CONCLUSION: The quality of salmon fillets just after slaughtering and after 14 days of refrigerated storage at 2.5 degrees C did not change, irrespective of the killing method adopted, suggesting that the CO method may be applied without any detrimental effect on the quality of fish fillets.

Projecting the fate of fish populations using ecological-economic modeling","Four marine fish species are among the most important on the world market: cod, salmon, tuna, and sea bass. While the supply of North American and European markets for two of these species - Atlantic salmon and European sea bass - mainly comes from fish farming, Atlantic cod and tunas are mainly caught from wild stocks. We address the question what will be the status of these wild stocks in the midterm future, in the year 2048, to be specific. Whereas the effects of climate change and ecological driving forces on fish stocks have already gained much attention, our prime interest is in studying the effects of changing economic drivers, as well as the impact of variable management effectiveness. Using a process-based ecological-economic multispecies optimization model, we assess the future stock status under different scenarios of change. We simulate (i) technological progress in fishing, (ii) increasing demand for fish, and (iii) increasing supply of farmed fish, as well as the interplay of these driving forces under different scenarios of (limited) fishery management effectiveness. We find that economic change has a substantial effect on fish populations. Increasing aquaculture production can dampen the fishing pressure on wild stocks, but this effect is likely to be overwhelmed by increasing demand and technological progress, both increasing fishing pressure. The only solution to avoid collapse of the majority of stocks is institutional change to improve management effectiveness significantly above the current state. We conclude that full recognition of economic drivers of change will be needed to successfully develop an integrated ecosystem management and to sustain the wild fish stocks until 2048 and beyond.","Glob Chang Biol",-1

The aim of this work was to study to which degree Lilaflot D817M, a flotation chemical extensively used by the mining industry, represents a hazard for migrating salmon in rivers affected by mining activity. Smoltifying Atlantic salmon were exposed to four concentrations of iron-ore mine tailings containing residual Lilaflot D817M [water versus tailing volumes of 0.002 (Low), 0.004 (Medium), 0.013 (High) and 0.04 (Max)]. After 96 h of exposure, gill and liver tissues were harvested for transcriptional responses. Target genes included markers for oxidative stress, detoxification, apoptosis and DNA repair, cell signaling and growth. RESULTS: Of the 16 evaluated markers, significant transcriptional responses of exposure to tailings enriched with Lilaflot D817M were observed for CYP1A, HSP70 and HMOX1 in liver tissue and CYP1A in gill tissue. The significant induction of CYP1A in both liver and gills suggest that the flotation chemical is taken up by the fish and activates cytochrome P450 detoxification via phase I biotransformation in the cells. CONCLUSIONS: The overall weak transcriptional responses to short-term exposure to Lilaflot D817M-containing iron-ore tailings suggest that the mining chemical has relatively low toxic effect on fish. The underlying mechanisms behind the observed CYP1A induction should be studied further.","BMC Res Notes",1

Oyster peptides and zinc sulfate were the raw materials, and chelating effect was determined by chelating ratio of zinc and the yield of the peptide-zinc chelates. The results revealed that oyster peptides were composed of 92.34 % peptides with a molecular size under 1000 u, and rich in glutamic acid and glutamine, aspartic acid and asparagines. Moreover, the optimal condition of the chelating reaction was as follow: the mass ratio of peptides to ZnSO4 was 20:1, the concentration of peptides was 0.06 g/mL, the reaction temperature was 50 ÁC, the dosage of precipitating agent (ethanol) was 5 times as much as reaction liquid, the pH value was 5.33, and the reaction time was 60 min. Under the optimal chelating conditions, the chelated zinc ratio reached 89.55% 0.23%, and the productive index of the peptide-zinc chelates was 56.64% 0.55%.","Science and Technology of Food Industry",-1

In this work, mercury (Hg2+) toxicity was studied in cells obtained from Atlantic salmon smolt kept at 15 degrees C (optimal growth temperature) for 3 months or at a stepwise increase to 20 degrees C (temperature-stress) during 3 months prior to cell harvest to evaluate whether acclimation temperature affects Hg toxicity. To examine possible altered dietary requirements in warmer seas, one group of fish following the stepwise temperature regimes was fed a diet spiked with antioxidants. Atlantic salmon hepatocytes were exposed in vitro to 0, 1.0, or 100 muM Hg2+ for 48 h. Cytotoxicity, determined as electrical impedance changes with the xCELLigence system, and transcriptional responses, determined with RT-qPCR, were assessed as measures of toxicity. The results showed that inorganic Hg at a concentration up to 100 muM is not cytotoxic to Atlantic salmon hepatocytes. Significance and directional responses of the 18 evaluated target genes suggest that both Hg and temperature stress affected the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in the protection against ROS-generated oxidative stress. Both stressors also affected the transcription of genes linked to lipid metabolism. Spiking the diet with antioxidants resulted in higher concentrations of Se and vitamin C and reduced concentration of Hg in the liver in vivo, but no interactions were seen between the dietary supplementation of antioxidants and Hg toxicity in vitro. In conclusion, no evidence was found suggesting that inorganic Hg is more toxic in cells harvested from temperature-stressed fish.","Biol Trace Elem Res",-1

It is thus puzzling how oysters detoxify the excessively accumulated metals. Here, we used X-ray absorption spectroscopy to examine the Cu and Zn speciation in two ""colored"" oysters (Crassostrea hongkongensis and Crassostrea sikamea) collected from a severely metal-contaminated estuary. In contaminated oysters, we found a much higher proportion of tissue Cu and Zn as oxygen- or nitrogen-bonded species, contrasting to the sulfur-bonded (thiolate) species in normal oysters. Speciation of Cu and Zn in mantle was similar to that in gills, both of which were different from that in the digestive gland. In C. sikamea, the difference of metal speciation between normal and contaminated individuals was of similar pattern but less pronounced than that in C. hongkongensis. In normal oysters, Cu existed mainly as Cu(I) bound to sulfur, whereas in contaminated oysters mainly as Cu(II) bound to oxygen or nitrogen. Our study provided direct and semiquantitative information on the changes of metal speciation in contaminated oysters, indicating that oysters could efficiently detoxify the excessively accumulated Cu and Zn by storing them in oxygen- and nitrogen-bonded complexes in metal-rich environments.","Environ Sci Technol",-1

Renault","In vivo effects of metaldehyde on Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas: comparing hemocyte parameters in two oyster families","Pollutants via run-off into the ocean represent a potential threat to marine organisms, especially bivalves such as oysters living in coastal environments. These organisms filter large volumes of seawater and may accumulate contaminants within their tissues. Pesticide contamination in water could have a direct or indirect toxic action on tissues or cells and could induce alteration of immune system. Bivalve immunity is mainly supported by hemocytes and participates directly by phagocytosis to eliminate pathogens. Some studies have shown that pesticides can reduce immune defences and/or modify genomes in vertebrates and invertebrates. Metaldehyde is used to kill slugs, snails and other terrestrial gastropods. Although metaldehyde has been detected in surface waters, its effects on marine bivalves including the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, have never been studied. Given the mode of action of this molecule and its targets (molluscs), it could be potentially more toxic to oysters than other pesticides (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, etc.). Effects of metaldehyde on oyster hemocyte parameters were thus monitored through in vivo experiments based on a short-term exposure. In this work, metaldehyde at 0.1 mug/L, which corresponds to an average concentration detected in the environment, modulated hemocyte activities of Pacific oysters after an in vivo short-term contact. Individuals belonging to two families showed different behaviours for some hemocyte activities after contamination by metaldehyde. These results suggested that effects of pollutants on oysters may differ from an individual to another in relation to genetic diversity. Finally, it appears essential to take an interest in the effects of metaldehyde on a wide variety of aquatic invertebrates including those that have a significant economic impact.","Environ Sci Pollut Res Int",-1

This study evaluated the influence of water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a, pH, and turbidity on the seasonal density of Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 ompW and pathogenic ctxA and chxA in Mandinga Lagoon American oysters (Crassostrea virginica). V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 ompW+ and chxA+ prevalences were significantly high in summer (7.0%) and during the winter season (4.5%) and all ompW + isolates were confirmed chxA+. The highest mean V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 ompW+/chxA+ densities were observed during summer (11.53/2.29 MPN/g bank A) and fall (97.76/5.19MPN/g bank B) than those detected in other seasons. Cholera toxin ctxA was not detected throughout the study period. V. cholerae non-O1/non O139 ompW+ density was related to the influence of temperature - chlorophyll a and to salinity - chlorophyll a (R2= 0.505, P = 0.015), and V. cholerae non-O1/non O139 chxA+ density was related to the influence of temperature - turbidity and to salinity - chlorophyll a (R2= 0.400, P = 0.021). As the ChxA toxin is a lately discovered virulence factor that induces pathogenicity in humans, our findings provide a perspective regarding the environmental conditions regulating the dynamic of pathogenic V. cholerae non-O1/no-O139 chxA+ occurrence in tropical regions and its significance in the preventive measures required to enhance the safety of raw oysters in order to protect consumer health.

In nearshore tidal waters, an elevational gradient in aerial exposure during low tide can shape the spatial distributions of benthic marine organisms. The eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica is an ecologically and economically important species that can dominate both subtidal and intertidal habitats along the east coast of the USA. Our goal was to determine whether prevalence and intensity of Perkinsus marinus (the causative agent of Dermo disease) infections vary along intertidal to subtidal gradients during summer. We used (1) field experiments conducted at 4 sites in the Chesapeake Bay and a Virginia coastal bay, (2) a controlled air-exposure experiment, and (3) field surveys from 7 sites ranging from Maine to North Carolina to test for effects of tidal exposure on infection. Results from our field surveys suggested that high intertidal oysters tend to have higher infection prevalence than subtidal oysters, but there was no effect on infection intensity. Field experiments rarely yielded significant effects of tidal exposure on infection prevalence and intensity. Overall, our study shows that exposure to air may not be a strong driver of infection patterns in this host-parasite system.","Dis Aquat Organ",-1

An efficient and rapid virus detection method is required for routine monitoring and risk assessment in food products. A duplex RT-coupled nested PCR method was developed to detect the simultaneous presence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and rotavirus in commercial oysters from the eastern coast of Thailand. Primers were designed to amplify HAV VP4 and rotavirus VP7 genes. Although excess amounts of target template of one virus type interfered with RT-PCR am- plification of the other, this was overcome by including a nested duplex PCR step. Detection limit for both types of virus of this technique in oyster samples was more than 1,000-fold lower than that of the equivalent monoplex method. Out of 41 oyster samples 63% were positive for either one or both viruses. All rotaviruses belonged to group A G1P[8]. The use of multiplex RT-coupled nested PCR technique provides a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive and efficient tool to detect a wide diversity of viral pathogens and to improve control of virus infection in oysters.","Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health",-1

Many wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salarL.) populations are threatened by anthropogenic influences, and they are supplemented with captively bred fish. The Atlantic salmon is also widely used in selective breeding programs to increase the mean trait values for desired phenotypic traits. We analyzed a genomewide set of SNPs in three domesticated Atlantic salmon strains and their wild conspecifics to identify loci underlying domestication. The genetic differentiation between domesticated strains and wild populations was low (F ST < 0.03), and domesticated strains harbored similar levels of genetic diversity compared to their wild conspecifics. Only a few loci showed footprints of selection, and these loci were located in different linkage groups among the different wild population/hatchery strain comparisons. Simulated scenarios indicated that differentiation in quantitative trait loci exceeded that in neutral markers during the early phases of divergence only when the difference in the phenotypic optimum between populations was large. This study indicates that detecting selection using standard approaches in the early phases of domestication might be challenging unless selection is strong and the traits under selection show simple inheritance patterns.","Evol Appl",-1

We characterized the time-series change of metal bioaccumulation and final metabolomics responses of oysters. Following transplantation, all metals (Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the oyster digestive glands had elevated concentrations over time. By the end of six-month exposure, Cu, Zn and Cd were the main metals significantly differentiating the two sites. Using (1)H NMR metabolite approach, we further demonstrated the disturbance in osmotic regulation, energy metabolism, and glycerophospholipid metabolism induced by metal contaminations. Six months later, the oysters transplanted in the two sites showed a similar metabolite variation pattern when compared with the initial oysters regardless of different metal levels in the tissues. Interestingly, by comparing the oysters from two sites, the more severely polluted oysters accumulated significantly higher amounts of osmolytes (betaine and homarine) and lower energy storage compounds (glycogen) than the less polluted oysters; these changes could be the potential biomarkers for different levels of metal pollution.

In the present study we have examined the protective and adverse effects of mineral oil-adjuvanted injection vaccines on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A commercial vaccine and an experimental auto vaccine, as well as their respective adjuvant formulations alone were used to evaluate their individual effects, both prior to and during an experimental waterborne infection challenge. Macro- and microscopic examination revealed signs of vaccine-induced adverse effects from 10 weeks to 14 months post vaccination. Both vaccines induced statistically significant protection during the experimental challenge (P=0.018 for both vaccines), as well as significantly elevated levels of specific circulating antibodies prior to and during the experimental challenge when compared to an unvaccinated control group. During the early, critical time points of the infection, both vaccines appeared to protect against pathological changes to the liver and spleen, which provides a probable explanation for the reduced mortality seen in the vaccinated groups. A significant correlation was found between the level of A. salmonicida-specific antibodies measured prior to challenge and the endpoint survival of each group after the experimental infection, and furthermore, the levels of these antibodies remained elevated for at least 14 months post vaccination.","Fish Shellfish Immunol",-1

In this work, cell-surface-related properties of the isolates responsible for outbreaks in Atlantic salmon were investigated. We also briefly examined whether pathogenicity against fish varied for V. ordalii strains with differing cell-surface properties. Hydrocarbon adhesions indicated the hydrophobic character of V. ordalii, although only 4 of 18 isolates induced haemagglutination in Atlantic salmon erythrocytes. A minority of the studied isolates (6 of 18) and the type strain ATCC 33509T produced low-grade biofilm formation on polyethylene surface after 2 h post-inoculation (hpi), but no strains were slime producers. Interestingly, V. ordalii isolates showed wide differences in hydrophobicity. Therefore, we chose 3 V. ordalii isolates (Vo-LM-03, Vo-LM-18 and Vo-LM-16) as representative of each hydrophobicity group (strongly hydrophobic, relatively hydrophobic and quasi-hydrophilic, respectively) and ATCC 33509T was used in the pathogenicity studies. All tested V. ordalii strains except the type strain resisted the killing activity of Atlantic salmon mucus and serum, and could proliferate in these components. Moreover, all V. ordalii isolates adhered to SHK-1 cells, causing damage to fish cell membrane permeability after 16 hpi. Virulence testing using rainbow trout revealed that isolate Vo-LM-18 was more virulent than isolates Vo-LM-03 and Vo-LM-16, indicating some relationship between haemagglutination and virulence, but not with hydrophobicity.","Dis Aquat Organ",-1

Recently, a transcript denoted peroxinectin-like was identified in the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis, and this was significantly correlated with the immune response of host fish. Thus, the PX gene is a potential candidate to evaluate host-parasite interactions, as well as to analyze responses to delousing drugs used in the salmon aquaculture industry worldwide. The objective of this study was to identify Peroxinectin transcripts in the Chilean salmon louse Caligus rogercresseyi, and to determine expression levels after exposition to the antiparasitics deltamethrin and azamethiphos. Two novel transcript homologs to peroxinectins were identified from a transcriptomic library of C. rogercresseyi. Moreover, in silico gene transcription levels were evaluated through RNA-seq analyses based on unique gene read levels in transcriptomic libraries that were constructed from sea lice exposed to delousing drugs. The identified transcripts were named Peroxinectin-Cr1 and Peroxinectin-Cr2, which, respectively, had lengths of 2543 and 2555 base pairs. Both PX transcripts were highly associated with male adults, and transcription levels were significantly reduced by deltamethrin and azamethiphos.

Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) forecasting models predict stock composition, abundance, and distribution during annual assessments of proposed fisheries impacts. Most models, however, fail to account for the influence of biophysical factors on year-to-year fluctuations in migratory distributions and stock-specific survival. In this study, the ocean distribution and relative abundance of Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) stocks encountered in the California Current large marine ecosystem, U.S.A were inferred using catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) fisheries and genetic stock identification data. In contrast to stock distributions estimated through coded-wire-tag recoveries (typically limited to hatchery salmon), stock-specific CPUE provides information for both wild and hatchery fish. Furthermore, in contrast to stock composition results, the stock-specific CPUE metric is independent of other stocks and is easily interpreted over multiple temporal or spatial scales. Tests for correlations between stock-specific CPUE and stock composition estimates revealed these measures diverged once proportional contributions of locally rare stocks were excluded from data sets. A novel aspect of this study was collection of data both in areas closed to commercial fisheries and during normal, open commercial fisheries. Because fishing fleet efficiency influences catch rates, we tested whether CPUE differed between closed area (non-retention) and open area (retention) data sets. A weak effect was indicated for some, but not all, analyzed cases. Novel visualizations produced from stock-specific CPUE-based ocean abundance facilitates consideration of how highly refined, spatial and genetic information could be incorporated in ocean fisheries management systems and for investigations of biogeographic factors that influence migratory distributions of fish.","PLoS One",-1

PRV is associated with heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and cause intraerythrocytic inclusions.

In mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), the outer capsid protein o3 has dsRNA binding properties, which serve to inhibit the early innate immune response of the host. Important structural motifs and key amino acid residues are conserved between MRV o3 and the homologous PRV protein, and we hypothesized that PRV o3 binds dsRNA. Gene regions and amino acid residues predicted to be important for dsRNA binding were determined through bioinformatic analysis and investigated functionally following site-directed mutagenesis and the generation of truncated o3 variants. Our results provide evidence that the PRV protein o3 binds dsRNA in a sequence independent manner, thus sharing this function with MRV o3. Although no specific domain solely responsible for dsRNA binding was determined, the results point to residues within a predominantly basic region to be important for this functional property. We conclude that multiple sites are involved in the dsRNA binding activity of PRV o3.","Virus Res",-1

The result of this study shows that incidence of V. parahaemolyticus was more prevalent in oysters with overall prevalence rate of 63.4 % (95 % CI 0.592-0.674) than other seafood. Overall prevalence rate of clams was 52.9 % (95 % CI 0.490-0.568); fish 51.0 % (95 % CI 0.476-0.544); shrimps 48.3 % (95 % CI 0.454-0.512) and mussels, scallop and periwinkle: 28.0 % (95 % CI 0.255-0.307). High heterogeneity (p value <0.001; I (2) = 95.291) was observed mussel compared to oysters (I (2) = 91.024). It could be observed from this study that oysters harbor V. parahaemolyticus based on the prevalence rate than other seafood investigated. The occurrence and prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus is of public health importance, hence, more studies involving seafood such as mussels need to be investigated.","Springerplus",-1
"313","Y. Sapozhnikova and S. J. Lehotay","Evaluation of different parameters in the extraction of incurred pesticides and environmental contaminants in fish","Sample processing is often ignored during analytical method development and validation, but accurate results for real samples depend on all aspects of the analytical process. Also, validation is often conducted using only spiked samples, but extraction yields may be lower in incurred samples. In this study, different variables in extraction for incurred pesticides and environmental contaminants in fish were investigated. Among 207 analytes screened using low-pressure gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, consisting of 150 pesticides, 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 14 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 6 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and 22 other flame retardants (FRs), 35 (16 pesticides, 9 PCBs, 5 PBDEs, and 5 PAHs) were identified for quantification in samples of salmon, croaker, and NIST Standard Reference Material 1947 (Lake Michigan Fish Tissue). Extraction efficiencies using different extraction devices (blending, vortexing, and vibrating) versus time, sample size, and sample/solvent ratio were determined. In comparison to blending results, use of a pulsed-vortexer for 1 min with 1/1 (g/mL) sample/acetonitrile ratio was generally sufficient to extract the incurred contaminants in the homogenized fish tissues. Conversely, extraction with a prototype vibration shaker often took 60 min to achieve 100% extraction efficiency. A main conclusion from this study is that accurate results for real samples can be obtained using batch extraction with a pulsed-vortexer in a simple and efficient method that achieves high sample throughput.","J Agric Food Chem",1
"584","L. D. Coen and M. J. Bishop","The ecology, evolution, impacts and management of host-parasite interactions of marine molluscs","Molluscs are economically and ecologically important components of aquatic ecosystems. In addition to supporting valuable aquaculture and wild-harvest industries, their populations determine the structure of benthic communities, cycling of nutrients, serve as prey resources for higher trophic levels and, in some instances, stabilize shorelines and maintain water quality. This paper reviews existing knowledge of the ecology of host-parasite interactions involving marine molluscs, with a focus on gastropods and bivalves. It considers the ecological and evolutionary impacts of molluscan parasites on their hosts and vice versa, and on the communities and ecosystems in which they are a part, as well as disease management and its ecological impacts. An increasing number of case studies show that disease can have important effects on marine molluscs, their ecological interactions and ecosystem services, at spatial scales from centimeters to thousands of kilometers and timescales ranging from hours to years. In some instances the cascading indirect effects arising from parasitic infection of molluscs extend well beyond the temporal and spatial scales at which molluscs are affected by disease. In addition to the direct effects of molluscan disease, there can be large indirect impacts on marine environments resulting from strategies, such as introduction of non-native species and selective breeding for disease resistance, put in place to manage disease. Much of our understanding of impacts of molluscan diseases on the marine environment has been derived from just a handful of intensively studied marine parasite-host systems, namely gastropod-trematode, cockle-trematode, and oyster-protistan interactions. Understanding molluscan host-parasite dynamics is of growing importance because: (1) expanding aquaculture; (2) current and future climate change; (3) movement of non-native species; and (4) coastal development are modifying molluscan disease dynamics, ultimately leading to complex relationships between diseases and cultivated and natural molluscan populations. Further, in some instances the enhancement or restoration of valued ecosystem services may be contingent on management of molluscan disease. The application of newly emerging molecular tools and remote sensing techniques to the study of molluscan disease will be important in identifying how changes at varying spatial and temporal scales with global change are modifying host-parasite systems.","J Invertebr Pathol",1

Hirunpetcharat","A comparison of virus concentration methods for molecular detection and characterization of rotavirus in bivalve shellfish species","The objectives of this study were to develop a method for concentrating rotavirus, to assess the detection rate, and to characterize the genotype of naturally occurring rotavirus in bivalve shellfish species; including oysters (Saccostrea forskali), cockles (Anadara nodifera), and mussels (Perna viridis). The results demonstrated that an adsorption-twice elution-extraction method was less-time consuming method of concentrating the spiked rotavirus, yielding high sensitivity of 1.14 genome copies/g of digestive tissues from all three shellfish species, as detected using an RT-nested PCR. In seeding experiments, rotavirus as low as 1.39 genome copies was able to be detected in 4 g of digestive tissues or per sample. In the period of August 2011 to July 2012, of the 300 bivalve shellfish samples collected and tested, 24 (8.0%) were found to be contaminated with rotavirus, the figures being: oysters, 13/100 samples; mussels, 10/100 samples; and cockles, 1/100 samples. By DNA sequencing of the RT-nested PCR products and phylogenetic analysis, the rotaviruses detected were classified into G1, lineage II (4 samples); G3 (10 samples): lineage I (3 samples), lineage IIIc (3 samples), lineage IIId (3 samples), lineage IV (1 sample); G9 (6 samples); and G12, lineage III (1 sample). These findings suggest that this virus concentration method provides high sensitivity for the detection of rotavirus from the three bivalve shellfish species. The prevalence of rotavirus and the identified genotypes contribute to the molecular epidemiology of rotavirus in different shellfish species.","Food Microbiol",-1

Tamplin","Predictive model for the growth of spoilage bacteria on modified atmosphere packaged Atlantic salmon produced in Australia","Most existing models for the spoilage of modified atmosphere packed Atlantic salmon are based on the growth of the spoilage organism Photobacterium phosphoreum. However, there is evidence that this organism is not the specific spoilage organism on salmon produced and packaged in Australia. We developed a predictive model for the growth of bacteria in Australian-produced Atlantic salmon stored under modified atmosphere conditions (30-98% carbon dioxide in nitrogen) at refrigeration temperatures (0-10 degrees C). As expected, both higher levels of carbon dioxide and lower temperatures decreased the observed growth rates of the total population. A Belehradek-type model for growth rate fitted the data best with an acceptably low root mean square error. At low temperatures ( approximately 0 degrees C) the growth rates in this study were similar to those predicted by other models but at higher temperatures ( approximately 10 degrees C) the growth rates were significantly lower in the current study.","Food Microbiol",-1

To establish a fast, green and safe technology for the extraction and analysis of trace polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from oysters. Methods. With fresh oysters as blank sample matrix, the US EPA 16 PAHs standard addition recovery as experimental indexes, the process of sub-critical R134a extraction of PAHs was optimized. Results. The optimum conditions were extraction pressure 6.21 MPa, extraction temperature 42.7 ÁC, and co-solvent amount 3.39 mL. Under these conditions, the average spiked recoveries of 16 kinds of PAHs were 115.9%. Conclusion. This study can provide guidance for the extraction and analysis of PAHs in actual samples.","Journal of Food Safety and Quality",-1

Sulakvelidze","Bacteriophage cocktail significantly reduces or eliminates Listeria monocytogenes contamination on lettuce, apples, cheese, smoked salmon and frozen foods","ListShield, a commercially available bacteriophage cocktail that specifically targets Listeria monocytogenes, was evaluated as a bio-control agent for L. monocytogenes in various Ready-To-Eat foods. ListShield treatment of experimentally contaminated lettuce, cheese, smoked salmon, and frozen entrees significantly reduced (p < 0.05) L. monocytogenes contamination by 91% (1.1 log), 82% (0.7 log), 90% (1.0 log), and 99% (2.2 log), respectively. ListShield application, alone or combined with an antioxidant/anti-browning solution, resulted in a statistically significant (p < 0.001) 93% (1.1 log) reduction of L. monocytogenes contamination on apple slices after 24 h at 4 degrees C. Treatment of smoked salmon from a commercial processing facility with ListShield eliminated L. monocytogenes (no detectable L. monocytogenes) in both the naturally contaminated and experimentally contaminated salmon fillets. The organoleptic quality of foods was not affected by application of ListShield, as no differences in the color, taste, or appearance were detectable. Bio-control of L. monocytogenes with lytic bacteriophage preparations such as ListShield can offer an environmentally-friendly, green approach for reducing the risk of listeriosis associated with the consumption of various foods that may be contaminated with L. monocytogenes.","Food Microbiol",-1

Manes","Protective effect against mycotoxin occurrence of different additives in smoked fish","Mycotoxins are well known natural contaminants in plant feed material, which inclusion can introduce contaminants in feed. Thus, the use of these alternative feed ingredients can introduce contaminants, such as mycotoxins, that were previously not associated with marine salmon and other species. In previous studies, the presence of mycotoxins have been determined in feed and fish tissues from aquaculture (Tolosa et al., 2014). The increased use of raw materials and ingredients susceptible to mould contamination and the presence of those mycotoxins in animal tissues, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of different preservatives substances on mycotoxin contents in smoked fish commercially available. Ten samples of smoked salmon (Salmo salar), acquired in different markets located in Valencia, were analyzed for the determination of 22 mycotoxins (aflatoxins, enniatins, beauvericin, fumonisins, fusarenon-X, sterigmatocistin, trichothecenes, ochratoxin A and patulin). Quechers extraction was performed with acidified acetonitrile/water and determination in reverse phase with C18 column, water and methanol with 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid as mobile phase, by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-tandem mass spectrometry with linear ion trap (LC-MS/MS-IT). The results showed that mycotoxins were not present in any of the samples analyzed. These results were compared with those from a previous study where enniatins were present in 20% of salmon fillet samples, suggesting that preservatives substances and herbs commonly add to salmon (dill) and also treatments apply to smoked fish can protect fish from mycotoxin contamination. This effect was previously observed in lupine commercial samples commercialized with salt, acidulants and preservatives (Tolosa et al., 2013).
